b'![karafka logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karafka/misc/master/logo/karafka_logotype_transparent2.png)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/karafka/karafka.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/karafka/karafka)\n\n**Note**: Documentation presented here refers to Karafka `1.3.0`.\n\nIf you\'re upgrading from `1.2.0`, please refer to our [Upgrade Notes article](https://mensfeld.pl/2019/09/karafka-framework-1-3-0-release-notes-ruby-kafka/).\n\nIf you are looking for the documentation for Karafka `1.2.*`, it can be found [here](https://github.com/karafka/wiki/tree/1.2).\n\n## About Karafka\n\nFramework used to simplify Apache Kafka based Ruby applications development.\n\nKarafka allows you to capture everything that happens in your systems in large scale, providing you with a seamless and stable core for consuming and processing this data, without having to focus on things that are not your business domain.\n\nKarafka not only handles incoming messages but also provides tools for building complex data-flow applications that receive and send messages.\n\n## How does it work\n\nKarafka provides a higher-level abstraction that allows you to focus on your business logic development, instead of focusing on implementing lower level abstraction layers. It provides developers with a set of tools that are dedicated for building multi-topic applications similar to how Rails applications are being built.\n\n### Some things you might wonder about:\n\n- You can integrate Karafka with **any** Ruby-based application.\n- Karafka does **not** require Sidekiq or any other third party software (apart from Kafka itself).\n- Karafka works with Ruby on Rails but it is a **standalone** framework that can work without it.\n- Karafka has a **minimal** set of dependencies, so adding it won\'t be a huge burden for your already existing applications.\n- Karafka processes can be executed for a **given subset** of consumer groups and/or topics, so you can fine tune it depending on your business logic.\n\nKarafka based applications can be easily deployed to any type of infrastructure, including those based on:\n\n* Heroku\n* Capistrano\n* Docker\n* Terraform\n\n## Support\n\nKarafka has a [Wiki pages](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki) for almost everything and a pretty decent [FAQ](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/FAQ). It covers the whole installation, setup, and deployment along with other useful details on how to run Karafka.\n\nIf you have any questions about using Karafka, feel free to join our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/karafka/karafka) chat channel.\n\n## Getting started\n\nIf you\'re completely new to the subject, you can start with our "Kafka on Rails" articles series, that will get you up and running with the terminology and basic ideas behind using Kafka:\n\n- [Kafka on Rails: Using Kafka with Ruby on Rails \xe2\x80\x93 Part 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Kafka basics and its advantages](https://mensfeld.pl/2017/11/kafka-on-rails-using-kafka-with-ruby-on-rails-part-1-kafka-basics-and-its-advantages/)\n- [Kafka on Rails: Using Kafka with Ruby on Rails \xe2\x80\x93 Part 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Getting started with Ruby and Kafka](https://mensfeld.pl/2018/01/kafka-on-rails-using-kafka-with-ruby-on-rails-part-2-getting-started-with-ruby-and-kafka/)\n\nIf you want to get started with Kafka and Karafka as fast as possible, then the best idea is to just clone our example repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/karafka/example-app ./example_app\n```\n\nthen, just bundle install all the dependencies:\n\n```bash\ncd ./example_app\nbundle install\n```\n\nand follow the instructions from the [example app Wiki](https://github.com/karafka/example-app/blob/master/README.md).\n\n**Note**: you need to ensure, that you have Kafka up and running and you need to configure Kafka seed_brokers in the ```karafka.rb``` file.\n\nIf you need more details and know how on how to start Karafka with a clean installation, read the [Getting started page](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Getting-started) section of our Wiki.\n\n## Notice\n\nKarafka framework and Karafka team are __not__ related to Kafka streaming service called CloudKarafka in any matter. We don\'t recommend nor discourage usage of their platform.\n\n## References\n\n* [Karafka framework](https://github.com/karafka/karafka)\n* [Karafka Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/karafka/karafka)\n* [Karafka Coditsu](https://app.coditsu.io/karafka/repositories/karafka)\n\n## Note on contributions\n\nFirst, thank you for considering contributing to Karafka!
