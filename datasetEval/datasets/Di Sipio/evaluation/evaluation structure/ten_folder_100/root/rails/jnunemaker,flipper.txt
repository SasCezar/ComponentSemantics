Whatever your data store, throughput, or experience, feature flipping should be easy and have minimal impact on your application.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\n\n    gem 'flipper'\n\nAnd then execute:\n\n    $ bundle\n\nOr install it yourself with:\n\n    $ gem install flipper\n\n## Examples\n\nThe goal of the API for flipper was to have everything revolve around features and what ways they can be enabled. Start with top level and dig into a feature, then dig in further and enable that feature for a given type of access, as opposed to thinking about how the feature will be accessed first (ie: `stats.enable` vs `activate_group(:stats, ...)`).\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'flipper'\n\nFlipper.configure do |config|\n  config.default do\n    # pick an adapter, this uses memory, any will do\n    adapter = Flipper::Adapters::Memory.new\n\n    # pass adapter to handy DSL instance\n    Flipper.new(adapter)\n  end\nend\n\n# check if search is enabled\nif Flipper.enabled?(:search)\n  puts 'Search away!'\nelse\n  puts 'No search for you!'\nend\n\nputs 'Enabling Search...'\nFlipper.enable(:search)\n\n# check if search is enabled\nif Flipper.enabled?(:search)\n  puts 'Search away!'\nelse\n  puts 'No search for you!'\nend\n```\n\nOf course there are more [examples for you to peruse](examples/). You could also check out the [DSL](lib/flipper/dsl.rb) and [Feature](lib/flipper/feature.rb) classes for code/docs.\n\n## Docs\n\n* [Gates](docs/Gates.md) - Boolean, Groups, Actors, % of Actors, and % of Time\n* [Adapters](docs/Adapters.md) - Mongo, Redis, Cassandra, Active Record...\n* [Instrumentation](docs/Instrumentation.md) - ActiveSupport::Notifications and Statsd\n* [Optimization](docs/Optimization.md) - Memoization middleware and Cache adapters\n* [Web Interface](docs/ui/README.md) - Point and click...\n* [API](docs/api/README.md) - HTTP API interface\n* [Caveats](docs/Caveats.md) - Flipper beware!

Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\n3. Run the tests (`bundle exec rake`)\n4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\n5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\n6. Create new Pull Request\n\n## Releasing\n\n1. Update the version to be whatever it should be and commit.\n2. `script/release`\n3. Profit.\n\n## Brought To You By\n\n| pic | @mention | area |\n|---|---|---|\n| ![@jnunemaker](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/235?s=64) | [@jnunemaker](https://github.com/jnunemaker) | most things |\n| ![@alexwheeler](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3260042?s=64) | [@alexwheeler](https://github.com/alexwheeler) | api |\n| ![@thetimbanks](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/471801?s=64) | [@thetimbanks](https://github.com/thetimbanks) | ui |\n| ![@lazebny](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6276766?s=64) | [@lazebny](https://github.com/lazebny) | docker |\n"
