b'# Administrate\n\n[![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/thoughtbot/administrate.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/thoughtbot/administrate/tree/master)\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/administrate.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/administrate)\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/thoughtbot/administrate/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/thoughtbot/administrate)\n[![Reviewed by Hound](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reviewed_by-Hound-8E64B0.svg)](https://houndci.com)\n\nA framework for creating flexible, powerful admin dashboards in Rails.\n[Try the demo][demo].\n\n### Warning:\n\nAdministrate is still pre-1.0,\nand there may be occasional breaking changes to the API.\nCheck the [release notes] for important updates.\n\n[release notes]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/releases\n\n![administrate](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/903327/25823003/a5cc6aee-3408-11e7-8bcb-c62bb7addf40.png)\n\n## What Is Administrate?\n\nAdministrate is a library for Rails apps\nthat automatically generates admin dashboards.\nAdministrate\'s admin dashboards give non-technical users clean interfaces\nthat allow them to create, edit, search, and delete records\nfor any model in the application.\n\nAdministrate solves the same problem as [Rails Admin] and [ActiveAdmin],\nbut aims to provide a better user experience for site admins,\nand to be easier for developers to customize.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, Administrate follows a few guiding principles:\n\n- No DSLs (domain-specific languages)\n- Support the simplest use cases, and let the user override defaults with\n  standard tools such as plain Rails controllers and views.\n- Break up the library into core components and plugins,\n  so each component stays small and easy to maintain.\n\n[Rails Admin]: https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin\n[ActiveAdmin]: http://activeadmin.info/\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAdministrate supports Rails from 4.2, up to 5.0 and beyond. We support Ruby\n2.4 and up.\n\nAdd Administrate to your Gemfile and re-bundle:\n\n```ruby\ngem "administrate"\n```\n\nThe included installer will create dashboards for each model in your\napp, complete with routes:\n\n```bash\n$ rails generate administrate:install\n```\n\nRestart your server, and visit http://localhost:3000/admin\nto see your new dashboard in action.\n\nFor more detailed instructions or to make it work with Rails API-only applications, please go through the [\'Getting Started` guide](https://administrate-prototype.herokuapp.com/getting_started).\n\nIf your apps uses Sprockets 4, you\'ll need to add Administrate\'s assets to your `manifest.js` file. To do this, add these two lines to the file:\n\n```\n//= link administrate/application.css\n//= link administrate/application.js\n```\n\nOtherwise, your app will show you this error:\n\n```\nAsset `administrate/application.css` was not declared to be precompiled in production.\nDeclare links to your assets in `app/assets/config/manifest.js`.\n```\n\nFor more information on why this is necessary, see https://www.schneems.com/2017/11/22/self-hosted-config-introducing-the-sprockets-manifestjs\n\n## Create Additional Dashboards\n\nIn order to create additional dashboards, pass in the resource name to\nthe dashboard generator. A dashboard and controller will be created.\n\n```bash\n$ rails generate administrate:dashboard Foo\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo customize the appearance, behavior, and contents of the dashboard,\nsee the guides at\n[https://administrate-prototype.herokuapp.com][prototype_heroku].\nThese guides are available as markdown files in the `docs` subdirectory of the\ngit repository, too.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\nThis repository contains both the source code for Administrate,\nand a demo Rails app that uses Administrate.\nThe demo app is [hosted publicly on Heroku][demo].\n\n- The gem\'s source code lives in the `app` and `lib` subdirectories.\n- The demo app is nested within `spec/example_app`.\n- The guides as seen at\n  [https://administrate-prototype.herokuapp.com][prototype_heroku] live as\n  markdown files in the `docs` subdirectory.\n\nRails configuration files have been changed\nto recognize the app in the new location,\nso running the server or deploying to Heroku works normally.\n\nWith this structure, developing a typical feature looks like:\n\n- Add tests in `spec/`\n- Implement a feature in `administrate/`\n- Exercise the feature using the demo rails app (`spec/example_app/app/`)\n\n## Front-end Architecture\n\nThis project uses:\n\n- Sass\n- [BEM]-style CSS selectors, with [namespaces]\n- Autoprefixer\n- SCSS-Lint, with [Hound] ([configuration](.scss-lint.yml))\n- A variety of CSS units:\n  - `em` for typographical-related elements\n  - `rem` for lengths related to components\n  - `px` for borders, text shadows, etc.\n  - `vw`/`vh` for lengths that should be relational to the viewport\n\n[BEM]: http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/\n[namespaces]: http://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/\n[Hound]: https://houndci.com/\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nadministrate was originally written by Grayson Wright and is now maintained by\nNick Charlton.
