b'# MailCatcher\n\nCatches mail and serves it through a dream.\n\nMailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface. Run mailcatcher, set your favourite app to deliver to smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 instead of your default SMTP server, then check out http://127.0.0.1:1080 to see the mail that\'s arrived so far.\n\n![MailCatcher screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14028/14093249/4100f904-f598-11e5-936b-e6a396f18e39.png)\n\n## Features\n\n* Catches all mail and stores it for display.\n* Shows HTML, Plain Text and Source version of messages, as applicable.\n* Rewrites HTML enabling display of embedded, inline images/etc and opens links in a new window.\n* Lists attachments and allows separate downloading of parts.\n* Download original email to view in your native mail client(s).\n* Command line options to override the default SMTP/HTTP IP and port settings.\n* Mail appears instantly if your browser supports [WebSockets][websockets], otherwise updates every thirty seconds.\n* Runs as a daemon in the background, optionally in foreground.\n* Sendmail-analogue command, `catchmail`, makes using mailcatcher from PHP a lot easier.\n* Keyboard navigation between messages\n\n## How\n\n1. `gem install mailcatcher`\n2. `mailcatcher`\n3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:1080/\n4. Send mail through smtp://127.0.0.1:1025\n\nUse `mailcatcher --help` to see the command line options. The brave can get the source from [the GitHub repository][mailcatcher-github].\n\n### Bundler\n\nPlease don\'t put mailcatcher into your Gemfile. It will conflict with your applications gems at some point.\n\nInstead, pop a note in your README stating you use mailcatcher, and to run `gem install mailcatcher` then `mailcatcher` to get started.\n\n### RVM\n\nUnder RVM your mailcatcher command may only be available under the ruby you install mailcatcher into. To prevent this, and to prevent gem conflicts, install mailcatcher into a dedicated gemset with a wrapper script:\n\n    rvm default@mailcatcher --create do gem install mailcatcher\n    ln -s "$(rvm default@mailcatcher do rvm wrapper show mailcatcher)" "$rvm_bin_path/"\n\n### Rails\n\nTo set up your rails app, I recommend adding this to your `environments/development.rb`:\n\n    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp\n    config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { :address => \'127.0.0.1\', :port => 1025 }\n    config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false\n\n### PHP\n\nFor projects using PHP, or PHP frameworks and application platforms like Drupal, you can set [PHP\'s mail configuration](http://www.php.net/manual/en/mail.configuration.php) in your [php.ini](http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php) to send via MailCatcher with:\n\n    sendmail_path = /usr/bin/env catchmail -f some@from.address\n\nYou can do this in your [Apache configuration](http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php) like so:\n\n    php_admin_value sendmail_path "/usr/bin/env catchmail -f some@from.address"\n\nIf you\'ve installed via RVM this probably won\'t work unless you\'ve manually added your RVM bin paths to your system environment\'s PATH. In that case, run `which catchmail` and put that path into the `sendmail_path` directive above instead of `/usr/bin/env catchmail`.\n\nIf starting `mailcatcher` on alternative SMTP IP and/or port with parameters like `--smtp-ip 192.168.0.1 --smtp-port 10025`, add the same parameters to your `catchmail` command:\n\n    sendmail_path = /usr/bin/env catchmail --smtp-ip 192.160.0.1 --smtp-port 10025 -f some@from.address\n\n### Django\n\nFor use in Django, add the following configuration to your projects\' settings.py\n\n```python\nif DEBUG:\n    EMAIL_HOST = \'127.0.0.1\'\n    EMAIL_HOST_USER = \'\'\n    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = \'\'\n    EMAIL_PORT = 1025\n    EMAIL_USE_TLS = False\n```\n\n### API\n\nA fairly RESTful URL schema means you can download a list of messages in JSON from `/messages`, each message\'s metadata with `/messages/:id.json`, and then the pertinent parts with `/messages/:id.html` and `/messages/:id.plain` for the default HTML and plain text version, `/messages/:id/:cid` for individual attachments by CID, or the whole message with `/messages/:id.source`.\n\n## Caveats\n\n* Mail processing is fairly basic but easily modified. If something doesn\'t work for you, fork and fix it or [file an issue][mailcatcher-issues] and let me know. Include the whole message you\'re having problems with.\n* Encodings are difficult. MailCatcher does not completely support utf-8 straight over the wire, you must use a mail library which encodes things properly based on SMTP server capabilities.\n\n## TODO\n\n* Add mail delivery on request, optionally multiple times.\n* Compatibility testing against CampaignMonitor\'s [design guidelines](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/design-guidelines/) and [CSS support matrix](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/).\n* Forward mail to rendering service, maybe CampaignMonitor?\n\n## Thanks\n\nMailCatcher is just a mishmash of other people\'s hard work. Thank you so much to the people who have built the wonderful guts on which this project relies.\n\n## Donations\n\nI work on MailCatcher mostly in my own spare time.
