Payment engines are extensions to Catarse that implement a specific payment gateway logic.\n\nIf you have created a different payment engine to Catarse, please contact us so we can link your engine here.\nIf you want to create a payment engine, please join our mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/catarse-dev\n\n  List of payment enginees that are being developed or need to be developed further\n\n    https://github.com/catarse/catarse_pagarme (payment engine used by Catarse.me)\n    https://github.com/devton/catarse_paypal_express (currently out of date and not maintained)\n    https://github.com/sushant12/CatarseStripe (just starting to be developed and needs extra hands -- please pitch in...)\n\n## How to contribute with code\n\nDiscuss your plans in our mailing list (http://groups.google.com/group/catarse-dev).\n\nAfter that, just fork the project, change what you want, and send us a pull request.\n\n### Best practices (or how to get your pull request accepted faster)\n\n* Follow this style guide: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide\n* Create one acceptance tests for each scenario of the feature you are trying to implement.\n* Create model and controller tests to keep 100% of code coverage in the new parts you are writing.\n* Feel free to add specs to committed code that lacks coverage ;)\n* Let our tests serve as a style guide: we try to use implicit spec subjects and lazy evaluation wherever we can.\n\n## Credits\n\nAuthor: Daniel Weinmann\n\nContributors: You know who you are ;) The commit history can help, but the list was getting bigger and pointless to keep in the README.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Softa\n\nLicensed under the MIT license (see MIT-LICENSE file)\n'
