Make sure that you can run appropriate migrations by running: `rails active_storage:install`\n* Image resizing is done with with [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php), so make sure it\'s installed.\n* Pagination is handled by [kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari) or [will_paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate). Please add one of those to your Gemfile.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd gem definition to your Gemfile:\n\n```ruby\ngem "comfortable_mexican_sofa", "~> 2.0.0"\n```\n\nThen from the Rails project\'s root run:\n\n    bundle install\n    rails generate comfy:cms\n    rake db:migrate\n\nNow take a look inside your `config/routes.rb` file. You\'ll see where routes attach for the admin area and content serving. Make sure that content serving route appears as a very last item or it will make all other routes to be inaccessible.\n\n```ruby\ncomfy_route :cms_admin, path: "/admin"\ncomfy_route :cms, path: "/"\n```\n\n## Quick Start Guide\n\nAfter finishing installation you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin\n\nDefault username and password is \'username\' and \'password\'. You probably want to change it right away. Admin credentials (among other things) can be found and changed in the cms initializer: [/config/initializers/comfortable\\_mexican\\_sofa.rb](https://github.com/comfy/comfortable-mexican-sofa/blob/master/config/initializers/comfortable_mexican_sofa.rb)\n\nBefore creating pages and populating them with content we need to create a Site. Site defines a hostname, content path and its language.\n\nAfter creating a Site, you need to make a Layout. Layout is the template of your pages; it defines some reusable content (like header and footer, for example) and places where the content goes. A very simple layout can look like this:\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>{{ cms:text title }}</h1>\n    {{ cms:wysiwyg content }}\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nOnce you have a layout, you may start creating pages and populating content. It\'s that easy.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information on how to use this CMS please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/comfy/comfortable-mexican-sofa/wiki).
