But for a lot of us, it\'s a\nstruggle to be open about it. Not everyone is a counsellor or therapist. The\npeople who we interact with everyday shape our emotions and behavior. Getting\nthem involved in mental health treatment is the key to recovery.\n\nThe live site can be found at [if-me.org](https://www.if-me.org/). The live design systems can be found at [design.if-me.org](http://design.if-me.org/).\n\nWe use the wonderful [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) for\nour code of conduct.
