b"# Tracks: a GTD(TM) web application, built with Ruby on Rails\n\n* Project homepage: http://www.getontracks.org/\n* Manual: http://www.getontracks.org/manual/\n* Source at GitHub: https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks\n* Bug reports and feature requests: https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/issues\n* Wiki (community contributed information): https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/wiki\n* Mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/TracksApp\n* IRC channel: #tracks on Freenode\n* Original developer: bsag (http://www.rousette.org.uk/)\n* Contributors: https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/wiki/Contributors\n* Version: 2.4.1\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/actions)\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/TracksApp/tracks/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/TracksApp/tracks)\n\nFull instructions for both new installations and upgrades from older installations of Tracks\ncan be found within the /doc directory.\n\nThe instructions might appear long and intimidatingly complex, but that is\nmostly because of the number of different platforms supported, and the\ndifferent configurations which can be used (e.g. running Tracks on your local\ncomputer or on a remote server). If you choose the appropriate section for your\nsituation (installation vs. upgrade), and use the easiest (recommended) method,\nyou should find the instructions easy to follow. If you encounter problems, try\nsearching the wiki or mailing list (URLs above), and ask a question if\nyou cannot find a solution to your problem.\n\nThe wiki has a lot of user contributed installation HOWTOs for various webhosts, specific OS's and more.\n\nIf you are thinking about contributing towards the development of Tracks,\nplease read /CONTRIBUTING.md for general information. Also you can find\nsome information on development, testing and contributing on the wiki.\n\nWhile fully usable for everyday use, Tracks is still a work in progress. Make\nsure that you take sensible precautions and back up all your data frequently,\ntaking particular care when you are upgrading.\n\nEnjoy being productive!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCopyright (C) 2004-2016 rousette.org.uk\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
