It runs with all ruby versions (including ruby 2.x).\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor the complete documentation, take a look at the [project's wiki](https://github.com/codeplant/simple-navigation/wiki).\n\n## RDoc\n\nYou can consult the project's RDoc on [RubyDoc.info](http://rubydoc.info/github/codeplant/simple-navigation/frames).\n\nIf you need to generate the RDoc files locally, check out the repository and simply call the `rake rdoc` in the project's folder.\n\n## Online Demo\n\nYou can try simple-navigation with the [online demo](http://simple-navigation-demo.codeplant.ch).\n\nThe source code of this online demo is [available on Github](http://github.com/codeplant/simple-navigation-demo).\n\n## Feedback and Questions\n\nDon't hesitate to come talk on the [project's group](http://groups.google.com/group/simple-navigation).\n\n## Contributing\n\nFork, fix, then send a Pull Request.\n\nTo run the test suite locally against all supported frameworks:\n\n    % bundle install\n    % rake spec:all\n\nTo target the test suite against one framework:\n\n    % rake spec:rails-4-2-stable\n\nYou can find a list of supported spec tasks by running rake -T. You may also find it useful to run a specific test for a specific framework. To do so, you'll have to first make sure you have bundled everything for that configuration, then you can run the specific test:\n\n% BUNDLE_GEMFILE='gemfiles/rails-4-2-stable.gemfile' bundle install -j 4\n% BUNDLE_GEMFILE='gemfiles/rails-4-2-stable.gemfile' bundle exec rspec ./spec/requests/users_spec.rb\n\n### Rake and Bundler\n\nIf you use a shell plugin (like oh-my-zsh:bundler) that auto-prefixes commands with `bundle exec` using the `rake` command will fail.\n\nGet the original command with `type -a rake`:\n\n    % type -a rake\n    rake is an alias for bundled_rake\n    rake is /Users/username/.rubies/ruby-2.2.3/bin/rake\n    rake is /usr/bin/rake\n\nIn this situation `/Users/username/.rubies/ruby-2.2.3/bin/rake` is the command you should use.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 codeplant GmbH, released under the MIT license\n"
