Heroku\n\nRead the documentation on [deploying to Heroku][heroku deploy]\n\nYou can optionally create Heroku staging and production apps:\n\n    suspenders app --heroku true\n\nThis:\n\n* Creates a staging and production Heroku app\n* Sets them as `staging` and `production` Git remotes\n* Configures staging with `HONEYBADGER_ENV` environment variable set\n  to `staging`\n* Creates a [Heroku Pipeline] for review apps\n* Schedules automated backups for 10AM UTC for both `staging` and `production`\n\n[Heroku Pipeline]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pipelines\n[heroku deploy]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders/blob/master/docs/heroku_deploy.md\n\nYou can optionally specify alternate Heroku flags:\n\n    suspenders app \\\n      --heroku true \\\n      --heroku-flags "--region eu --addons sendgrid,ssl"\n\nSee all possible Heroku flags:\n\n    heroku help create\n\n## Git\n\nThis will initialize a new git repository for your Rails app. You can\nbypass this with the `--skip-git` option:\n\n    suspenders app --skip-git true\n\n## GitHub\n\nYou can optionally create a GitHub repository for the suspended Rails app. It\nrequires that you have [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub) on your system:\n\n    curl https://hub.github.com/standalone -sLo ~/bin/hub && chmod +x ~/bin/hub\n    suspenders app --github organization/project\n\nThis has the same effect as running:\n\n    hub create organization/project\n\n## Spring\n\nSuspenders uses [spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) by default.\nIt makes Rails applications load faster, but it might introduce confusing issues\naround stale code not being refreshed.\nIf you think your application is running old code, run `spring stop`.\nAnd if you\'d rather not use spring, add `DISABLE_SPRING=1` to your login file.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nSuspenders requires the latest version of Ruby.\n\nSome gems included in Suspenders have native extensions. You should have GCC\ninstalled on your machine before generating an app with Suspenders.\n\nUse [OS X GCC Installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/) for\nSnow Leopard (OS X 10.6).\n\nUse [Command Line Tools for Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)\nfor Lion (OS X 10.7) or Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8).\n\nWe use [Google Chromedriver] for full-stack JavaScript integration testing. It\nrequires Google Chrome or Chromium.\n\n[Google Chromedriver]: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home\n\nPostgreSQL needs to be installed and running for the `db:create` rake task.\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have problems, please create a\n[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders/issues).\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThank you, [contributors]!\n\n[contributors]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders/graphs/contributors\n\n## License\n\nSuspenders is Copyright \xc2\xa9 2008-2017 thoughtbot.\nIt is free software,\nand may be redistributed under the terms specified in the [LICENSE] file.\n\n[LICENSE]: LICENSE\n\n## About thoughtbot\n\n[![thoughtbot][thoughtbot-logo]][thoughtbot]\n\nSuspenders is maintained and funded by thoughtbot, inc.\nThe names and logos for thoughtbot are trademarks of thoughtbot, inc.\n\nWe love open source software!\nSee [our other projects][community].\nWe are [available for hire][hire].\n\n[thoughtbot]: https://thoughtbot.com?utm_source=github\n[thoughtbot-logo]: http://presskit.thoughtbot.com/images/thoughtbot-logo-for-readmes.svg\n[community]: https://thoughtbot.com/community?utm_source=github\n[hire]: https://thoughtbot.com?utm_source=github\n'
