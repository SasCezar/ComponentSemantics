So in case\nthere's a problem with the commit diff, we either commit another patch\nthereafter or plainly ask you to rework it. We might eventually squash some of\nyour commits into one.\n\nPlease always rebase your pull requests on a released version tag, one of the\nstable branches, or the default branch, ``master``.\n\nIf you request a pull against ``master``, your pull will be automatically closed\nupon merge. If you request against one of the stable release branches, your pull will be\nautomatically closed upon the next release.\n\nInformation on developing Munin with GitHub, such as how branches are used\nand the version numbering scheme, can be found in `Munin's GitHub Wiki`__.\n\n.. __ : https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin/wiki/_pages\n\n\nBuilding status\n---------------\n\nstable-2.0 : |build-stable2.0|\n\nmaster : |build-master|  |coverage-master|\n\ndocs : |docs-latest|\n\n.. |build-stable2.0| image:: https://travis-ci.org/munin-monitoring/munin.svg?branch=stable-2.0\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/munin-monitoring/munin\n\n.. |build-master| image:: https://travis-ci.org/munin-monitoring/munin.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/munin-monitoring/munin\n\n.. |coverage-master| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/munin-monitoring/munin/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/munin-monitoring/munin?branch=master\n\n\n.. |docs-latest| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/munin/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: http://guide.munin-monitoring.org/\n\n"
