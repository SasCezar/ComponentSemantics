The compute layer of LinDB, called brokers, supports efficient Multi-IDCs aggregation query.\n\n+ __High availability__\n\n  LinDB uses the ETCD cluster to ensure the meta-data is highly available and safely stored. \n  In the event of failure, the Multi-channel replication protocol of WAL will avoid the problem of data inconsistency:  \n\n  1). Only one person in each replication channel is responsible for the authority of the data, so the conflicts will not happen;  \n\n  2). Data reliability is guaranteed: as long as the data that has not been copied in the old leader is not lost, it will be copied to other replication while the old leader is online again; \n\n+ __Horizontal scalability__\n\n  Series(Tags) based sharding strategy in LinDB solves the hotspots problem, and is truly horizontally expanded available by simply adding new broker and storage nodes.\n  \n+ __Governance capability of metrics__\n\n  To ensure the robustness of the system, LinDB do not assume that users has understood the best practices of using metrics, therefore, LinDB provides the ability of restricting unfriendly user based on metric granularity and tags granularity.\n\n## State of this project\n\nThe current develop branch is unstable and is not recommended for production use. LinDB 0.1(what will be the first release version) is currently in the development stage. \nAdditional features will arrive during July and August, we will translate the JAVA version of LinDB currently used under the production environment to Golang as soon as possible.\nThe GO version is not only a simple translation of the JAVA version, but has been redesigned in many aspects.\n\nOnce we implement the final feature and replace the LinDB under production environment with the Golang version, LinDB 0.1.0 will be released. At that point, we will move into the stable phase, our intention is to avoid breaking changes to the API and storage file format.\n\n## Build(TODO)\n\n## Architecture\n\n![architecture](https://github.com/lindb/lindb/wiki/images/readme/lindb_architecture.jpg)\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcomed and greatly appreciated. See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on submitting patches and the contribution workflow.\n\n#### CI \nPull requests should be appropriately labeled, and linked to any relevant [bug or feature tracking issues](https://github.com/lindb/lindb/issues). \nAll pull requests will run through GITHUB-Actions. Community contributors should be able to see the outcome of this process by looking at the checks on their PR and fix the build errors.\n\n#### Static Analysis \nThis project uses the following linters. Failure during the running of any of these tools results in a failed build. Generally, code must be adjusted to satisfy these tools.\n\n- [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) - Gofmt checks whether code was gofmt-ed. By default this tool runs with -s option to check for code simplification;\n- [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint) - Golint differs from gofmt. Gofmt reformats Go source code, whereas golint prints out style mistakes;\n- [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports) - Goimports does everything that gofmt does. Additionally it checks unused imports;\n- [errcheck](https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck) - Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in go programs. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases;\n- [gocyclo](https://github.com/alecthomas/gocyclo) - Computes and checks the cyclomatic complexity of functions;\n- [maligned](https://github.com/mdempsky/maligned) - Tool to detect Go structs that would take less memory if their fields were sorted;\n- [dupl](https://github.com/mibk/dupl) - Tool for code clone detection;\n- [goconst](https://github.com/jgautheron/goconst) - Finds repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant;\n- [gocritic](https://github.com/go-critic/go-critic) - The most opinionated Go source code linter;\n\n## License\n\nLinDB is under the Apache 2.0 license.
