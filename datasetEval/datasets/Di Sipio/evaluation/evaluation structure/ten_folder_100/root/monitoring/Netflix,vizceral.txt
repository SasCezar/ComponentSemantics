If a graph of nodes and edges with data about traffic volume is provided, it will render a traffic graph animating the connection volume between nodes.\n\nThis component can take multiple traffic graphs and will generate a 'global' graph showing all incoming traffic into each of the 'regions', with support for cross-region traffic.\n\nThere are three levels of information, global, regional, and service-level, with clicking or double-clicking on a node bringing you one level deeper.\n\n## Not actively maintained\n\nWe are not using this internally at Netflix at this time and the project is not actively being worked on. We occasionally look at the repo and will review PRs as time permits.\n\n## Using\n\nSee [the wiki](https://github.com/Netflix/vizceral/wiki) for full documentation.\n\n## Developing Locally\n\nTo see your changes to `vizceral` locally, you'll need to link the package with bower:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/Netflix/vizceral.git\n    $ cd vizceral\n    $ npm link\n    $ npm run dev\n    $ cd /path/to/project-using-vizceral\n    $ npm link vizceral\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
