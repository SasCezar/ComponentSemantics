[Check-out our php-agent repository](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint-c-agent).\n\n## Latest Release (2019/09/18)\n\nWe\'re happy to announce the release of Pinpoint v1.8.5.\nPlease check the release note at (https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/releases/tag/1.8.5).\n\nThe current stable version is [v1.8.5](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/releases/tag/1.8.5).\n\n## About Pinpoint\n\n**Pinpoint** is an APM (Application Performance Management) tool for large-scale distributed systems written in Java / [PHP](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint-c-agent).\nInspired by [Dapper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html "Google Dapper"),\nPinpoint provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications.\n\nYou should definitely check **Pinpoint** out If you want to\n\n* understand your *[application topology](https://naver.github.io/pinpoint/overview.html#overview)* at a glance\n* monitor your application in *Real-Time*\n* gain *code-level visibility* to every transaction\n* install APM Agents *without changing a single line of code*\n* have minimal impact on the performance (approximately 3% increase in resource usage)\n\n## Getting Started\n * [Quick-start guide](https://naver.github.io/pinpoint/1.7.3/quickstart.html) for simple test run of Pinpoint\n * [Installation guide](https://naver.github.io/pinpoint/1.7.3/installation.html) for further instructions.\n \n## Overview\nServices nowadays often consist of many different components, communicating amongst themselves as well as making API calls to external services. How each and every transaction gets executed is often left as a blackbox. Pinpoint traces transaction flows between these components and provides a clear view to identify problem areas and potential bottlenecks.<br/>\nFor a more intimate guide, please check out our *[Introduction to Pinpoint](http://naver.github.io/pinpoint/#want-a-quick-tour)* video clip.\n\n* **ServerMap** - Understand the topology of any distributed systems by visualizing how their components are interconnected. Clicking on a node reveals details about the component, such as its current status, and transaction count.\n* **Realtime Active Thread Chart** - Monitor active threads inside applications in real-time.\n* **Request/Response Scatter Chart** - Visualize request count and response patterns over time to identify potential problems. Transactions can be selected for additional detail by **dragging over the chart**.\n\n  ![Server Map](doc/images/ss_server-map.png)\n\n* **CallStack** - Gain code-level visibility to every transaction in a distributed environment, identifying bottlenecks and points of failure in a single view.\n\n  ![Call Stack](doc/images/ss_call-stack.png)\n\n* **Inspector** - View additional details on the application such as CPU usage, Memory/Garbage Collection, TPS, and JVM arguments.\n\n  ![Inspector](doc/images/ss_inspector.png)\n\n## Supported Modules\n* JDK 6+\n* [Tomcat 6/7/8/9](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/tree/master/plugins/tomcat), [Jetty 8/9](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/tree/master/plugins/jetty), [JBoss EAP 6/7](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/tree/master/plugins/jboss), [Resin 4](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/tree/master/plugins/resin), [Websphere 6/7/8](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/tree/master/plugins/websphere), [Vertx 3.3/3.4/3.5](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/tree/master/plugins/vertx), [Weblogic 10/11g/12c](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/tree/master/plugins/weblogic), [Undertow](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/tree/master/plugins/undertow)\n* Spring, Spring Boot (Embedded Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow), Spring asynchronous communication\n* Apache HTTP Client 3.x/4.x, JDK HttpConnector, GoogleHttpClient, OkHttpClient, NingAsyncHttpClient, Akka-http, Apache CXF\n* Thrift Client, Thrift Service, DUBBO PROVIDER, DUBBO CONSUMER, GRPC\n* ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Kafka\n* MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL(jtds), CUBRID, POSTGRESQL, MARIA\n* Arcus, Memcached, Redis([Jedis](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/blob/master/plugins/redis), [Lettuce](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/tree/master/plugins/redis-lettuce)), CASSANDRA, MongoDB, Hbase\n* iBATIS, MyBatis\n* DBCP, DBCP2, HIKARICP, DRUID\n* gson, Jackson, Json Lib, Fastjson\n* log4j, Logback\n\n## Compatibility\n\nJava version required to run Pinpoint:\n\nPinpoint Version | Agent | Collector | Web\n---------------- | ----- | --------- | ---\n1.5.x  | 6-8  | 7-8 | 7-8\n1.6.x  | 6-8  | 7-8 | 7-8\n1.7.x  | 6-8  | 8   | 8\n1.8.0  | 6-10 | 8   | 8 \n1.8.1+ | 6-11 | 8   | 8 \n2.0.x  | 6-11 | 8   | 8\n\nHBase compatibility table:\n\nPinpoint Version | HBase 0.98.x | HBase 1.0.x | HBase 1.2.x | HBase 2.0.x\n---------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | -----------\n1.5.x | not tested | yes | not tested | no\n1.6.x | not tested | not tested | yes | no\n1.7.x | not tested | not tested | yes | no\n1.8.x | not tested | not tested | yes | no\n2.0.x | not tested | not tested | yes | optional\n\nAgent - Collector compatibility table:\n\nAgent Version | Collector 1.5.x | Collector 1.6.x | Collector 1.7.x | Collector 1.8.x | Collector 2.0.x\n------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------\n1.5.x | yes        | yes | yes | yes | yes\n1.6.x | not tested | yes | yes | yes | yes\n1.7.x | no         | no  | yes | yes | yes\n1.8.x | no         | no  | no  | yes | yes\n2.0.x | no         | no  | no  | no  | yes\n\nFlink compatibility table:\n\nPinpoint Version | flink 1.3.X | flink 1.4.X | flink 1.5.X | flink 1.6.X | flink 1.7.X\n---------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- \n1.7.x | yes | yes | no | no | no |\n1.8.x | yes | yes | no | no | no |\n2.0.x | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |\n\n## Contact Us\nWe have Chinese community now, welcome to join!\n\nQQ Group: 897594820 | DING Group\n:----------------: | :-----------: \n![QQ Group](doc/images/NAVERPinpoint.png) | ![DING Group](doc/images/NaverPinpoint\xe4\xba\xa4\xe6\xb5\x81\xe7\xbe\xa4-DING.jpg)\n\n\n## User Group\nFor Q/A and discussion [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pinpoint_user).\n\n## License\nPinpoint is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\nSee [LICENSE](LICENSE) for full license text.\n\n```\nCopyright 2018 NAVER Corp.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n\n'
