b'# Tessera\n\nTessera is a front-end interface for the [Graphite](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) metrics system, which provides a large selection of presentations, layout, and interactivity options for building dashboards.\n\nThe biggest key differences between Tessera and other frontends are the separation of queries from presentations, and the ability to apply arbitrary transformations to the presentations & queries, allowing for a large degree of interactivity. Tessera is initially focused on information presentation - it does not NOT address the areas of metric discovery or query composition (although it may in the future).\n\n## Overview\n\nTessera consists of a small python webserver written with Flask with a SQL backing store. The server manages storing and searching for dashboards, managing tags for organization, serving the basic UI assets, and providing a ReST API for the front-end to use.\n\nDashboards are big lumps of JSON data describing the queries, presentations, and layout, wrapped in a small shell of SQL metadata. Most of the heavy lifting is done by the javascript front-end, which is responsible for all rendering, data fetching from graphite, and editing of dashboards.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### From Docker\n\nIf you\'re familiar with [docker](http://www.docker.com) and already have a Graphite instance running, you can boot up an instance of tessera with the demo dashboards preloaded and easily point it at your existing Graphite installation using the [`aalpern/tessera-simple`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/aalpern/tessera-simple/) image. If you don\'t have a Graphite installation handy, a Docker image like [`nickstenning/graphite`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/nickstenning/graphite/) can get that up and running quickly.\n\n```\ndocker run -P -e GRAPHITE_URL=http://graphite.host -it aalpern/tessera-simple\n```\n\n\n### From PyPi\n\nTessera can be installed easily from\n[PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) with `pip` or\n`easy_install`. This method of installation is only recommended for\ncasual use.\n\n```\npip install tessera\n```\n\nAfter installation, create a `config.py` script for your local\nsettings.\n\nExample `config.py`:\n\n```\nGRAPHITE_URL="http://graphite.example.com"\nSECRET_KEY="adf71812-9d57-88d3-dfe8-1e9860d2b7ab"\n```\n\nInitialize the database:\n\n```\nTESSERA_CONFIG=/path/to/config.py tessera-init\n```\n\nThen launch the service:\n\n```\nTESSERA_CONFIG=/path/to/config.py tessera\n```\n\nThe service will be available on\n[localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) by default, with the demo\ndashoards loaded.\n\n### From Source\n\nThe TL;DR version:\n\n```\n./script/setup\n./script/server &\ncd tessera-server\ninv json.import \'../demo/*\'\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is hosted on GitHub Pages at\n[tessera-metrics.github.io/tessera/docs](http://tessera-metrics.github.io/tessera/docs/).\n\n* [Getting Started](http://tessera-metrics.github.io/tessera/docs/) for getting started and running from source and importing the demo dashboards.\n* [Tutorial](http://tessera-metrics.github.io/tessera/docs/guides/tutorial/) for creating the most basic possible\n  dashboard.\n* API [endpoints](http://tessera-metrics.github.io/tessera/docs/api/endpoints/) and [data format](http://tessera-metrics.github.io/tessera/docs/api/data-format/) for accessing Tessera via the HTTP REST API\n* [Extending Tessera](http://tessera-metrics.github.io/tessera/docs/development/extension/), for adding new dashboard\n  items, transformations, and actions.\n\nSome additional writeup of why Tessera exists can found on the\nintroductory blog post that was originally posted on Urban Airship\'s\ncompany blog -\n[Introducing Tessera, a Graphite Frontend](http://monster.partyhat.co/article/introducing-tessera/).\n\n![screenshot](docs/screenshots/color-themes-small.png)\n\n## Copyright & License\n\nCopyright &copy; 2014, Urban Airship and Contributors\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n* [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\nThird-party software libraries included with this project are\ndistributed under their respective licenses.\n'
