b'# Good bye, my friends! #\n\nMonths ago, I started a long and slow migration to fit new Android frameworks. Unfortunately, Twidere has hundreds of thousands lines of code, and over 50% needs to be rewritten because there\'re breaking changes. It\'s even impossible to maintain as publishing to Google Play requires new API target, and that target requires new libraries, and those libraries will break current code.\n\nSo It\'s time to say goodbye. Don\'t worry, I don\'t like Twitter\'s new timeline & ads as much as you do. I can\'t give any promise, but my plan is to start a new one, focusing on cleaness & simplicity. And before this proposed product, I want to build a web service to help you manage your Twitter data, such as removing spam followers (like [TwitBlock](https://twitblock.org/)). \n\nLet\'s looking forward to something better come to this world.\n\n# Twidere for Android #\n\n[![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-Twidere-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://android-arsenal.com/details/3/2453)\n[![Travis status](https://api.travis-ci.org/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android.png)](https://travis-ci.org/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android/)\n[![Crowdin](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/twidere/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/twidere)\n\nMaterial Design ready and feature rich Twitter app for Android 4.0+\n\n---\n\n## Features ##\n\n* Customizable Material Design\n* Night mode\n* Customizable tabs\n* Tweet with photos and videos\n* Powerful mute filters\n* Multiple account support\n* Custom API settings\n* Free, open source, NO ads, forever!\n\n## Enhanced Features (Available on Google Play) ##\n\n* Data sync with your cloud drive (Dropbox, Google Drive)\n* Filters subscription\n* Filters import\n* Schedule tweets even when you\'re offline by [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)\n* Search & share GIFs by [GIPHY](https://giphy.com/)\n\n[<img src="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png" alt="Get it on Google Play" height="80">](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mariotaku.twidere)\n[<img src="https://f-droid.org/badge/get-it-on.png" alt="Get it on F-Droid" height="80">](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.mariotaku.twidere)\n\n---\n\n## Credits ##\n\n### Material re-design ###\n\n* [@Uucky_Lee](https://twitter.com/Uucky_Lee)\n\n### Icon designers ###\n\n* [@NovaDNG](https://twitter.com/NovaDNG)\n* [@Linkzero](https://twitter.com/Linkzero)\n* [@lordfriend](https://twitter.com/lordfriend)\n* [@ilovinheart](https://twitter.com/ilovinheart)\n* [@Rieya](https://twitter.com/Rieya)\n\nThanks to their excellent design!\n\n### Open source projects ###\n\nSee dependencies in `build.gradle`\n\n---\n\n## Support my work ##\n\n### Translation ###\n\nI started a crowdin project, so anyone can do something for Twidere.
