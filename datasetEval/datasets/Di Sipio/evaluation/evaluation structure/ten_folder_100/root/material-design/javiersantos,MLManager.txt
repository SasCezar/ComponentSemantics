There are several things I require from all developers for the moment.\n\n1. Please do not use the name ML Manager for your app.\n2. Kindly do not use the standard logo as your app\'s logo.\n3. Please remember to read and follow the [GPL v3 license](https://github.com/javiersantos/MLManager/blob/master/LICENSE). Your derivate work must include this license.\n\nI ask that you do not redistribute this application for your own gain though. If you make a build and want to share it with people, that is great, that is what this should be for. Do not charge them for that build though. I have spent months creating this project and this is what I ask if you choose to make it for yourself.\n\n## Translations\n[Help translating this app](https://crowdin.com/project/ml-manager)\n* English\n* Spanish\n* Japanese\n* Portuguese\n* Italian - Thanks to Lucian Sipos -\n* Polish - Thanks to TykTak -\n\n## Third Party Libraries\n* [Material Design Library](https://github.com/navasmdc/MaterialDesignLibrary)\n* [Android Floating Action Button](https://github.com/futuresimple/android-floating-action-button)\n* [Material Dialogs](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs)\n* [Ambil Warna](https://github.com/yukuku/ambilwarna)\n* [Materialish Progress](https://github.com/pnikosis/materialish-progress)\n* [Material Drawer](https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer)\n* [RecyclerViewFastScroller](https://github.com/danoz73/RecyclerViewFastScroller)\n* [Phoenix](https://github.com/Yalantis/Phoenix)\n* [DirectoryChooser](https://github.com/passy/Android-DirectoryChooser)\n* [AboutLibraries](https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries)\n\n## License\n\n    Copyright 2015 Javier Santos\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
