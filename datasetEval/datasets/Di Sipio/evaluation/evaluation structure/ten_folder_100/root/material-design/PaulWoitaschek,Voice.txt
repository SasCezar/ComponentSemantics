I\'m integrating and validating new technologies and ideas here, playing around with new UI / UX components and developing with the best coding standard I come up with.\n\nAt the same time I want to provide an audiobook player which is really easy in use and a joy to work with.\nThere are still some components outdated.\n\nIf you like to [contribute](#contrib) or [translate](#trans), that is very appreciated. But there might be impacting structural changes over time.\n\n<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ph1b.audiobook"><img src="https://github.com/PaulWoitaschek/Voice/blob/master/Images/front.png" width="400" ></a>\n\n# <a name="contrib">Contribution</a>\n\n## Development\n\nIf you want to help check the label [PR-Welcome](https://github.com/PaulWoitaschek/Voice/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22PR+welcome%22).\nIts always a good idea to talk about what are going to do before you actually start it, so frustration can be avoided.\n\nSome rules for coding:\n* Use the code style the project uses\n* For each feature, make a seperate branch, so it can be reviewed separately\n* Use commits with a good description, so everyone can see, what you did\n\n## <a name="trans">Translations</a>\nThe project page is on [transifex](https://www.transifex.com/PaulWoitaschek/voice/). There all the localizations are maintained. If you want to contribute, check if there are untranslated or wrong translated words.\n\nOr you can start translating a new language if you speak it ;-)\n\n# License\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Paul Woitaschek](http://www.paul-woitaschek.de/)\n\nThe license is [GNU GPLv3](https://github.com/PaulWoitaschek/Voice/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
