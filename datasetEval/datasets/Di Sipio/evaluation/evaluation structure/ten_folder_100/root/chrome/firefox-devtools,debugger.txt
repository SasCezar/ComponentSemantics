It is designed to be approachable, yet powerful. And it is engineered to be predictable, understandable, and testable.\n\n[Mozilla] created this debugger for use in the [Firefox] Developer Tools. And we've purposely created this project in GitHub, using modern toolchains. We hope to not only create a great debugger that works with the [Firefox][firefox-rdp] and [Chrome][chrome-rdp] debugging protocols, but also develop a broader community that wants to create great tools for the web.\n\n![debugger-screenshot]\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Quick Setup](#quick-setup)\n- [Next Steps](#next-steps)\n- [Getting Involved](#getting-involved)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Discussion](#discussion)\n- [License](#license)\n\n### Quick Setup\n\n> Or take a look at our detailed [getting started][getting-started] instructions.\n\nFirst, get a recent version of Node.js to run the debugger.\n\n```bash\ncurl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash -s\ngit clone https://github.com/firefox-devtools/debugger.git\n\ncd debugger\nyarn\nyarn start\n# Go to http://localhost:8000\n```\n\nIf you are having problems with setting breakpoints in the debugger, launch [Firefox Nightly][firefox-nightly] instead of clicking on `Launch Firefox`.\n\n#### Next Steps\n\n- [`/claim`][cl] an [available] issue. If you get stuck, we'd be happy to [help].\n- Do our getting started activity _[Debugging the Debugger][first-activity]_.\n- Read the [app overview][app-overview], or [contributing][contributing] guidelines.\n- Watch a [video][getting-started-screencast] on contributing to the debugger, or [listen][changelog] to a podcast about the project.\n- Go to the [features][tracking] board to see what we're working on.\n\n### Getting Involved\n\nThis is an open source project, and we would love your help. We have prepared a [contributing] guide to help you get started.\n\nIf this is your [first PR][make-a-pull-request], or you're not sure where to get started,\nsay hi in [Slack][slack] and a team member would be happy to mentor you.\n\nWe strive for collaboration with [mutual respect for each other][contributing]. Mozilla also has a set of [participation guidelines] which goes into greater detail specific to Mozilla employees and contributors.\n\nHave you found a vulnerability in the debugger and want to report it? In that case, take\na look at [how we handle security bugs][vulnerabilities], and open a bug at [Bugzilla][bugzilla] so we can track the vulnerability while keeping users safe!\n\n### Development Guide\n\nWe strive to make the debugger as development-friendly as possible. If you have a question that's not answered in the guide, ask us in [Slack][slack]. We also :heart: documentation PRs!\n\n|                        |                                             |\n| :--------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |\n|        [Themes]        |       Theming changes for light, dark       |\n| [Internationalization] | Using or adding a localized string _(l10n)_ |\n|        [Prefs]         |         Using or adding preferences         |\n|         [Flow]         |   Flow best practices and common gotchas    |\n|       [Logging]        |      Tips for logging Redux and client      |\n|       [Testing]        |       Unit and integration test tips        |\n|       [Linting]        |          CSS, JS, Markdown linting          |\n|       [Configs]        |    How to use debugger settings locally     |\n\n### Documentation\n\nLooking for our documentation?
