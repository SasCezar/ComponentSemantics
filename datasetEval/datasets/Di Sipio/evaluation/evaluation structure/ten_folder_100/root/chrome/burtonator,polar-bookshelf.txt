PDFs work well when reading content in book format or when reading scientific\nresearch which is often stored as PDF.\n\n- **Captured Web Pages** Download HTML content and save them as offline documents which can be annotated.\n\n- **Pagemarks** Easily keep track of what you\'re reading and the progress of each document.\n\n- **Text Highlights** Highlight text in PDF and web pages.\n\n- **Area Highlights** Capture a region of the page as a highlight which can be a chart, figure, infographic, etc.  \n\n- **Local Storage** All content is stored locally. \n\n- **Hackable** The entire system is based on ```Electron```, ```Node```, ```pdf.js```, ```React``` and other web standards.  If you\'re a developer - welcome home!\n\n- **Standards Based** All content is stored as JSON in a well documented schema.  Annotations never mutate the original content.\n\n- **Portable** Run across any platform. ```Linux```, ```MacOS```, and ```Windows``` supported.  We also product snaps which means you can install our ```.deb``` files on ```Ubuntu``` or ```Debian``` but also any ```Linux``` distribution that supports snaps!\n\n\nWe hit 1.0 in 2018, and Polar\'s mature enough to be nearing\xe2\x80\x94or already\xe2\x80\x94best-in-class for PDF and (especially) web annotations.\n\n# Screenshots\n\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/master/docs/screenshots/pdf-loaded-shadow.png" align="center" title="PDF" style="box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);">\n\n<p align="center">\n    <b>PDF Document</b> Polar has excellent PDF support.\n</p>\n\n![Captured Web Content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/master/docs/screenshots/captured-web-content-shadow.png)\n\n<p align="center">\n    <b>Captured Web Content</b> Polar supports fetching and storing web content locally for annotating.\n</p>\n\n![Annotations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/master/docs/screenshots/annotations-shadow.png)\n\n<p align="center">\n    <b>Annotations</b> Annotating a PDF including pagemarks showing content already read, an area highlight, and a text highlight.\n</p>\n\n![Repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/master/docs/screenshots/repository-shadow.png)\n\n<p align="center">\n    <b>Repository</b> Polar includes a document repository manager to manage all\n    your documents, open up a new editor, sort them as a queue or by priority,\n    etc.\n</p>\n\n# [Downloads](https://getpolarized.io/download.html)\n\nPackages for Windows, MacOS, and Linux are available on the [downloads](https://getpolarized.io/download.html) page.\n\nWe also have a [CHANGELOG](./docs/CHANGELOG.md) available if you\'re interested into what went into each release.\n\n# Discussion\n\nWe have both a [Discord](https://discord.gg/GT8MhA6) group and\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PolarBookshelf/) group if you want to discuss\nPolar.\n\nIf it\'s a very technical issue it might be best to [create a Github Issue](https://github.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/issues/new). \n\n# Personal Knowledge Repository\n\nPolar is a document manager for PDF and web content as well as a personal\nknowledge repository.\n\nPolar allows you to keep all important reading material in one place including\nannotations and flashcards for spaced repetition.\n\nIt supports for features like pagemarks, text highlights, and progress tracking\nby keeping track of how much you\'ve read including restoring pagemarks when you\nre-open documents.\n\nPagemarks are a new concept for tracking your reading inspired from [incremental\nreading](https://getpolarized.io/incremental-reading.html).  They allow suspend\nand resume of reading for weeks and months in the future until you\'re ready to\nresume, without losing your place.\n\nSince you can create multiple pagemarks they work even if you jump around in a\nbook (which is often in technical or research work).\n\n# Web Content\n\nPDF is an excellent document format but we\'ve found that many HTML pages don\'t\nconvert to PDF well since they were not intended to be printed.\n\nCaptured pages contain HTML content stored in ```phz``` (Polar HTML zip) files.\n\nWe fetch all resources, render the page as DOM and apply CSS, then de-activate\nthe page by removing all scripts.\n\nWe then store the content in the phz archive format and serve the content\ndirectly to Electron.\n\nThis means you have long term storage for all your content. You can annotate it\nand use pagemarks without risk of the content changing.\n\nTo capture a new page just select ```File | Capture Web Page``` then enter a\nURL.\n\nAfter that the page will be captured and then loaded.\n\n# Local Storage\n\nAll annotations, documents, PHZ files and other data are persisted on disk in\nyour ```~/.polar``` directory (different on each platform) and when you re-open\na PDF or PHZ file your pagemarks and other annotations are restored.\n\nSince storage is local you\'re not reliant on one specific cloud provider. You can \nalso use tools like git or Dropbox to synchronize across machines.\n\n\n# Text Highlights\n\n![Text Highlight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/master/docs/screenshots/text-highlight-shadow.png)\n\nText highlights allow you to work with content like you\'re using a text\nhighlighter in a book.\n\n## Create a text highlight.\n\nSelect text you want to highlight then hit Ctrl-Alt-T\n\n## Delete a text highlight.\n\nRight click the highlight and select delete.\n\n## Key bindings:\n\n - Ctrl-Alt-T - create a new text highlight from the current selected text.\n\n\n# Area Highlights\n\n![Area Highlight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/master/docs/screenshots/area-highlight-shadow.png)\n\nArea highlights allow you highlight a figure, infographic, or anything visual \nin a document. \n\n## Create an area highlight.\n\nRight click on a page and select "Create area highlight"\n\n## Delete an highlight.\n\nRight click the highlight and select delete.\n\n# Flashcards\n\n![Flashcards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/master/docs/screenshots/flashcard2-shadow.png)\n\nFlashcards allow you to retain information long term by using a spaced repetition \nsystem like Anki to continually re-train yourself on material you want to retain.\n\nFlashcards can be created by right clicking an annotation and selecting \n"Create Flashcard".  The resulting flashcards are stored as annotations in your \nrepository.\n\nTo specify the Anki deck for a document, add a tag starting with `deck:`.  Slashes are used to specify subdecks.\nFor instance, to set a document to the Anki deck ML::100PageMLBook, use the Polar tag `deck:ML/100PageMLBook`.\n\n# Hackable\n\nSince the entire platform is based on Electron (Node + Chromium) the platform\nis very easy to work with which means developers can contribute easily.\n\nFeel free to fork and send a pull request if there\'s some interesting feature \nyou would like to add. [Here](https://github.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) is a list of good newcomer issues.\n\n# Data\n\nAll data is stored on disk in JSON format.  This also includes extracted metadata\nfrom the document.  For example, text highlights include the source text that you\ncopied as well as pointers into the original document where they can be found.\n\n# Principles\n\nWe believe the following design principles are core to seeing this as a\nsuccessful project.\n\n- All the data should support long term file formats.  The on disk format we\n  use is JSON.\n\n- Portability to all platforms is critical. We\'re initially targeting Linux (Ubuntu),\n  MacOS, and Windows.  You shouldn\'t have to pick a tool, which you might be\n  using for the next 5-10 years, and then get stuck to a platform which may\n  or may not exist in the future.\n\n## Build from source\n\nInstall NodeJS and npm for your platform.\n\n### To run:\n\nInstall latest **stable** node and npm versions.\n\nYou can check which version you need at \n\nhttps://nodejs.org/\n\n... then run: \n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf\n$ cd polar-bookshelf\n$ npm install && npm run-script compile && npm start\n```\n\n# Donations\n\nPolar is supported by [community donations](https://opencollective.com/polar-bookshelf) \n\nAll donations  go to supporting Polar which include website hosting costs, web designer costs, continual integration services, etc. \n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute. <img src="https://opencollective.com/polar-bookshelf/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false" />\n\n## Backers\n\nThank you to all our backers! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f [[Become a backer](https://opencollective.com/polar-bookshelf#backer)]\n\n<a href="https://opencollective.com/polar-bookshelf#backers" target="_blank"><img src="https://opencollective.com/polar-bookshelf/backers.svg?width=890"></a>\n\n\n## Sponsors\n\nSupport this project by becoming a sponsor.
