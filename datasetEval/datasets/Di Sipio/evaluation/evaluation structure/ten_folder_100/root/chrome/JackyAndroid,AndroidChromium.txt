The current build chromium version is 55.0.2883.99\n4. Because some Java file is through the C compiler generated, there is the chromium/src/out directory or exist in the jars.If according to corresponding relation between the above updated version missing files, please go to the out/directory search, add corresponding files according to the namespace.There are some temporary generated XML resource file also need the out/directory on copy to the corresponding resource module.\n\n### Thanks\n\nThe project is inspiration from the 365 browser\n\n### License\n\n    Copyright 2016 Jacky Wang<jacky.android@foxmail.com>\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n'
