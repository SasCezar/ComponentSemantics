Both Linux and macOS is supported, with Windows support \'partially working\'.\n\nInspiration for `gowitness` comes from [Eyewitness](https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/EyeWitness). If you are looking for something with lots of extra features, be sure to check it out along with these [other](https://github.com/afxdub/http-screenshot-html) [projects](https://github.com/breenmachine/httpscreenshot).\n\n## installation\n\nAll you would need is an installation of the latest Google Chrome or Chromium and `gowitness` itself. `gowitness` can be downloaded using `go get -u github.com/sensepost/gowitness` or using the\nbinaries available for download from the [releases](https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness/releases) page.\n\n## running using docker\n\nTo screenshot a page using docker, simply run the following command that would also pull the latest gowitness image:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/screenshots:/screenshots leonjza/gowitness:latest single --url=https://www.google.com\n```\n\nKeep in mind that a folder needs to be mounted into the container for `gowitness` to write your screenshots to, otherwise they will be lost when the container exits. The container is configured with the `/screenshots/` directory as the working directory, so the above command mounts a local `screenshots/` directory there.\n\nIf you want to read an nmap file, save it locally into a screenshots directory, and use it with:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/screenshots:/screenshots leonjza/gowitness:latest nmap -f /screenshots/nmap.xml\n```\n\nFor any other commands, you can get help similar to the local binary install. For example:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/screenshots:/screenshots leonjza/gowitness:latest -h\nA commandline web screenshot and information gathering tool by @leonjza\n\nUsage:\n  gowitness [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:\n  file        Screenshot URLs sourced from a file\n  help        Help about any command\n  nmap        Screenshot services from an Nmap XML file\n  report      Work with gowitness reports\n  scan        Scan a CIDR range and take screenshots along the way\n  single      Take a screenshot of a single URL\n  version     Prints the version of gowitness\n```\n\n## build from source\n\nTo build `gowitness` from source, follow the following steps:\n\n* Ensure that you have at least golang version 1.13.\n* Clone this repository and `cd` into it.\n* Run `go build` to get the `gowitness` binary for the current machine.\n* Or, `make` to build for all targets. Binaries will be in the `build/` diretory.\n\n## usage examples\n\n### screenshot a single website\n\n`$ gowitness single --url=https://www.google.com/`\n\nThis should result in a file being created called: `https-www.google.com.png`\n\n### screenshot a cidr\n\n`$ gowitness scan --cidr 192.168.0.0/24 --threads 20`\n\nThis should result in many `.png` images in the current directory when complete. This can would also use `20` threads and not the default of `4`.\n\n### generate a report\n\n`$ gowitness report generate`\n\nThis should result in an `report.html` file with a screenshot report.\n\n`$ gowitness report generate --sort-perception`\n\nThis should result in an `report.html` file with a screenshot report where screenshots are sorted using perception hashing.\n\n`$ gowitness report list`\n\nThis should list the entries in the `gowitness.db` file.\n\n## license\n\n`gowitness` is licensed under a [GNU General Public v3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
