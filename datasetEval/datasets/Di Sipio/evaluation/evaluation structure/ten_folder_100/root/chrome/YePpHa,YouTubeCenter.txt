See the wiki for details on how to install the extension and how it works: [https://github.com/YePpHa/YouTubeCenter/wiki](https://github.com/YePpHa/YouTubeCenter/wiki)\n\n## Contribute\nYou can contribute to YouTube Center by different means. You can help find bugs (and report them in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/YePpHa/YouTubeCenter/issues)), help with the translation to different languages or you can try and implement new things yourself.\n\n### Translation\nYouTube Center uses Crowdin to better manage the translations. If you want to help with the translation of YouTube Center you can find the project page on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.net/project/youtube-center).\n\n## Build\nYouTube Center is using the build system [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/).\n\n### Base requirements (you don\'t need these to run the extension)\n * Desktop Computer\n * [Java SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\n * [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)\n\n### Optional requirements\nTo build the Chrome or Maxthon extension it is required to be able to run executable, which can be done in Wine on Linux or on a Windows computer.\n\nIt is possible to build the unpacked version of the Chrome or Maxthon extension without the need to run executables:\n * `ant copy-chrome` -- Makes the required files to build the extension file (.crx) ready in the build directory.\n * `ant copy-maxthon` -- Makes the required files to build the extension file (.mxaddon) ready in the build directory.\n\n### Signing\nThe certificates for signing the extensions have to be provided by yourself and have to be placed in:\n * `/.cert/chrome/`\n * `/.cert/safari/`\n \nIt should be noted that the Ant build will create a new signing key for Chrome if it\'s missing from `/.cert/chrome/` (Running executables is required).\n \n### Ant\nThe build system is made in Ant and requires both Ant and Java to be installed.\n\n * `ant all` -- Build everything below except for the styles.\n * `ant devnumber` -- Increment the build number.\n * `ant firefox` -- Build the Firefox addon (.xpi)\n * `ant chrome` -- Build the Chrome extension (.crx)\n * `ant maxthon` -- Build the Maxthon extension (.mxaddon)\n * `ant opera` -- Build the Opera extension (.oex)\n * `ant userscript` -- Build the userscript (.user.js)\n * `ant safari` -- Makes everything ready for Safari to finish building YouTube Center.\n * `ant styles` -- Minifies the styles used. This is needed to be called everytime a change in the styles is made.\n * `ant language` -- Retrieves the newest translations for YouTube Center and stores it as a JSON file.\n\n### Build Properties (build.properties)\nThe keys in this file have the prefix and suffix `@`.\n\n * `devbuild` -- Set to true if you want to create a developer build and false if it\'s a stable release.\n * `ant-version` -- The stable version.\n * `ant-revision` -- The stable revision used to check if it\'s a newer version.\n * `pastebin-api-key` -- The pastebin API key used by YouTube Center to post the debug log on pastebin.\n * `name-stable` -- The name of the extensions for the stable version.\n * `name-dev` -- The name of the extensions for the developer version.\n * `stable-downloadURL` -- The location of the newest version of YouTube Center for the stable version.\n * `stable-updateURL` -- The location of the userscript header to check if a new version of YouTube Center is available for the stable version.\n * `dev-downloadURL` -- The location of the newest version of YouTube Center for the developer version.\n * `dev-updateURL` -- The location of the userscript header to check if a new version of YouTube Center is available for the developer version.\n * `firefox-target-id` -- Used in the Firefox extension manifest to specify which platform the extension is targeted towards.\n * `firefox-target-min-version` -- The minimum version of the targeted platform.\n * `firefox-target-max-version` -- The maximum version of the targeted platform.\n * `firefox-target-mobile-id` -- The mobile platform id.\n * `firefox-target-mobile-min-version` -- The minimum version of the mobile platform.\n * `firefox-target-mobile-max-version` -- The maximum version of the mobile platform.\n * `firefox-update-link` -- The location of the newest version of the developer version of YouTube Center for Firefox is located.\n * `firefox-update-rdf` -- The location of the file, which Firefox uses to check if a new version of the developer version of YouTube Center is available.\n * `chrome-id` -- The id of the Chrome extension.
