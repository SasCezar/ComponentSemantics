Don\'t fall for this creepy idea. The _ultimate_ logical consequence of `blocking = theft` is the criminalisation of the inalienable right to privacy.\n\n* _EasyList_, _Acceptable Ads_, _ABP Anti-Circumvention Filter List\xe2\x80\x8e_ and _Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) Mining Protection List\xe2\x80\x8e_ are enabled by default when you install uBlock. Many more lists are readily available to block trackers, analytics, and more. Hosts files are also supported.\n\n* Once you install uBlock, you can easily un-select any of the pre-selected filter lists if you think uBlock blocks too much. For reference, Adblock Plus installs with only _EasyList_ enabled by default.\n\n* Feel free to read [about the extension\'s required permissions](https://github.com/uBlock-LLC/uBlock/wiki/About-the-required-permissions).\n\n## About uBlock\n\nSome users might want to check out [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock): a noteworthy personal fork of uBlock from @gorhill with a slightly different featureset.\n\nuBlock is a general-purpose content blocker, which means it can be used to block ads as well as other forms of content on webpages. uBlock can also be used to help users neutralize privacy-invading trackers. uBlock blocks ads through its support of the [Adblock Plus filter syntax](https://adblockplus.org/en/filters). uBlock [extends](https://github.com/uBlock-LLC/uBlock/wiki/Filter-syntax-extensions) the syntax and is designed to work with custom rules and filters. If uBlock is useful to you, [donations to support development are much appreciated](https://www.ublock.org/donate/).\n\n** Please note [recent news](https://www.ublock.org/announcement/) about the status of the uBlock project as of June 22, 2018.**\n\n*Acknowledgment:* uBlock comes with several filter lists ready to use out-of-the-box (including but not limited to: EasyList, Peter Lowe\'s, several malware filter lists). We deeply appreciate the people working hard to maintain those lists which are available to use by all for free.\n\n## License\n\n[GPLv3](https://github.com/uBlock-LLC/uBlock/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).\n'
