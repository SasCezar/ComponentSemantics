Make sure you\'ve added [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) to Chrome. \n\n2. Install [React Sight](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-sight/aalppolilappfakpmdfdkpppdnhpgifn) from the Chrome web store\n\n3. If you are running local file URLs, make sure to enable "Allow access to file URLs" in the extension settings for both React Dev Tools and React Sight\n\n4. Run your React application, or open (almost!) any website running React!\n\n5. Open Chrome Developer Tools (cmd+opt+j) -> React Sight panel\n\n## Building Your Own Version\n\nIf you\'d like to build your own version of React Sight:\n\n1. Clone the repo and `npm install` dependencies\n\n2. Use `npm start` to generate the build \n\n3. In Chrome, open the extensions tab and click \'Load Unpacked Extension\'. Load the folder \'~/ReactSight/chrome-ext\'\n\nIf you have any additional questions send us a message at reactsight@gmail.com :)\n\n## Usage\n\nHover over nodes to see their state and props in the side panel. \n\nHide DOM elements, Redux components, and Router components with the built in filters, so that you can focus only on the components you\'ve written\n\nZoom in by double clicking, and zoom out by shift + double clicking (mousewheel zoom coming soon!)\n\n## Why?\n\nWe built React Sight because there are no tools on the market that give you a visual representation of the structure of your App. When we were developing our own projects, we wished we had a way to see how everything was structured.\n\nWe wanted React Sight to be simple to use, which is why all you have to do is install a Chrome extension. No modifying your existing code!\n\n## How Does It Work?\n\nWhen the dev tools are opened, React-Sight searches for React renderer\'s, and patches the render to collect data on each state change.\n\nData is posted to the Window, where it is read by Chrome\'s background.js window, and is then relayed to React-Sight\'s devTools page.\n\nThe raw data is then processed and fed to D3, where it is displayed to the user.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n\'React not found\' or no data:\n\nSometimes React-Sight doesn\'t get a snapshot of the data at load, triggering a setState ussually fixes this\n\nMaximum call stack exceeded and other console errors:\n\nThis is a bug where the parsing functions get stuck in an infinite loop. We are working on a fix.\n\n## Testing\n\nRun `npm test` to run the test suite\n\n## Contributing\n\nFound a bug? Have a suggestion? Want to make React-Sight better?\n\nPlease submit issues/pull requests if you have feedback or would like to contribute. If you\'re interested in joining the React Sight team as a contributor, feel free to message one of us directly, or just start submitting pull requests!\n\n## Authors\n\nDavid C Sally (https://github.com/davidcsally)\n\nGrant Kang (https://github.com/Grant05)\n\nWilliam He (https://github.com/hewilliam)\n\n## Contact\n\nLike our app? Found a bug? \n\nTell us what you think!\n\nreactsight@gmail.com\n\nVisit us at www.reactsight.com\n\n## Roadmap \n\nHere\'s our top development priorities\n\n1. Better support across all React versions, especially fiber\n2. More consistent detection of root nodes when React Sight is opened\n3. Support for multiple React Applications / mounting nodes \n4. More robust error handling and guard blocks for extracting state, props, and store\n5. Logging / Debugging mode for development, feedback, and error reporting\n6. Performance and stability updates\n7. Mousewheel zoom in D3 chart (if you can solve this I will order you \xf0\x9f\x8d\x95)\n8. UX improvements\n9. Improved documentation\n10. Hook into React DevTool\'s reporting so that we don\'t have to reimplement it :)\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details\n'
