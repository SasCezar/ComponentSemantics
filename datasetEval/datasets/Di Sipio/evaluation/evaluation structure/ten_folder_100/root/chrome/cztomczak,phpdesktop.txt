Think\nof it as Electron for PHP. It is a convienient tool for converting PHP\nweb apps and PHP CLI tools to desktop applications with little effort.\nThe development workflow you are used to while creating web applications\nremains the same, there is no new framework / API to learn. The process\nof turning an existing website into a desktop application is basically\na matter of copying it to the "phpdesktop/www/" directory.\n\nIn a certain sense phpdesktop acts as a PHP to EXE compiler. It embeds\na web browser, a multi-threaded web server and a PHP interpreter. All\nembedded into a single application, a portable folder that you can easily\ndistribute to end users by packing it to zip archive or by making an\n[installer for your application](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#application-installer).\nThe web server embedded is a custom edition of\n[Mongoose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoose_(web_server)),\na web server used by NASA on International Space Station.\nSupported browsers are Internet Explorer and Google Chrome via\nopen source Chromium. The package with Chrome embedded has no\nexternal dependencies, everything is included in phpdesktop binaries\nand works out of the box on a user\'s computer.\n\nAll popular PHP frameworks are supported, see the\n[PHP frameworks support](../../wiki/PHP-frameworks-support) wiki page\nfor example configurations for CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Symfony, Yii\nand Zend Framework.  You can create a standalone executable for\ndistribution with the help of the\n[Inno Setup installer](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#application-installer).\nPHP sources can be protected with the many of the available\n[PHP encoders](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#how-do-i-protect-php-sources-in-the-www-directory).\nPHP Desktop is released under non-restrictive license, thus it is\n[free for commercial use](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#can-i-use-php-desktop-in-a-commercial-closed-sourced-project).\n\nIt is one of the top goals for PHP Desktop to be stable, to work reliably.\nPHP Desktop does not suffer from memory leaks. PHP by design was never\nintended for running long hours/days, as desktop applications usually do.\nThis is not a concern when using PHP Desktop, as it is running an internal\nweb server and serving pages through CGI. So when PHP script execution\nends, PHP-CGI process is killed and all memory is always freed.\n\nLots of other useful information can be found on the\n[Knowledge Base](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base) wiki page and on the\n[PHP Desktop Forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/phpdesktop).\n\n\n## Downloads\n\n  * Windows\n    - [PHP Desktop v57.0 for Windows\n](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/releases/tag/chrome-v57.0-rc)\n      release\n    - [PHP Desktop MSIE v1.14](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/wiki/PHP-Desktop-MSIE-v1.14)\n      wiki page\n  * Linux\n    - [PHP Desktop v72.1 for Linux](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/releases/tag/linux-v72.0)\n    release\n  * Mac\n    - No release yet, see the ongoing funding in\n      [Issue #208](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/issues/208)\n\nThere are two ways to be notified about new releases:\n- Watch the project with the "Releases only" option checked\n- Subscribe to the [RSS/Atom feed](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/releases.atom)\n\n\n## Support\n\n* Documentation is on the [Wiki Pages](../../wiki).

Most notable are:\n\n* Monthly releases with latest Chrome\n* An automated build system\n* Cross-platform support with full functionality on Mac and Linux\n* More Javascript and PHP API exposed for accomplishing desktop specific tasks\n* Better integration with desktop, taskbar and systray\n* HTTPS/SSL support\n* Custom window themes\n* Running app in background\n* SQLite encryption\n* Desktop notifications\n\nIf your company would like to sponsor PHP Desktop development efforts\nthen please contact [Czarek](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17xmoT5Z_zTHkVclqPzrs2aAV64Uiu7fh/view). Long term sponsorships are welcome and Czarek is open to ideas about\nthe project. He would love to spend more time on developing this project,\nbut he can\'t afford doing so in his free time.\n'
