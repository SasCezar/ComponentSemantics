Jetpack can be used instead of webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server and webpack-dev-middleware without writing any configuration. Jetpack is a thin wrapper around webpack, and can be extended with any webpack configuration.\n\n- **Sensible defaults** to handle modern JavaScript, CSS and images.\n- **Preconfigured Babel** with `@babel/preset-env` and `@babel/preset-react`, configurable via `.babelrc`.\n- **Preconfigured PostCSS** with `postcss-preset-env` including autoprefixing, configurable via `postcss.config.js`.\n- **Differential builds and serving** with modern/legacy bundles served to browsers based on user agent headers.\n- **CSS modules available** by switching one config flag.\n- **Sass support** by installing `node-sass`.\n- **Automatic JSX detection** switches between `React.createElement` or `h` depending on dependencies.\n- **Hot reloading built in** for React as well as vanilla JavaScript and CSS.\n- **Automatic chunk splitting** with inlined runtime and HTML generation.\n- **Smooth workflow** for simultaneously developing client and server applications.\n- **Single dependency** with hassle-free updates.\n- **Optionally run anywhere** without installing locally, just like `nodemon`.\n\n**Why use jetpack?** To avoid rolling your own custom webpack config or having to paste it from old projects. Jetpack has a set of defaults that should get you off the ground quickly. And with the `proxy` config or universal `jetpack/serve` middleware you don\'t have to worry about wiring up webpack dev middleware or dev server \xe2\x80\x93 everything _just works_.\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall globally or locally:\n\n    $ npm install -g jetpack\n\nIn your project with `package.json` or `index.js`, start your app on `http://localhost:3030`:\n\n    $ jetpack\n\nTo build the app for production to a `dist` directory:\n\n    $ jetpack build\n\nInspect the bundle size and make up:\n\n    $ jetpack inspect\n\nPrint what browsers will be supported:\n\n    $ jetpack browsers\n    $ jetpack browsers --coverage=GB\n\n## Use jetpack anywhere, anytime\n\nOne of jetpack goals is to help you run any piece of JavaScript in a browser as easily as it is to run node scripts. Install jetpack globally and point it to any file on your machine. This is an alternative to jsfiddle / codepen / codesandbox style of hacking on things.\n\n    $ jetpack ~/Desktop/magic.js\n\nOr any project on your machine:\n\n    $ jetpack --dir ~/projects/manyverse\n\n## Use jetpack with an API\n\nAnother goal of jetpack is to assist you in building complete, production apps. Very often in addition to developing the clientside application, you are also developing an API. Jetpack has a few features to make building such apps easier.\n\nPoint your `package.json#main` to your server entry and `package.json#browser` to your client entry.\n\nNow you can run your API server together with jetpack in a single command:\n\n    $ jetpack -x\n\nAlternatively, specify any command to execute:\n    $ jetpack -x \'nodemon ./api\'\n\nUse this even if your server is not written in node\n\n    $ jetpack -x \'rails s\'\n\nJetpack provides an ability to proxy requests to your api by specifying `proxy` configuration in `jetpack.config.js` or mounting the dev server to your application server using the `jetpack/serve` middleware.

Webpack is a very powerful and flexible tool. It applies to a lot of use cases and that is one of the reasons it has so many configuration options. Webpack also evolved over the years but preserved backward compatibility as much as possible to support the large ecosystem built around it.\n\nJetpack is an exploration of how using webpack could be made easier if the defaults, the CLI usage patterns and the configuration would be different.\n'
