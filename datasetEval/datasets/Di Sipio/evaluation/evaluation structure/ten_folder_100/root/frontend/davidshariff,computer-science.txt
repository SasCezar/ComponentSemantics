b'# Computer Science in JavaScript\n\nContains the basic fundamental data structures and algorithms a front end engineer should know, written all in JavaScript.\n\nFront end engineers need to know a mixture of technologies and methodologies from JavaScript, CSS, HTML to design patterns, MVC/MVVM, browser performance and responsive design to name but a few concepts.\n\nHowever, Computer Science, and in particular data structures and algorithms are often ignored. While you may not use these on a day to day basis, user interfaces are becoming more complex and feature rich. \n\nEvery front end engineer should be able to grasp the fundamentals of the following:\n\n## Data Structures\n\n* Binary Trees\n* Doubly Linked Lists\n* HashTables\n* MaxHeaps\n* Queues\n* Singly Linked Lists\n* Stacks\n* Tries\n\n## Sorting Algorithms\n\n* Binary Search\n* Merge Sort\n* Quick Sort\n'
