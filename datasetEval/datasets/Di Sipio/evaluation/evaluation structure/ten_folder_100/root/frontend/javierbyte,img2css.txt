b'# img2css\n\nConvert any image to pure CSS.\n\n[Live demo](http://javier.xyz/img2css/)\n\n[![img2css](docs-assets/screenshot.jpg)](http://javier.xyz/img2css/)\n\n## How does it works?\n\nWell, it just puts the image in a canvas, calculates an array with the rgb values, and then... creates a single pixel shadow for each value!\n\n## Why?\nHum... to demonstrate the power of CSS!\n\nAnd this may have other interesting applications, like creating loading screens with pixel art or pixel-level animation.\n\nI made another proof-of-concept using pixel-level animations here http://javier.xyz/morphin/\n\n## Planned features\n* Make the result smaller with smarter shadows and common background detection.\n* Make animation and image morphing by using css transitions on the shadows. See http://javier.xyz/morphin/\n* Add scale options to better support pixel art.\n* Support for custom image filters.\n\n## Development\nRun development server:\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nBuild \n\n```\nnpm run build\n```'
