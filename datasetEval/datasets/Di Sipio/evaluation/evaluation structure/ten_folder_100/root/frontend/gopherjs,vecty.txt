It competes with modern web frameworks like React & VueJS, and supports compilation to both WebAssembly and vanilla JavaScript.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gopherjs/vecty.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gopherjs/vecty) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopherjs/vecty?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopherjs/vecty) [![codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/gopherjs/vecty/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/gopherjs/vecty)\n\nBenefits\n========\n\n- Go developers can be competitive frontend developers.\n- Share Go code between your frontend & backend.\n- Reusability by sharing components via Go packages so that others can simply import them.\n\nGoals\n=====\n\n- _Simple_\n\t- Designed from the ground up to be easily mastered _by newcomers_ (like Go).\n- _Performant_\n\t- Efficient & understandable performance, small bundle sizes, same performance as raw JS/HTML/CSS.\n- _Composable_\n\t- Nest components to form your entire user interface, seperating them logically as you would any normal Go package.\n- _Designed for Go (implicit)_\n\t- Written from the ground up asking the question _"What is the best way to solve this problem in Go?"_, not simply asking _"How do we translate $POPULAR_LIBRARY to Go?"_\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n- Compiles to WebAssembly (via standard Go compiler) and vanilla JavaScript (via [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs)).\n- Small bundle sizes: 0.5 MB hello world (see section below).\n- Fast expectation-based browser DOM diffing (\'virtual DOM\', but less resource usage).\n\nCurrent Status\n==============\n\n**Vecty is currently considered to be an experimental work-in-progress.** Prior to widespread production use, we must meet our [v1.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/gopherjs/vecty/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.0.0) goals, which are being completed slowly and steadily as contributors have time (Vecty is over 4 years in the making!).\n\nEarly adopters may make use of it for real applications today as long as they are understanding and accepting of the fact that:\n\n- APIs will change (maybe extensively).\n- A number of important things are not ready:\n\t- Extensive documentation, examples and tutorials\n\t- URL-based component routing\n\t- Ready-to-use component libraries (e.g. material UI)\n\t- Server-side rendering\n\t- And more, see [milestone: v1.0.0 ](https://github.com/gopherjs/vecty/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.0.0)\n- The scope of Vecty is only ~80% defined currently.\n- There are a number of important [open issues](https://github.com/gopherjs/vecty/issues).\n\nFor a list of projects currently using Vecty, see the [doc/projects-using-vecty.md](doc/projects-using-vecty.md) file.\n\nSmall bundle sizes\n==================\n\nVecty uses extremely minimal dependencies and prides itself on producing very small bundle sizes (mostly limited by the compiler), making it suitable for modern web development:\n\n| Example      | Compiler                | Bundle size | Compressed (gzip) |\n|--------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `hellovecty` | Go + WebAssembly        | 2.3 MB      | 0.5 MB            |\n| `markdown`   | Go + WebAssembly        | 4.2 MB      | 0.9 MB            |\n| `todomvc`    | Go + WebAssembly        | 3.4 MB      | 0.7 MB            |\n| `hellovecty` | GopherJS                | 0.5 MB      | 0.1 MB            |\n| `markdown`   | GopherJS                | 2.6 MB      | 0.4 MB            |\n| `todomvc`    | GopherJS                | 1.7 MB      | 0.3 MB            |\n\nCommunity\n=========\n\n- Join us in the [#gopherjs](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/gopherjs/) and [#vecty](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/vecty/) channels on the [Gophers Slack](https://gophersinvite.herokuapp.com/)!\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nSee the [doc/CHANGELOG.md](doc/CHANGELOG.md) file.\n'
