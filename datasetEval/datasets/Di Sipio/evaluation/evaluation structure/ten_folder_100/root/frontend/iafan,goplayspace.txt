b'About Go Play Space\n===================\n\nGo Play Space is an experimental alternative [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org)\nfrontend that is built in Go itself (using [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs)),\na Go&rarr;JavaScript transpiler, and [Vecty](https://github.com/gopherjs/vecty),\na React-like frontend library for GopherJS).\n\nTry it: [https://goplay.space](https://goplay.space/)\n=====\n\n![demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1728158/26770686/b3f0a4d0-496d-11e7-8be2-9ab88e856b8c.gif)\n\nGo Play Space supports the [Turtle graphics mode](https://goplay.space/#draw) to help visualize algorithms and make learning experience more fun.\n\n![draw mode demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1728158/29108287-12dfd26a-7c93-11e7-966d-713356bce3d3.gif)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n1. Syntax highlighting, auto-closing braces and quotes, proper undo/redo, auto indentation\n2. Smart help lookup: double-click on e.g. <code>package</code> keyword\n   or <code>Println</code> function name in source code, and you will see\n   the relevant help topic.\n3. Live syntax error checking\n4. Error line highlighting (both for syntax errors and for errors\n   returned from the compiler)\n5. Ability to highlight lines and blocks of code (like on Github, but better!) \xe2\x80\x94\n   just click on the line numbers. Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>\n   to modify the selection\n6. Keyboard shortcuts (see button captions)\n7. Support for several UI themes\n8. Support for [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font\n   (either the one installed in your system or a webfont)\n9. `go imports` is always run before running your code, so you don\'t usually\n   have to worry about imports at all\n\nCode execution is proxied to the official Go Playground, so your programs will work the same.\nShared snippets are also stored on golang.org servers.\n\nRunning Locally\n----------------\n\nDownload the package:\n\n```sh\n$ go get -u github.com/iafan/goplayspace/...\n```\n\nCompile both client-side code and server binary:\n```sh\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/iafan/goplayspace/bin\n$ ./build-client && ./build-server\n```\n\nRun the server:\n\n```sh\n$ ./goplayspace\n```\n\nThen open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nIf you have trouble compiling the client, please make sure you have the latest version of GopherJS installed by running `go get -u github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs` (see #6)\n\nFeedback\n--------\n\nFeel free to provide your feedback, suggestions or bug reports here in the <a href="https://github.com/iafan/goplayspace/issues">bug tracker</a>, or message [@afan](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/@afan/) in the [Gophers Slack channel](https://gophersinvite.herokuapp.com/).\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nGopher vector logo by [Takuya Ueda](https://twitter.com/tenntenn),\nlicensed under the Creative Commons 3.0 Attributions license and based\non original artwork by [Renee French](http://reneefrench.blogspot.com/).\nSee https://github.com/golang-samples/gopher-vector\n\nGo proverbs: [Rob Pike](https://twitter.com/rob_pike)\n'
