You can then pass down styles to customize it to your needs.\n\nFor Android, by default we are using the native Picker component. If you prefer, you can set `useNativeAndroidPickerStyle` to false, which will also render an unstyled TextInput component. You can then pass down styles to customize it to your needs.\n\nFor either platform, you can alternatively pass down a child element of your choice that will be wrapped in a touchable area.\n\n![iOS Example](./ex-ios.gif) ![Android Example](./ex-android.gif)\n\n## [View examples on snack.expo.io](https://snack.expo.io/@lfkwtz/react-native-picker-select)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installing\n\n`npm install react-native-picker-select`\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```js\nimport RNPickerSelect from \'react-native-picker-select\';\n\nexport const Dropdown = () => {\n    return (\n        <RNPickerSelect\n            onValueChange={(value) => console.log(value)}\n            items={[\n                { label: \'Football\', value: \'football\' },\n                { label: \'Baseball\', value: \'baseball\' },\n                { label: \'Hockey\', value: \'hockey\' },\n            ]}\n        />\n    );\n};\n```\n\n### Versioning\n\n| Component | React   |\n| --------- | ------- |\n| >= 3.0.0  | >= 16.3 |\n| < 3.0.0   | < 16.3  |\n\n### Props\n\n| Name                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Details                  |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |\n| `onValueChange`                                 | Callback which returns `value, index`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **required**<br>function |\n| `items`                                         | The items for the component to render<br> - Each item should be in the following format:<br>`{label: \'Orange\', value: \'orange\', key: \'orange\', color: \'orange\'}`<br>- The label and the value are required<br>- The key and color are optional<br>- The key will be set to the label if not included<br>- The value can be any data type                                                                                                                                                                | **required**<br>array    |\n| `placeholder`                                   | - An override for the default placeholder object with a label of `Select an item...` and a value of `null`<br>- An empty object can be used if you\'d like to disable the placeholder entirely                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | object                   |\n| `disabled`                                      | Disables interaction with the component                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | boolean                  |\n| `value`                                         | Will attempt to locate a matching item from the `items` array by checking each item\'s `value` property.

Examples of different styling options can be found [on the example snack](https://snack.expo.io/@lfkwtz/react-native-picker-select).\n\n#### iOS-specific\n\n-   The component wraps a TextInput without styling. You can target the TextInput styling with `inputIOS`.\n-   Other styles that can be modified for iOS are named `inputIOSContainer`, `placeholder`, `viewContainer`, `chevronContainer`, `chevron`, `chevronUp`, `chevronDown`, `chevronActive`, `done`, `modalViewTop`, `modalViewMiddle`, and `modalViewBottom`\n\n#### Android-specific\n\n-   The native Picker in its inactive state acts looks similar to a TextInput, but it has limitations on custom styling. Any styling that is possible can be applied via `inputAndroid`.\n-   You can add some styling customization to the active-state native Picker, [but that requires modifying some xml files](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39141949/1437023)\n-   If you set the prop `useNativeAndroidPickerStyle` to false, the component will allow a few other style objects: `inputAndroidContainer`, `placeholder`, and `inputAndroid`\n-   Other styles that can be modified for Android are named `headlessAndroidContainer` and `viewContainer`\n\n### Icon\n\n-   If a component is passed in via the `Icon` prop - it will be rendered with `{ position: \'absolute\', right: 0 }` applied to its wrapping container. You can modify these values and add additional spacing to position the icon as needed by modifying `iconContainer`. You\'ll probably also want to add some `paddingRight` to your input styling to avoid any longer text appearing behind the icon.\n-   You can pass a component of your choosing (css, image, svg, etc..) for use as the icon. For ease of use, consider a library such as [react-native-shapes](https://github.com/lfkwtz/react-native-shapes) or [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons).\n-   Examples of different icons and their usage can be found [on the example snack](https://snack.expo.io/@lfkwtz/react-native-picker-select).\n\n## Testing\n\nThis component has been tested on React Native v0.51 - v0.59\n\n[![BrowserStack](https://i.imgur.com/cOdhMed.png)](https://www.browserstack.com/)\n\n## License\n\nreact-native-picker-select is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/lawnstarter/react-native-picker-select/tree/master/LICENSE) and built with :heart: in Austin, TX by the team at [LawnStarter](https://lawnstarter.com)\n'
