It\'s easy to use, it has predefined logic for different situations and prevents common mistakes.<br/>\nThis library is configurable and it guides the developers to create a better user experience and now, even more with the new features.\n\n### Features in main library\n* Simple, Single & Multi selection mode.\n* Mapping multi-view types with [Item interfaces](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/wiki/5.x-%7C-Item-Interfaces).\n* Predefined [ViewHolders](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/wiki/5.x-%7C-ViewHolders) with (child) click listeners and others callbacks.\n* Async [Updates](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/wiki/5.x-%7C-Update-Data-Set) with optional _DiffUtil_ for small lists.\n* Async [Filter](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/wiki/5.x-%7C-Search-Filter) with spannable text (:eyeglasses:);

Works with expandable and swiped items too!\n* Basic empty view handling with [EmptyViewHelper](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/wiki/5.x-%7C-EmptyViewHelper).\n* [Advanced item decoration](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/wiki/5.x-%7C-Flexible-Item-Decoration) (customizable dividers, sections gap and item offsets).\n* 3 layout managers that support smooth scrolling.\n* [FlexibleUtils](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/wiki/5.x-%7C-Utils) for text highlighting, accent color fetching, API versions.\n* [DrawableUtils](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/wiki/5.x-%7C-Utils) for dynamic backgrounds with ripple effect (_No XML_).\n\n### Others _experimental_ extension libraries\n* [Live Data](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/wiki/Extensions-%7C-LiveData).\n* Data Binding.\n\n# Setup\n#### build.gradle\n```\nrepositories {\n    jcenter()\n}\n```\n```\ndependencies {\n    // Using JCenter\n    implementation \'eu.davidea:flexible-adapter:5.1.0\'\n    implementation \'eu.davidea:flexible-adapter-ui:1.0.0\'\n    implementation \'eu.davidea:flexible-adapter-livedata:1.0.0-b3\'\n    // From 1.0.0-b3, library is compiled with data binding v2\n    implementation \'eu.davidea:flexible-adapter-databinding:1.0.0\'\n}\n```\n#### Stay Updated\n|Flexible Adapter|UI|Live Data|Data Binding|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|<div align="center">5.1.0</div>|<div align="center">1.0.0</div>|<div align="center">1.0.0-b3</div>|<div align="center">1.0.0</div>|\n|<a href=\'https://bintray.com/davideas/maven/flexible-adapter?source=watch\' alt=\'Get automatic notifications about new "flexible-adapter" versions\'><img src=\'https://www.bintray.com/docs/images/bintray_badge_color.png\'></a>|<a href=\'https://bintray.com/davideas/maven/flexible-adapter-ui?source=watch\' alt=\'Get automatic notifications about new "flexible-adapter-ui" versions\'><img src=\'https://www.bintray.com/docs/images/bintray_badge_bw.png\'></a>|<a href=\'https://bintray.com/davideas/maven/flexible-adapter-livedata?source=watch\' alt=\'Get automatic notifications about new "flexible-adapter-livedata" versions\'><img src=\'https://www.bintray.com/docs/images/bintray_badge_bw.png\'></a>|<a href=\'https://bintray.com/davideas/maven/flexible-adapter-databinding?source=watch\' alt=\'Get automatic notifications about new "flexible-adapter-databinding" versions\'><img src=\'https://www.bintray.com/docs/images/bintray_badge_bw.png\'></a>|\n\n# Wiki!\nI strongly recommend to read the **[Wiki](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/wiki) pages**, where you can find a comprehensive Tutorial.<br/>\n\n### Pull requests / Issues / Improvement requests\nFeel free to contribute and ask!<br/>\nActive discussions:\n- [The next steps of development: New demoApp > Extensions](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/issues/361).\n\n### Under the hood\nSome simple features have been implemented, thanks to some Blogs (see at the bottom of the page), merged and methods have been improved for speed and scalability.\n\n<p align="center"><img src="./screenshots/wiki_diagram.png"></p>\n\n* At lower level there is `SelectableAdapter` class. It provides selection features and it\'s able to _maintain the state_ after the rotation: you just need to call the onSave/onRestore methods from the Activity!\n* At middle level, the `AnimatorAdapter` class has been added to give some animation at startup and when user scrolls.\n* At front level, the core class `FlexibleAdapter`. It holds and handles the main list, performs actions on all different types of item paying attention at the adding and removal of the items, as well as the new concept of "selection coherence".\n* Useful extensions and helpers have been added during the time to simplify the development.\n* Item interfaces and predefined ViewHolders complete the whole library giving more actions to the items and configuration options to developers.\n\n# Showcase of the demo App\nYou can [download](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/releases) the latest demo App from the latest release page OR run it with the emulator.<br>\nThis [Wiki page](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/wiki/5.x-%7C-Demo-App) will give you a short briefing of the demo App.\n\n![Overall](/screenshots/demo20_overall.png)\n![Adapter Animations](/screenshots/demo20_adapter_animations.png)\n![Undo](/screenshots/demo20_undo_single_selection.png)\n![Staggered Layout](/screenshots/demo20_dynamic_staggered_layout.png)\n\n![Endless](/screenshots/demo20_endless.png)\n![Instagram](/screenshots/demo20_instagram.png)\n![Expandables](/screenshots/demo20_expandables.png)\n![Multi Selection & SC](/screenshots/demo20_selection_coherence.png)\n\n![Drag & Drop](/screenshots/demo20_drag_linear.png)\n![swipe-to-dismiss1](/screenshots/demo20_swipe-to-dismiss1.png)\n![swipe-to-dismiss2](/screenshots/demo20_swipe-to-dismiss2.png)\n![ViewPager](/screenshots/demo20_view_pager.png)\n\n![Async Filter](/screenshots/demo20_async_filter.png)\n![Search Filter](/screenshots/demo20_search_filter.png)\n![Search Sections](/screenshots/demo20_search_sections.png)\n\n# Change Log\n###### Latest release\n[v5.1.0](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/releases/tag/5.1.0) - 2018.09.30\n\n###### Old releases\n[v5.0.6](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/releases/tag/5.0.6) - 2018.09.16 |\n[v5.0.5](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/releases/tag/5.0.5) - 2018.06.03 |\n[v5.0.4](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/releases/tag/5.0.4) - 2018.05.01 |\n[v5.0.3](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/releases/tag/5.0.3) - 2018.03.23 |\n[v5.0.2](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/releases/tag/5.0.2) - 2018.03.17 |\n[v5.0.1](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/releases/tag/5.0.1) - 2018.03.11 |\n[v5.0.0](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/releases/tag/5.0.0) - 2018.03.04\n\n# Limitations\nItem half swipe cannot be implemented due to how the `android.support.v7.widget.helper.ItemTouchHelper` is done, also clicks on rear view are not possible, same reason.\nHalf swipe can be done with others means, please see issues #98 and #100.
