Come on in, take your shoes\noff, stay a while\xe2\x80\x94_explore_ how Kickstarter\'s native squad has built and\ncontinues to build the app, _discover_ our implementation of [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) in logic-\nfilled [view models](https://github.com/kickstarter/android-oss/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/kickstarter/viewmodels),\nand maybe even _create_ an issue or two.\n\nWe\'ve also open sourced our iOS app, written in Swift:\n[check it out here](https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss). Read more about our journey to open source [here](https://kickstarter.engineering/open-sourcing-our-android-and-ios-apps-6891be909fcd#.o1fe86s6w).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n_Follow these instructions to build and run the project with mock data.._\n\n1.

[Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).\n4. `cd` into the project repo and run `make bootstrap` to bootstrap your Android\n   development environment.
