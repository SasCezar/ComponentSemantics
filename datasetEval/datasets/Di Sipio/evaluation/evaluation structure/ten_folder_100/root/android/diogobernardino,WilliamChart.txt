b'# williamchart ![phone][2]![watch][3]\n\n[![Kotlin Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-1.3.50-blue.svg)](https://kotlinlang.org)\n[![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-16%2B-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/api?level=16)\n[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/diogobernardino/williamchart/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/diogobernardino/williamchart)\n\nWilliamchart is an Android Library to rapidly implement attractive and insightful charts in android applications.\n\nNote: WilliamChart v3 has been completely re-written from scratch in Kotlin and does not guarantee any API/features compatibility with previous versions. Android development has been evolving quickly, and much has changed since I first started developing williamchart (e.g patterns, testing, tools), so I decided it was time to rewrite it with all these new tools in mind. I intend to keep it as light and modular as possible.\n\n![screenshot][4]\n\n### Gradle \n\n``` groovy\nimplementation \'com.diogobernardino:williamchart:3.1.1\'\n```\n\nIf you find this library useful and decide to use it in your projects please drop me a line [@dfbernardino][1], I will be happy to know about it.\n\n### Usage\n\n#### All charts\n\n```xml\n<com.db.williamchart.view.chart_view\n  ...\n  app:chart_labelsColor="color"\n  app:chart_labelsSize="dimension"\n  app:chart_labelsFont="font" \n/>\n```\n\n#### Line Chart\n\n```xml\n<com.db.williamchart.view.LinechartView\n  ...\n  app:chart_lineColor="color"\n  app:chart_lineThickness="dimension"\n  app:chart_smoothLine=[ "true" | "false" ]\n  app:chart_pointDrawable="drawable" \n/>\n```\n\n#### Bar Chart\n\n```xml\n<com.db.williamchart.view.BarChartView|HorizontalBarChartView\n  ...\n  app:chart_spacing="dimension"\n  app:chart_barsColor="color"\n  app:chart_barsBackgroundColor="color" ]\n  app:chart_barsRadius="dimension" \n/>\n```\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n    Copyright 2019 Diogo Bernardino\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n\n[1]: https://twitter.com/dfbernardino\n[2]: ./art/phone.png\n[3]: ./art/watch.png\n[4]: ./art/demo_screenshot.png'
