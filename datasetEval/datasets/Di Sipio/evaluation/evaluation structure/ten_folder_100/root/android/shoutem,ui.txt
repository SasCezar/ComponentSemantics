b'# Shoutem UI\n\nShoutem UI is a set of styleable components that enables you to build beautiful React Native applications for iOS and Android. All of our components are built to be both composable and [customizable](http://github.com/shoutem/theme). Each component has a predefined style that is compatible with the rest of the Shoutem UI, which makes it possible to build complex components that look great without the need to manually define complex styles.\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save @shoutem/ui\n$ react-native link # No need to run this with Create React Native App / Expo\n```\n\n## Docs\n\nAll the documentation is available on the [Developer portal](http://shoutem.github.io/docs/ui-toolkit/introduction).\n\n## Community\n\nJoin [our community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/shoutem.community/) on Facebook. Also, feel free to ask a question on Stack Overflow using ["shoutem" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/shoutem).\n\n## Examples\n\nTo see how Shoutem UI works, you can:\n\n- include the `Examples` component into your React Native app or\n- run `Restaurants` app in `examples` folder.\n\n### Examples component\n\n**If you are using Expo, see [this\nproject](https://github.com/shoutem/ui/blob/develop/examples/create-react-native-app/App.js)\nfor example usage. Otherwise, follow the steps below.**\n\nCreate new React Native project and locate to it:\n\n```bash\n$ react-native init HelloWorld && cd HelloWorld\n```\n\nInstall `@shoutem/ui` in your project:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install --save @shoutem/ui\n$ react-native link\n```\n\nNow, simply copy the following to your `App.js` files of the React Native project:\n\n```JavaScript\nimport React, { Component } from \'react\';\nimport { Examples } from \'@shoutem/ui\';\n\nexport default class App extends Component<{}> {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Examples />\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, run the app!\n\n```bash\n$ react-native run-ios\n```\n\nTo see other components, just import them from `@shoutem/ui` and render them.\n\nYou can also use standard React Native components in your layouts anywhere you want, but they will not inherit either the theme or the parent styles, so you will need to style them manually.\n\n\n### Restaurants app\n\nClone the [Shoutem UI](https://github.com/shoutem/ui) repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/shoutem/ui.git\n```\n\nLocate to `RestaurantsApp` folder:\n\n```bash\ncd ui/examples/RestaurantsApp\n```\n\nInstall and link dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nreact-native link\n```\n\nFinally, run the app!\n\n```bash\nreact-native run-ios\nreact-native run-android\n```\n\n## UI Toolkit\n\nShoutem UI is a part of the [Shoutem UI Toolkit](https://shoutem.github.io/ui/) that enables you to build professional looking React Native apps with ease.\n\nIt consists of three libraries:\n\n- [@shoutem/ui](https://github.com/shoutem/ui): beautiful and customizable UI components\n- [@shoutem/theme](https://github.com/shoutem/theme): \xe2\x80\x9cCSS-way\xe2\x80\x9d of styling entire app\n- [@shoutem/animation](https://github.com/shoutem/animation): declarative way of applying ready-made  animations\n\n## License\n\n[The BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\nCopyright (c) 2016-present, [Shoutem](http://shoutem.github.io)\n'
