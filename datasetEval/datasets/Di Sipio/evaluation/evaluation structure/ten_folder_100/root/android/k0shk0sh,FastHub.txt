But in <b>few</b> cases your GitHub account Oauth token will do the trick.</p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Why am I having problems editing Issues/PRs?</summary>\n  <p>If you are unable to edit an issue in a public organization, please contact your Organization Admin to grant access to FastHub. Alternatively you can login using an Access Token with the correct permissions granted.</p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>I\'m having this issue! / I want this and that!</summary>\n  <p>Head to https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub/issues/new and create new issue for bugs or feature requests.
