b'A Web Component statblock for D&D 5E\n====================================\n\nStatblock5e provides an easy way to display a creature statblock that looks\nalmost exactly like the statblocks from the 5th edition D&D Monster Manual.\n\n<div align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Valloric/statblock5e/gh-pages/images/statblock.png" />\n</div>\n\nThis is implemented as a set of custom elements following the [Web\nComponents][web-components] specs: [ES Modules][es-module], [Custom\nElements][custom-elements], and the [Shadow DOM][shadow-dom].\n\nWhile statblock5e has been tested the most in Chrome, it may also work in any browser that [properly implements the Web Components v1 specs][web-components]. **Make sure you are using _at least_ Chrome 61 or Firefox 63.**\n\n<div align="center">\n  <p><a href="http://valloric.github.io/statblock5e/demo.html">\n     <b>LIVE DEMO</b></a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n**There are _no_ dependencies** (JavaScript or otherwise), **this is entirely\nself-contained**.\n\nThere\'s very little JavaScript actually; just a bit of boilerplate that\ndefines the custom elements and some minor logic for computing the ability modifiers\nfor the ability table. Other than that, it\'s pure HTML, CSS & SVG.\n\nHere\'s the markup that produced the above picture. **No user-level CSS or\nJavaScript is necessary.**\n\n```html\n<stat-block>\n  <creature-heading>\n    <h1>Animated Armor</h1>\n    <h2>Medium construct, unaligned</h2>\n  </creature-heading>\n\n  <top-stats>\n    <property-line>\n      <h4>Armor Class</h4>\n      <p>18 (natural armor)</p>\n    </property-line>\n    <property-line>\n      <h4>Hit Points</h4>\n      <p>33 (6d8 + 6)</p>\n    </property-line>\n    <property-line>\n      <h4>Speed</h4>\n      <p>25ft</p>\n    </property-line>\n\n    <abilities-block data-str="14"\n                     data-dex="11"\n                     data-con="13"\n                     data-int="1"\n                     data-wis="3"\n                     data-cha="1"></abilities-block>\n\n    <property-line>\n      <h4>Damage Immunities</h4>\n      <p>poison, psychic</p>\n    </property-line>\n    <property-line>\n      <h4>Condition Immunities</h4>\n      <p>blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed,\n        petrified, poisoned</p>\n    </property-line>\n    <property-line>\n      <h4>Senses</h4>\n      <p>blindsight 60 ft.

The differences are:\n\n- **Different typefaces used.** I\'m told that the body typeface used in the MM\n  is _FF Scala Sans_ and the one used for the monster name headings is\n  _Mrs Eaves Petite Caps_. They\'re not available for free from Google Fonts, so\n  substitutes are used instead.\n- **No textured background.** Obviously, I don\'t have access to the original\n  textures WotC used. Even if I did, I\'m not sure I\'d use them since that would\n  mean serving images which I wanted to avoid (scaling/resolution/deployment\n  issues etc).\n- **No textured block border.** Same as above.\n\nThere are probably other differences as well but I haven\'t noticed them. I tried\nto stick as close to the original as reasonably possible; for instance, I spent\n_waaay_ too much time getting the drop-shadow to be the "correct" shade of\nbrown and the tapered horizontal rule to render _just_ right. _Why?_ Because I\nhad nothing better to do and it was fun! :)\n\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### Is there a single-file version?\n\nThe [`demo.html`][demo] file in the repository HTML-imports the other HTML\nsource files. There\'s also [`demo-inlined.html`][demo-inline] which renders\nexactly the same but has all the HTML-imports inlined directly into the\ndocument.\n\nThe Python script that produces the inlined version [is also\navailable][inline-script].\n\n### How do I make two-column layouts?\n\nSee the [`demo-two-column.html`][demo2c] file ([here\'s a rendered\nimage][2c-img]). The key thing to notice is the use of the `data-two-column`\nattribute on the `<stat-block>` element. You can also use the\n`data-content-height` attribute to tweak the layout. See [the\ncomments][2c-comment] in the demo file for details.\n\n### Why aren\'t you using polyfills?\n\nWhile polyfills for Web Components [do exist][platform], they\'re not perfect and\nrequire a preprocessing stage that inlines all HTML imports and rewrites the new\nCSS selectors like `:host`, `::content`, `/deep/` etc. There\'s no easy way to\ntie all this together and frankly, I don\'t care enough since I\'ll personally\nonly use this for locally hosted pages rendered in Chrome.\n\nIf someone wants to do the required work to implement the whole preprocessing\npipeline, pull requests are welcome.\n\nVersion History\n---------------\n\n### 0.0.5\n- Updated to the WebComponents v1 spec, since [several aspects of WebComponents v0 are being removed in Chrome 73][chrome-70-deprecations].\n  - Use ES Modules instead of HTML Imports.\n  - Use Custom Elements v1 instead of `registerElement()`.\n  - Use `createShadowRoot()` instead of `attachShadow()`.\n  - Use `<slot>` instead of `<content>`.\n- Define `data-content-height` as a CSS custom property instead of as an HTML attribute, so we don\'t have to use a javascript hack to set the height of the stat-block.\n- Rewrite `inline-imports.py` to parse the ES module and HTML template files.\n\n### 0.0.4\n- Fixed issue with text floating outside the statblock on Chrome 50+.\n\n### 0.0.3\n- Simpler way of supporting two-column layout.\n\n### 0.0.2\n- `<property-line>` can now be used for legendary actions since it doesn\'t\n  hardcode red text.\n- Support for two-column layout! See the new item in the FAQ.\n- Now supporting multiple `<p>` elements inside `<property-block>`. All `<p>`\'s\n  after the first will have an indent like in the MM.\n- Increasing h3 size to be closer to MM.\n- Increasing line height of body font to be closer to MM.\n- Using a new typeface for monster name heading. Should be closer to MM.\n- Slightly increased body font size to be closer to MM font metrics.\n\n### 0.0.1\n- Initial release.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis software is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0][apache2].\n\n[web-components]: http://webcomponents.org/\n[es-module]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#integration-with-the-javascript-module-system\n[custom-elements]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements\n[shadow-dom]: http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/\n[wotc-basic]: http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules?x=dnd/basicrules\n[dm-basic]: http://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/DMDnDBasicRules_v0.1.pdf\n[apache2]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\n[platform]: https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/platform.html\n[demo]: http://valloric.github.io/statblock5e/demo.html\n[demo2c]: http://valloric.github.io/statblock5e/demo-two-column.html\n[demo-inline]: http://valloric.github.io/statblock5e/demo-inlined.html\n[2c-img]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Valloric/statblock5e/gh-pages/images/statblock-2c.png\n[inline-script]: https://github.com/Valloric/statblock5e/blob/master/tools/inline-imports.py\n[2c-comment]: https://github.com/Valloric/statblock5e/blob/9c71e07d7a69aeb443ae9684dd3b73ef15a63f51/demo-two-column.html#L28\n[chrome-70-deprecations]: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/09/chrome-70-deps-rems'
