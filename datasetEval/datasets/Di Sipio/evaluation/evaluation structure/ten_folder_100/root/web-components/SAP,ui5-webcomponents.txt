They allow you to create a consistent user experience aligned to the [SAP Fiori Design Guidelines](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/) and incorporate the Fiori 3 design.\n\n## What are Web Components?\n\nWeb Components are a set of features which allow to enhance the HTML vocabulary with custom HTML elements when the standard HTML elements are not sufficient (for example, a Button with an icon or a DatePicker). The custom HTML elements allow to share those features and qualities in a standard way. The complexity of HTML, CSS and components behavior is encapsulated behind a custom HTML element. The interaction with the custom HTML elements is done using the standard DOM API.\n\n## What is UI5/OpenUI5?\n\n[OpenUI5](https://openui5.org/) is a JS framework that lets you build enterprise-ready web applications, responsive to all devices, running on almost any browser of your choice. It\'s based on JavaScript, using jQuery as its foundation and follows web standards. It eases your development with a client-side HTML5 rendering library including a rich set of controls and supports data binding to different data models (JSON, XML and OData).\n\n## Classification of UI5 Web Components\n\nUI5 Web Components\xe2\x80\xa6\n* \xe2\x80\xa6are **not built on top** of UI5, but rather lightweight and independent UI elements\n* \xe2\x80\xa6are **not a successor** of UI5, but rather a complementary offering\n* \xe2\x80\xa6bring the relevant **UI5 qualities and SAP Fiori UX to the HTML level**, usable with any web framework\n\nUI5 Web Components are good for\xe2\x80\xa6\n* \xe2\x80\xa6**static web sites** built without web frameworks, to just add a few interactive UI elements\n* \xe2\x80\xa6web applications which **already use a different web framework**\n\nUI5 remains what it is: the best choice for\xe2\x80\xa6\n* \xe2\x80\xa6building complete **enterprise-ready and responsive web applications**\n\n## Resources\n- [UI5 Web Components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents)\n- [UI5 Web Components - Playground and API Reference](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/)\n\n## Download and Installation\nTo consume UI5 Web Components, first you need to install the NPM module:\n\n```sh\nnpm install @ui5/webcomponents\n```\n\n...and optionally:\n\n```sh\nnpm install @ui5/webcomponents-fiori\n```\n\nfor some more specific Fiori UX components such as `ui5-shellbar`.\n\n\nImport the desired component(s) in your app to define the UI5 Web Component.\n\nFor example, to use ```ui5-button``` you need to import it:\n\n```js\nimport "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Button.js"; // loads ui5-button\n```\n\n...similarly to use ```ui5-shellbar```:\n\n```js\nimport "@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/ShellBar.js"; // loads ui5-shellbar\n```\n\nThen, you can use the custom element in an HTML page:\n\n```html\n<ui5-button>Hello world!</ui5-button>\n```\n\n*Note*: For a full list of the UI5 Web Components (and the respective NPM modules that ship them), click [here](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/blob/master/docs/Public%20Module%20Imports.md) \n\n## Browser support\n\nCurrently only Chrome, Safari and Firefox support Web Components natively.\n\nIf your application should run on browsers without native Web Components support (Edge and/or IE11), import one the following modules before your first Web Component import: \n\n### Edge only\n\n```js\nimport "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/browsersupport/Edge.js";\n```\n\n### Edge and IE11\n\n```js\nimport "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/browsersupport/IE11.js";\n```\n\n*Note:* Importing the module for IE11 support automatically enables Edge support as well, so there is no need to import them both explicitly.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/browsersupport/IE11.js"; // This will enable Edge and IE11 support for all Web Components below\nimport "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Button.js"; // loads ui5-button\nimport "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Label.js"; // loads ui5-label\n```\n\n## Configure\nUI5 Web Components have built-in internationalization and globalization support. Language, compact/cozy switch, date/time settings and theme can be changed with parameters.\n\nTo provide configuration settings, create a ```script``` tag having ```data-ui5-config``` and ```type="application/json"```:\n\n```html\n<script data-ui5-config type="application/json">\n{\n  "theme": "sap_belize",\n  "language": "EN"\n}\n</script>\n\n```\n\n### Configure RTL\nUI5 Web Components support right-to-left text direction (RTL). To enable RTL globally, provide the option ```rtl: true``` in the configuration ```script``` tag:\n\n```html\n<script data-ui5-config type="application/json">\n{\n  "language": "en",\n  "rtl": true\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n### Configure Compact/Cozy setting\nUI5 Web Components supports ```Compact``` and ```Cozy``` mode. It is set to ```Cozy``` by default. To enable ```Compact``` globally, provide the option ```compactSize: true``` in the configuration ```script``` tag:\n\n```html\n<script data-ui5-config type="application/json">\n{\n  "compactSize": true\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n### Configure Calendar Type\nUI5 Web Components support different calendar types (Gregorian, Islamic, Japanese, Buddhist and Persian). To change them, provide the option ```calendarType: "Islamic"``` in the configuration ```script``` tag:\n\n```html\n<script data-ui5-config type="application/json">\n{\n  "calendarType": "Islamic"\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n## Develop\n\n### Requirements\n- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en)\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (**version 8.5 or higher**)\n\nYou can clone the UI5 Web Components repository and start the Playground app with the following commands:\n\n```sh\nyarn # to install all dependencies\nyarn start # to serve the project\n```\nThis will open the Playground page in the browser!\n\n## Production Build\nTo build the UI5 Web Components, just run the following commands:\n\n```sh\nyarn # to install all dependecies\nyarn build # to build the project\n```\n\nAfterwards, you can find the static **UI5 Web Components - Playground** in the `dist` folder of the playground.\n\n## FAQ\n### What\'s the thing with Yarn?\nIn a couple of guides we refer to the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) node package manager. This is because it offers functionality that the otherwise preferred [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager is currently lacking. Namely, the [workspace](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) setting which is currently used in the [OpenUI5 (mono-)repository](https://github.com/SAP/openui5). Note that npm [might add](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15900#issuecomment-315335381) this feature in the future.\n\nKeep in mind that linking the same module with npm and Yarn may cause issues. Also, Yarn can\'t work with links created by npm and vice versa.\n\n### Where are the npm packages?\n- [UI5 Web Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/webcomponents)\n- [UI5 Web Components Fiori](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/webcomponents-fiori)\n- [UI5 Web Components Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/webcomponents-icons)\n- [UI5 Web Components Base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/webcomponents-base)\n- [UI5 Web Components Theme Base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/webcomponents-theme-base)\n- [UI5 Web Components Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/webcomponents-core)\n\n## Limitations\nNone as of 1.0.0-rc.5 \n\n## Known Issues\nNo major bugs known.\n\n## Support\nWe welcome all comments, suggestions, questions, and bug reports.
