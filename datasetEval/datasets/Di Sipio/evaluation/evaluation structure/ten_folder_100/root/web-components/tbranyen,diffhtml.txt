b'# <\xc2\xb1/> diffHTML\n\n*A suite of JavaScript user interface tooling, built for the web.*\n\nStable version: 1.0.0-beta.9\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tbranyen/diffhtml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tbranyen/diffhtml)\n[![Coverage\n  Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/tbranyen/diffhtml/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/tbranyen/diffhtml?branch=master) \n\ndiffHTML is a library that assists with creating user interfaces using\nJavaScript. These interfaces can be: applications, games, data visualizations,\nor anything else that you may want to render in a web browser.\n\nThis repository is a mono-repo structured with the [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/)\nCLI tool. This makes it easier to support continuous integration, consistent\nversioning, and working on the various diffHTML tools.\n\n[**Click here to go directly to the diffHTML library source**](/packages/diffhtml/)\n\n## Features\n\n- Parses real **HTML** and supports **JSX & Tagged Templates**.\n- Efficient minimal rendering that utilizes **object pooling**.\n- **Web** and **React**-compatible stateful components.\n- View and debug your code using the **Chrome DevTools extension**.\n- **Transition hooks** monitor DOM changes an are similar to mutation events.\n- Powerful **middleware** extends diffHTML with additional features.\n\n## Packages\n\nThe following list of packages are nested in the `/packages` folder. They can\nbe tested globally or independently by using `npm test` at the root directory\nlevel or any specific nested package level.\n\n* **[diffhtml](/packages/diffhtml)**\n\n  ``` sh\n  npm install diffhtml\n  ```\n\n  The core library for creating user interfaces. Contains a full build and\n  smaller runtime build (which excludes HTML parser, tagged templates, and\n  performance metrics).\n\n* **[diffhtml-components](/packages/diffhtml-components)**\n\n  ``` sh\n  npm install diffhtml-components\n  ```\n\n  Provides stateful React-like and v1 Web Component classes with a consistent\n  API. If you\'re looking for drop-in React parity, refer to the\n  [diffhtml-react-compat](/packages/diffhtml-react-compat) package.\n\n* **[diffhtml-render-to-string](/packages/diffhtml-render-to-string)**\n\n  ``` sh\n  npm install diffhtml-render-to-string\n  ```\n\n  Use with diffHTML to render your Virtual Trees to strings. This is useful for\n  server-side rendering and testing.\n\n* **[babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml](/packages/babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml)**\n\n  ``` sh\n  npm install babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml\n  ```\n\n  Converts HTML found in tagged template strings to `createTree` calls and\n  allows you to shave bytes off your bundles by switching to the\n  diffHTML runtime build.\n\n* [diffhtml-middleware-logger](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-logger)\n\n  ``` sh\n  npm install diffhtml-middleware-logger\n  ```\n\n  Logs out diffHTML state from the start and end of every render transaction.\n\n* [diffhtml-middleware-synthetic-events](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-synthetic-events)\n\n  ``` sh\n  npm install diffhtml-middleware-synthetic-events\n  ```\n\n  Changes the event binding from inline event handlers like `onclick = fn` to\n  use `addEventListener`. Events are attached to the `body` element and\n  coordinated to children through delegation.\n\n* [diffhtml-middleware-inline-transitions](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-inline-transitions)\n\n  ``` sh\n  npm install diffhtml-middleware-inline-transitions\n  ```\n\n  By default diffHTML provides transition hooks at a global level. This\n  middleware turns them into scoped, performant, event hooks.\n\n* [diffhtml-middleware-verify-state](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-verify-state)\n\n  ``` sh\n  npm install diffhtml-middleware-verify-state\n  ```\n\n  Asserts that a render properly updated the old Virtual Tree and the DOM. Will\n  recursively search for inconsistencies, displays warnings unless debugging is\n  enabled, then it throws errors instead.\n\n* [diffhtml-middleware-service-worker](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-service-worker)\n\n  ``` sh\n  npm install diffhtml-middleware-service-worker\n  ```\n\n  Helps with the creation of a service worker for PWAs, available as a\n  convenience to make development more friendlier.\n\n* [diffhtml-react-compat](/packages/diffhtml-react-compat)\n\n  ```\n  npm install diffhtml-react-compat\n  ```\n\n  This is a compatibility package meant to be a drop-in replacement for the\n  modules: `react` and `react-dom`. It wraps the [diffHTML\n  Components](/packages/diffhtml-components) package as the base for the\n  component constructors. It then layers additional React-specific APIs.\n\n* [diffhtml-static-sync](/packages/diffhtml-static-sync)\n\n  ```\n  npm install diffhtml-static-sync\n  ```\n\n  A work-in-progress static HTML server that automatically reloads your markup\n  as you save using Web Sockets.\n\n* [diffhtml-devtools](/packages/diffhtml-devtools)\n\n  A work-in-progress set of developer tools that logs out transactions.\n  Eventually will allow for subscription/unsubscription of middleware, charting\n  for the overall application health, and more.\n\n* [diffhtml-website](/packages/diffhtml-website)\n\n  The source for the [www.diffhtml.org](https://www.diffhtml.org) website,\n  powered by: [Node](https://nodejs.com/) and [NodeGit](http://nodegit.org).\n\n## Contributors\n\n| [<img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/181635?v=4" width="100px;"/><br /><sub>Tim Branyen</sub>](https://tbranyen.com)<br />[\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb](https://github.com/tbranyen/diffhtml/commits?author=tbranyen "Code") | [<img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4371429?v=4" width="100px;"/><br /><sub>James DiGioia</sub>](http://jamesdigioia.com)<br />[\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb](https://github.com/tbranyen/diffhtml/commits?author=mAAdhaTTah "Code") |\n|:---:|:---:|\n'
