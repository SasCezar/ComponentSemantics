Our goal is to make it _incredibly simple_ to create 2D HTML/JS games, for folks new to game development as well as experienced game developers. We take care of all of the boilerplate engine code, cross-platform targeting (using [browserstack](http://browserstack.com/) \xf0\x9f\x98\x8e), and more so you don\'t have to. Use as much or as little as you need!\n\nExcalibur is an open source project licensed under the 2-clause BSD license (this means you can use it in commercial projects!). It\'s free and always will be. We welcome any feedback or contributions!
