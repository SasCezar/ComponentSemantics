Below is the recommended system for running the simulator at high quality. We are currently working on performance improvements for a better experience. \n\n**Recommended system:**\n\n- 4 GHz Quad Core CPU\n- Nvidia GTX 1080, 8GB GPU memory\n- Windows 10 64 Bit\n\nThe easiest way to get started with running the simulator is to download our [latest release](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases/latest) and run as a standalone executable.\n\nFor the latest functionality or if you want to modify the simulator for your own needs, you can checkout our source, open it as a project in Unity, and run inside the Unity Editor. Otherwise, you can build the Unity project into a standalone executable.\n\nCurrently, running the simulator in Windows yields better performance than running on Linux. \n\n### Downloading and starting simulator\n\n1. Download the latest release of the LGSVL Simulator for your supported operating system (Windows or Linux) here: [https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases/latest](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases/latest)\n2. Unzip the downloaded folder and run the executable.\n\n### Building and running from source\n\n**NOTE**: to clone repository faster, clone only single branch:\n\n    git clone --single-branch https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator.git\n\nCheck out our instructions for getting started with building from source [here](Docs/docs/build-instructions.md).\n\n\n## Simulator Instructions\n\n1. After starting the simulator, you should see a button to open the UI in the browser. \n2. Go to the Simulations tab and select the appropriate map and vehicle.  For a standard setup, select "BorregasAve" for map and "Jaguar2015XE (Apollo 5.0)" for vehicle. Click "Run" to begin.\n3. The vehicle/robot should spawn inside the map environment that was selected. Read [here](Docs/docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md) for an explanation of all current keyboard shortcuts and controls.\n4. Follow the guides on our respective [Autoware](https://github.com/lgsvl/Autoware) and [Apollo 5.0](https://github.com/lgsvl/apollo-5.0) repositories for instructions on running the platforms with the simulator.\n\n[![](Docs/docs/images/readme-simulator.png)](Docs/docs/images/full_size_images/readme-simulator.png)\n\n### Guide to simulator functionality\n\nLook [here](Docs/docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md) for a guide to currently available functionality and keyboard shortcuts for using the simulator.\n\n\n\n## Contact\n\nPlease feel free to provide feedback or ask questions by creating a Github issue.
