b'# EasyRPG Player\n\nEasyRPG Player is a game interpreter to play RPG Maker 2000, 2003 and EasyRPG\ngames. It uses the LCF parser library (liblcf) to read RPG Maker game data.\n\nEasyRPG Player is part of the EasyRPG Project. More information is\navailable at the project website: https://easyrpg.org/\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is available at the documentation wiki: https://wiki.easyrpg.org\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n### minimal / required\n\n- [liblcf] for RPG Maker data reading.\n- SDL2 for screen backend support.\n- Pixman for low level pixel manipulation.\n- libpng for PNG image support.\n- zlib for XYZ image support.\n\n### extended / recommended\n\n- FreeType2 for external font support (+ HarfBuzz for Unicode text shaping)\n- mpg123 for better MP3 audio support\n- WildMIDI for better MIDI audio support\n- Libvorbis / Tremor for Ogg Vorbis audio support\n- opusfile for Opus audio support\n- libsndfile for better WAVE audio support\n- libxmp for better tracker music support\n- SpeexDSP for proper audio resampling\n- SDL2_mixer for audio mixing. Used as a fallback when none of the provided\n  audio libraries support the format. Due to API limitations not all audio\n  effects are possible through SDL2_mixer audio.\n\nSDL 1.2 and SDL_mixer 1.2 are still supported, but deprecated.\n\n\n## Daily builds\n\nUp to date binaries for assorted platforms are available at our continuous\nintegration service:\n\nhttps://ci.easyrpg.org/view/Player/\n\n\n## Source code\n\nEasyRPG Player development is hosted by GitHub, project files are available\nin this git repository:\n\nhttps://github.com/EasyRPG/Player\n\nReleased versions are also available at our Download Archive:\n\nhttps://easyrpg.org/downloads/player/\n\n\n## Building\n\n### Autotools Makefile method:\n\nBuilding requirements:\n\n- pkg-config\n- GNU make\n\nStep-by-step instructions:\n\n    tar xf easyrpg-player-0.6.1.tar.xz # unpack the tarball\n    cd easyrpg-player-0.6.1            # enter in the package directory\n    ./configure                        # find libraries, set options\n    make                               # compile the executable\n\nAdditional building requirements when using the source tree (git):\n\n- autoconf >= 2.69\n- automake >= 1.11.4\n- libtool\n\nTo generate the "configure" script, run before following the above section:\n\n    autoreconf -i\n\nRead more detailed instructions at:\n\nhttps://wiki.easyrpg.org/development/compiling/player/autotools\n\n\n### CMake method:\n\nBuilding requirements:\n\n- pkg-config (only on Linux)\n- CMake 3.7 or newer\n\nStep-by-step instructions:\n\n    tar xf easyrpg-player-0.6.1.tar.xz    # unpack the tarball\n    cd easyrpg-player-0.6.1               # enter in the package directory\n    cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release    # configure project\n    cmake --build .                       # compile the executable\n    sudo cmake --build . --target install # install system-wide\n\nRead more detailed instructions at:\n\nhttps://wiki.easyrpg.org/development/compiling/player/cmake\n\nCMake is the only supported way to build liblcf for Windows. All dependencies\nmust be installed with [vcpkg].\n\n### Building a libretro core:\n\nBuilding for libretro is based on the CMake method.\n\nAdditional commands required before building:\n\n    git submodule init   # Init submodules\n    git submodule update # Clone libretro-common submodule\n\nInvoke CMake with these additional parameters:\n\n    cmake . -DPLAYER_TARGET_PLATFORM=libretro -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON|OFF\n\nSet shared libs to ON or OFF depending on which type of libraries RetroArch\nuses on the platform you are targeting.\n\n\n## Running EasyRPG Player\n\nRun the `easyrpg-player` executable from a RPG Maker 2000 or 2003 game\nproject folder (same place as `RPG_RT.exe`).\n\n\n## Bug reporting\n\nAvailable options:\n\n* File an issue at https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player/issues\n* Open a thread at https://community.easyrpg.org/\n* Chat with us via IRC: [#easyrpg at irc.freenode.net]\n\n\n## License\n\nEasyRPG Player is free software available under the GPLv3 license.
