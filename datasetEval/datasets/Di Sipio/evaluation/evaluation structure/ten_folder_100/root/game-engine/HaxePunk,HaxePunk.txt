Then execute the following commands below to get started with your first HaxePunk project.\nIf you are using Haxe 2 the last version supporting it was [v2.3.0](https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk/releases/tag/v2.3.0) `haxelib install HaxePunk 2.3.0`.\n\n```bash\nhaxelib install HaxePunk\nhaxelib run HaxePunk setup\nhaxelib run HaxePunk new MyProject # creates a new project\n```\n\n## Development build\n\nYou will need a C++ compiler for native builds (Xcode, Visual Studio, g++).\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk.git\nmake\n```\n\nThis will build documentation, run unit tests, and run the example project. If you fix an issue, feel free to create a pull request.\n\nIf you\'ve cloned locally, you can set your local repo as a development directory accessible through Haxelib:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk.git\nhaxelib dev HaxePunk HaxePunk/\n```\n\nTo disable the dev directory for HaxePunk simply run the command `haxelib dev HaxePunk`. Notice there is no third argument passed.\n\nIf you just want to install the latest dev version from Git, you can also do this with haxelib:\n\n```bash\nhaxelib git HaxePunk https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk.git dev\n```\n\n## Have questions or looking to get involved?\n\nThere are a few ways you can get involved with HaxePunk.\n\n* The development roadmap is available on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/WZrfACWS/haxepunk-development).\n* Come chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/j6GeNwq) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/HaxePunk/HaxePunk).\n* Drop by the [HaxePunk forum](http://forum.haxepunk.com) to ask a question or show off what you\'ve created.\n* Create an issue or pull request or take part in the discussion.\n* Follow us on Twitter: [@HaxePunk](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=HaxePunk)\n\n## Credits\n\n* Chevy Ray Johnston for creating the original FlashPunk.\n* [OpenFL](http://www.openfl.org/) makes native targets possible and simplifies asset management. Thanks guys!\n* All the awesome people who have [contributed](https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk/graphs/contributors) to HaxePunk and joined in the discussions on the [forum](http://forum.haxepunk.com).\n\n## MIT License\n\nCopyright (C) 2012-2017 HaxePunk contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
