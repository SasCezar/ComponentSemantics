You need to own GTA in order to play it.\n\n\n## Download\n\nDownload it for [Windows](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/releases/download/v3.2/SanAndreasUnity-3.2-windows.zip), [Linux](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/releases/download/v3.2.1/SanAndreasUnity-3.2.1-linux.zip), [Android](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/wiki/Running-on-Android) or [Linux server](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/releases/download/v3.0/SanAndreasUnity-3.0-linuxserver.zip).\n\nThe game is tested on Linux, Windows, Mac, and Android. It supports both Mono and IL2CPP scripting backends, so it can be built for any platform that Unity supports, provided that you can copy PC version of GTASA to target device.\n\n\n## Multiplayer\n\nGame fully works in multiplayer. You can start the game as dedicated server, as a host (server & client at the same time), or you can connect to a server. This works on all supported platforms, which means you can start a host even on Android device.\n\nCurrently, the game doesn\'t have things like client-side prediction.\n\nIf you want to run a dedicated server, take a look at these [instructions](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/wiki/Command-line).\n\n\n## Development setup\n\n- clone the project, including submodules: `git clone --depth 1 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity`\n- open the project with Unity 2018.3\n- open startup scene located at Assets/Scenes/Startup.unity\n- press Play button\n\n\n## In-game controls\n\nPress Escape while in game to open pause menu. You\'ll see there a lot of utilities, and among them, there is a window which shows all controls.\n\n## TODO list\n\nHere is an extensive list of [what should be implemented](/Docs/TODO.md).\n\nCan help us to develop this ? In that case, join us on discord so we can discuss about it.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/557828/24571348/d964f098-1670-11e7-8759-0160dbf5bcb5.png)\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/557828/24571349/d96b7c24-1670-11e7-997d-ae15913481f8.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HX978mr.png)\n\n## Videos\n\n###\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/PItR-0FF7JI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PItR-0FF7JI)\n\n###\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/-3GAjTSLUUg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GAjTSLUUg)\n\n###\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/GMxJ6u3Jbak/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMxJ6u3Jbak)\n\n###\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/4DpdcawFjG4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DpdcawFjG4)\n\n\n'
