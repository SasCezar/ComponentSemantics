b"# Xash3D FWGS Engine [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FWGS/xash3d.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/FWGS/xash3d) [![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/FWGS/xash3d?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/a1batross/xash3d)\n\nLatest version of the engine is available at:\nhttps://github.com/FWGS/xash3d\n\nOrignal project: [Xash3D on ModDB](http://www.moddb.com/engines/xash3d-engine)\n\nXash3D Engine is a custom Gold Source engine rewritten from scratch. Xash3D\nis compatible with many of the Gold Source games and mods and should be\nable to run almost any existing singleplayer Half-Life mod without a hitch.\nThe multiplayer part is not yet completed, multiplayer mods should work just\nfine, but bear in mind that some features may not work at all or work not\nexactly the way they do in Gold Source Engine.\n\nXash3D FWGS is a fork of Xash3D Engine, which aims on crossplatform and compatibility\nwith original Xash3D and Gold Source.\n\n- [Building and running Xash3D FWGS](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d/wiki/Building-and-running)\n- [Installing and setting up the server on Debian/Ubuntu Linux](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d/wiki/How-to-set-up-a-Xash3D-Dedicated-Server-on-Debian-Ubuntu-Linux)\n\n# License\n\nThe library is licensed under GPLv3 license, see [COPYING](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d/blob/master/COPYING) for details.\nCMakeLists.txt files are licensed under MIT license, you will find it's text\nin every CMakeLists.txt header.\n"
