b'# ABOUT\n\n_dhewm 3_ is a _Doom 3_ GPL source port, known to work on at least Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD.\n\nThe goal of _dhewm 3_ is bring _DOOM 3_ with the help of SDL to all suitable\nplatforms.\n\nBugs present in the original _DOOM 3_ will be fixed (when identified) without\naltering the original gameplay.\n\n**The official homepage is:** https://dhewm3.org\n\n**Mods supported by dhewm3:** https://dhewm3.org/mods.html\n\n**Mod SDK for dhewm3:**  https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3-sdk\n\n**The project is hosted at:** https://github.com/dhewm\n\n**Download the latest release:** https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3/releases/latest\n\n**Consult the FAQ at:** https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3/wiki/FAQ\n\n**Report bugs here:** https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3/issues\n\n\n# CHANGES\n\nCompared to the original _DOOM 3_, the changes of _dhewm 3_ worth mentioning are:\n\n- 64-bit port\n- SDL for low-level OS support, OpenGL and input handling\n- OpenAL for audio output, all OS-specific audio backends are gone\n- OpenAL EFX for EAX reverb effects (read: EAX-like sound effects on all platforms/hardware)\n- Better support for widescreen (and arbitrary display resolutions)\n- A portable build system based on CMake\n- (Cross-)compilation with MinGW-w64\n\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n\n## Game data and patching\n\nThis source release does not contain any game data, the game data is still\ncovered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.\n\nYou must patch the game to the latest version (1.3.1). See the FAQ for details, including\nhow to get the game data from Steam on Linux or OSX.\n\nNote that _Doom 3_ and _Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil_ are available from the Steam Store at\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/9050/\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/9070/\n\nYou can also buy Steam keys at the Humble Store:\n\nhttps://www.humblebundle.com/store/p/doom3_storefront\n\nhttps://www.humblebundle.com/store/p/doom3_resofevil_storefront\n\nNote that neither Steam nor the Humble Store offer the *Resurrection of Evil* addon\nfor German customers (or at least people with German IP adresses).\n\n## Compiling\n\nThe build system is based on CMake: http://cmake.org/\n\nRequired libraries are not part of the tree. These are:\n\n- zlib\n- libjpeg (v8)\n- libogg\n- libvorbis\n- libvorbisfile (may be part of libvorbis)\n- OpenAL (OpenAL Soft required, Creative\'s and Apple\'s versions are made of fail)\n- SDL v1.2 or 2.0 (2.0 recommended)\n- libcurl (optional, required for server downloads)\n\nFor UNIX-like systems, these libraries need to be installed (including the\ndeveloper files). It is recommended to use the software management tools of\nyour OS (apt, dnf, portage, BSD ports, [Homebrew for macOS](http://brew.sh), ...).\n\nFor Windows, there are two options:\n\n- Use the provided binaries (recommended, see below)\n- Compile these libraries yourself\n\nCreate a distinct build folder outside of this source repository and issue\nthe cmake command there, pointing it at the neo/ folder from this repository:\n\n`cmake /path/to/repository/neo`\n\nmacOS users need to point CMake at OpenAL Soft (better solutions welcome):\n\n`cmake -DOPENAL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/openal-soft/lib/libopenal.dylib -DOPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openal-soft/include /path/to/repository/neo`\n\n## Using the provided Windows binaries\n\nGet a clone of the latest binaries here: https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3-libs\n\nThere are two subfolders:\n\n- 32-bit binaries are located in `i686-w64-mingw32`\n- 64-bit binaries are located in `x86_64-w64-mingw32`\n\nIssue the appropriate command from the build folder, for example:\n\n`cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" -DDHEWM3LIBS=/path/to/dhewm3-libs/i686-w64-mingw32 /path/to/repository/neo`\n\n`cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DDHEWM3LIBS=/path/to/dhewm3-libs/x86_64-w64-mingw32 /path/to/repository/neo`\n\nThe binaries are compatible with MinGW-w64 and all MSVC versions.\n\n## Cross-compiling\n\nFor cross-compiling, a CMake Toolchain file is required.\n\nFor the MinGW-w64 toolchain `i686-w64-mingw32` on Ubuntu 12.04, it looks like:\n\n```\nset(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)\nset(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR i686)\n\nset(CMAKE_C_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-gcc)\nset(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-g++)\nset(CMAKE_RC_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-windres)\n\nset(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH /usr/i686-w64-mingw32)\n\nset(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)\nset(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)\nset(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)\n```\n\nThen point CMake at your toolchain file:\n`cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/Toolchain.cmake -DDHEWM3LIBS=/path/to/dhewm3-libs/i686-w64-mingw32 /path/to/repository/neo`\n\n## Back End Rendering of Stencil Shadows\n\nThe Doom 3 GPL source code release does not include functionality enabling rendering\nof stencil shadows via the "depth fail" method, a functionality commonly known as\n"Carmack\'s Reverse".\n\n***Note*** that this **does *not* change the visual appereance** of the game.\nThe shadows look the same, they\'re just created in a slightly different way.\nIn theory there might be a small performance impact, but on hardware less than\nten years old it shouldn\'t make a difference.\n\n## MayaImport\n\nThe code for our Maya export plugin is included, if you are a Maya licensee\nyou can obtain the SDK from Autodesk.\n\n\n# LICENSE\n\nSee COPYING.txt for the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS:  The Doom 3 GPL Source Code is also subject to certain additional terms.
