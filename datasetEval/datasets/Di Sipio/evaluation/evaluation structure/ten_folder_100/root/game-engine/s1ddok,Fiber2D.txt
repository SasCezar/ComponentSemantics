As I stopped commiting to the repo since June, because Obj-C is dead for me. \n\nThis is still in a very **alpha state**, but you already can build some games with it, even though it may be unpleasant process as I change API almost every day. The project served as `.dylib` (`.so` on `Linux`/`Android`) that builds by Swift Package Manager. It requires some project config in order to use it, but you can experiment with the demo provided in the repo.\n*Generally the project should be considered unstable and most of the API is likely to be changed.*\n\n## Basement \nWe worked hard before starting this project and it relies on several self-made libs we made:\n* [SwiftMath](https://github.com/SwiftGFX/SwiftMath) ([@s1ddok](https://github.com/s1ddok), [@stuartcarnie](https://github.com/stuartcarnie))\n* [SwiftBGFX](https://github.com/SwiftGFX/SwiftBGFX) ([@stuartcarnie](https://github.com/stuartcarnie))\n\nThanks to them we currently have:\n* Ultra fast cross-platform math lib, that works with `SIMD` on `Darwin` platforms and has self-implemnted algorithms to run on `Glibc` based environment. Not speaking of **zero ARC** impact and modern swifty syntax features.\n* Modern agnostic renderer, which works with following list of backends **out of the box**:\n  * Direct3D 9, 11, 12\n  * Metal\n  * OpenGL 2.1, 3.1+, ES 2, ES 3.1\n  * WebGL 1.0, 2.0\n\n### What it looks like?\nCurrently this repo only contains demos for `Linux`, `Android`, `iOS` and `macOS`. `macOS` demo can use both `MetalKit` and `SDL`. `iOS` demo only supports `MetalKit` for now and can be easily ported to `tvOS`. `Linux` and `Android` demos can only be compiled with `SDL`, hence only `GL` rendering backend is available.\n\nYou can get the idea from this GIF: \n![Fiber2D Demo Gif](http://imgur.com/CP6d9kT.gif)\n\n# Goals (updated 29 DEC 2016)\nMy goals for the near future are (order means nothing):\n\n* **Port to `Windows`**\n* Introduce basic `UI components` (Button, Slider, Label)\n* Introduce GPU computed `Particle systems` \n* **Drop the concept of `contentScale` and use `one set of assets` for all screen resolutions**\n* Add support for more asset format loading from `.jpg` to `.pvr`\n* **Add easy post-processing mechanism**\n\nWe have a [trello](https://trello.com/b/eUe8CkrW/fiber2d) which I will try to maintain soon.\n\n# Build\n## macOS\n1. Clone\n\n   ```$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/s1ddok/Fiber2D.git```\n\n2. Call helper script, that will do all the preparation stuff for you.\n\n   ```\n   cd external/SwiftBGFX/3rdparty/bgfx\n   make osx-debug64 \n   ```\n\n3. Generate XCode project\n\n   ```\n   cd ../../../../\n   make xcodeproj-macos\n   ```\n\n4. Open XCode project, compile and run. You should see the demo yourself.\n\n## iOS\n\n1. Clone, build `bgfx` for `iOS`\n2. ``` make xcodeproj-ios ```\n3. Open demo XCode project, drag `Fiber2D-iOS.xcodeproj` somewhere in `System/iOS` group (just for reasonable structure).\n4. Go to `Project Settings` -> `Fiber2D-demo-iOS Target settings`. Add all frameworks from `Fiber2D-iOS` to `Embedded binaries`:\n![Embedded binaries example](https://i.gyazo.com/9be53aecedc25126a891d26554695c5a.png)\nDouble check that the same binaries appear in `Target dependencies` section of `Build Phases`.\n5. Compile and run\n\n# Contributors \n\n* [@stuartcarnie](https://github.com/stuartcarnie) did initial setup of the bgfx renderer along with general support on how to use it\n* [@gonzalolarralde](https://github.com/gonzalolarralde) helped with Android port of libDispatch/libFoundation and Fiber2D itself.\n\n# Questions\n\nYou can reach me on twitter ([@s1ddok](https://twitter.com/s1ddok)) or by e-mail in my profile.\n\n# LICENSE (BSD 2-clause)\n\nAll parts in this package (Fiber2D, SwiftMath, SwiftBGFX and bgfx itself) use the same license. \n\nCopyright 2016 Andrey Volodin.
