However, the following things should be taken into consideration:\n* We want to keep the game as close as possible to the vanilla game, so instead of introducing new gameplay features,\n  consider adding non-gameplay features, fixing bugs, improving performance and code quality\n* Major changes should be discussed before implementation\n* Follow the [procedures](doc/procedure)\n\nBe advised that this project is not sanctioned by GSC Game World in any way \xe2\x80\x93 and they remain the copyright holders\nof all the original source code.\n'
