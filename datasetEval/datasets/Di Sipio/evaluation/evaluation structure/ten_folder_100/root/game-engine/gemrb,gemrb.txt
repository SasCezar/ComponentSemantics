It sports a cleaner design, greater\nextensibility and several innovations.\nWould you like to create a game like Baldur's Gate?\n\nTo try it out you either need some of the ORIGINAL game's data or you can\nget a tiny sneak peek by running the included trivial game demo.\n\nThe original game data has to be installed if you want to see anything but\nthe included trivial demo. On non-windows systems either copy it over from\na windows install, use a compatible installer, WINE or extract it manually\nfrom the CDs using the unshield tool.\n\nDocumentation can be found converted on the [website](http://www.gemrb.org/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation), \nwhile the sources are in gemrb/docs/en/ and the \n[gemrb.6 man page](http://www.gemrb.org/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:manpage).\n\nIf you want to help out, start by reading this\nlist of [options, tips and priorities](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Supported platforms\n\nArchitectures and platforms that successfully run or ran GemRB:\n* Linux x86, x86-64, ppc, mips (s390x builds, but no running info)\n* FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD\n* MS Windows\n* various Macintosh systems (even pre x86)\n* some smart phones (Symbian, Android, other Linux-based, iOS)\n* some consoles (OpenPandora, Dingoo)\n* some exotic OSes (ReactOS, SyllableOS, Haiku, AmigaOS)\n\nIf you have something to add to the list or if an entry doesn't work any more, do let us know!\n\ng++ 4.3 is known to miscompile gemrb.\n\n## Requirements\n\nSee the INSTALL [file](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/blob/master/INSTALL).\n\n## Contacts\n\nThere are several ways you can get in touch:\n* [Homepage](http://gemrb.org)\n* [GemRB forum](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/91-gemrb/)\n* [IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=GemRB), #GemRB on the FreeNode IRC network\n* [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/64rEVAk) (Gibberlings3 server)\n* [Bug tracker](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/issues/new/choose)\n\n\n## Useful links\n\nOriginal engine research and data manipulation software:\n* [IESDP](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/), documentation for the Infinity Engine file formats and more\n* [Near Infinity](https://github.com/NearInfinityBrowser/NearInfinity/wiki), Java viewer and editor for data files\n* [DLTCEP](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/137-dltcep/), MS Windows viewer and editor for data files\n* [iesh](https://github.com/gemrb/iesh), IE python library and shell (for exploring data files)\n\nTools that can help with data installation:\n* [WINE](http://www.winehq.org), Open Source implementation of the Windows API, useful for installing the games\n* [Unshield](http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/unshield.php), extractor for .CAB files created by InstallShield\n"
