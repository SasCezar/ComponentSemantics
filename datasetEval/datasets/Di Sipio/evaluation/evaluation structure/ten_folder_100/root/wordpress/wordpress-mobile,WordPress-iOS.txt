b'# WordPress for iOS #\n\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS)\n[![Reviewed by Hound](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reviewed_by-Hound-8E64B0.svg)](https://houndci.com)\n\n## Build Instructions\n\nPlease refer to the sections below for more detailed information.\n\n1. [Download](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action) and install Xcode. *WordPress for iOS* requires Xcode 10.2 or newer.\n1. `git clone git@github.com:wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS.git` in the folder of your preference.\n1. `cd WordPress-iOS` to enter the working directory.\n1. `rake dependencies` to install all dependencies required to run the project (this may take some time to complete).\n1. `rake xcode` to open the project in Xcode. \n1. Compile and run the app on a device or an simulator.\n\nIn order to login to WordPress.com using the app:\n\n1. Create a WordPress.com account at https://wordpress.com/start/user (if you don\'t already have one).\n1. Create an application at https://developer.wordpress.com/apps/.\n1. Set "Redirect URLs"= `https://localhost` and "Type" = `Native` and click "Create" then "Update".\n1. Copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the OAuth Information. \n1. `cp WordPress/Credentials/wpcom_app_credentials-example .configure-files/wpcom_app_credentials` to copy the sample credentials file to your home folder.\n1. Paste `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the app you created into `WPCOM_APP_ID` and `WPCOM_APP_SECRET` in `.configure-files/wpcom_app_credentials`.\n1. Recompile and run the app on a device or an simulator.\n\nYou can only log in with the WordPress.com account that you used to create the WordPress application.\n\n### Third party tools\n\nWe use a few tools to help with development. Running `rake dependencies` will configure them for you.\n\n#### CocoaPods\n\nWordPress for iOS uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to manage third party libraries.  \nThird party libraries and resources managed by CocoaPods will be installed by the `rake dependencies` command above.\n\n#### SwiftLint\n\nWe use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce a common style for Swift code. The app should build and work without it, but if you plan to write code, you are encouraged to install it. No commit should have lint warnings or errors.\n\nYou can set up a Git [pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) to run SwiftLint automatically when committing by running:\n\n`rake git:install_hooks`\n\nThis is the recommended way to include SwiftLint in your workflow, as it catches lint issues locally before your code makes its way to Github.\n\nAlternately, a SwiftLint scheme is exposed within the project; Xcode will show a warning if you don\'t have SwiftLint installed.\n\nFinally, you can also run SwiftLint manually from the command line with:\n\n`rake lint`\n\nIf your code has any style violations, you can try to automatically correct them by running:\n\n`rake lint:autocorrect`\n\nOtherwise you have to fix them manually.\n\n### Open Xcode\n\nLaunch the workspace by running the following from the command line:\n\n`rake xcode`\n\nThis will ensure any dependencies are ready before launching Xcode. \n\nYou can also open the project by double clicking on WordPress.xcworkspace file, or launching Xcode and choose `File` > `Open` and browse to `WordPress.xcworkspace`.\n\n### Setup Credentials\n\nIn order to login to WordPress.com using the app you will need to create an account over at the [WordPress.com Developer Portal](https://developer.wordpress.com).\n\nAfter you created an account you can create an application on the [WordPress.com applications manager](https://developer.wordpress.com/apps/).\n\nWhen creating your application, you should select "Native client" for the application type. The applications manager currently requires a "redirect URL", but this isn\'t used for mobile apps. Just use "https://localhost".\n\nAfter you created an application you will have an associated a client ID and a client secret key. These details will be used to authenticate your application and verify that the API calls being made are valid. \n\nIn order to use these details, you\'ll need to create a credential file in your build machine. Start by copying the sample credentials file in your local repo by doing this:\n\n`cp WordPress/Credentials/wpcom_app_credentials-example .configure-files/wpcom_app_credentials`\n\nThen edit the `WordPress/Credentials/wpcom_app_credentials-example` file and change the `WPCOM_APP_ID` and `WPCOM_APP_SECRET` fields to the values you got for your app.\n\nThen you can compile and run the app on a simulator and log in with a WordPress.com account.  Note that authenticating to WordPress.com via Google is not supported in development builds of the app, only in the official release.\n\n**Remember the only account you will be able to login in with is the one affiliated with your developer account.** \n\nRead more about [OAuth2](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oauth2/) and the [WordPress.com REST endpoint](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nRead our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn about reporting issues, contributing code, and more ways to contribute.\n\n## Security\n\nIf you happen to find a security vulnerability, we would appreciate you letting us know at https://hackerone.com/automattic and allowing us to respond before disclosing the issue publicly.\n\n## Getting in Touch ##\n\nIf you have questions about getting setup or just want to say hi, join the [WordPress Slack](https://chat.wordpress.org) and drop a message on the `#mobile` channel.\n\n## Resources\n\n- The [docs](docs/) contain information about our development practices.\n- [WordPress Mobile Blog](http://make.wordpress.org/mobile)\n- [WordPress Mobile Handbook](http://make.wordpress.org/mobile/handbook/)\n\n## License\n\nWordPress for iOS is an Open Source project covered by the [GNU General Public License version 2](LICENSE).\n'
