Easily manage meta for posts, terms, users, comments, or create custom option pages.\n\n**[Download plugin on wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/)**\n\nCMB2 is a complete rewrite of [Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress). To get started, please follow the examples in the included `example-functions.php` file and have a look at the [basic usage instructions](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/wiki/Basic-Usage).\n\nYou can see a list of available field types [here](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2/wiki/Field-Types#types).\n\nIf you are coming from the original "Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress" plugin, [please read this post](https://webdevstudios.com/2015/02/02/cmb2-wordpress-plugin/) for the CMB2 background story.\n\n### Contribution\nDevelopment occurs on Github, and all contributions welcome.

It will only load the newest version in the system.\n\n## Translation\nIf you are looking to provide language translation files, Please do so via [WordPress Plugin Translations](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/cmb2).\n\n## 3rd Party Resources\n\n#### Custom Field Types\n* [CMB2 Field Type: CMB Attached Posts Field](https://github.com/coreymcollins/cmb-attached-posts) from [coreymcollins](https://github.com/coreymcollins): `custom_attached_posts`, for attaching posts to a page.\n* [CMB2 Field Type: Post Search Ajax](https://github.com/alexis-magina/cmb2-field-post-search-ajax) by [alexis-magina](https://github.com/alexis-magina): `post_search_ajax` Attach posts to each other.
