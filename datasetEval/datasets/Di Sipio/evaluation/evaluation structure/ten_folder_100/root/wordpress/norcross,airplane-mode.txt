WP loads certain external files (fonts, Gravatar, etc.) and makes external HTTP calls. This isn't usually an issue, unless you're working in an evironment without a web connection. This plugin removes/unhooks those actions to reduce load time and avoid errors due to missing files.\n\n## Current Actions\n* removes external JS and CSS files from loading\n* replaces all instances of Gravatar with a local image to remove external call\n* removes all HTTP requests\n* disables all WP update checks for core, languages, themes, and plugins\n* includes toggle in admin bar for quick enable / disable\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).\n\n## Notes\nIf you need offline activation, see [this script](https://gist.github.com/solepixel/e1d03f4dcd1b9e86552b3cc6937325bf) written by [Brian DiChiara](https://github.com/solepixel)\n\n## Roadmap\n* fine tune HTTP request removal\n* find other calls from core\n* add other requests from popular plugins\n\n#### [Pull requests](https://github.com/norcross/airplane-mode/pulls) are very much welcome and encouraged.\n"
