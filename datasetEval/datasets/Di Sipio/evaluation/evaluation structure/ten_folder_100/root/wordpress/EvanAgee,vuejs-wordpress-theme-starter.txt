b"![image](http://res.cloudinary.com/evanagee/image/upload/v1507763167/VueWP/vue-wordpress-sitting-in-a-tree.jpg)\n\n# vuejs-wordpress-theme-starter\n\nA true WordPress theme with the guts ripped out and replaced with Vue.\n\n**Who's this for?** When I started diving into using Vue in WordPress I found plenty of great starters for headless WordPress, but I had the added constraint of needing to run the front and backend on the same host, thus this project was created.\n\n## Features\n\n- [VueRouter](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) integrated\n- [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) integrated (with sample WordPress-centric modules)\n- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for API requests\n- Follows the development guidelines/structure set forth by Vuejs\n- Bare essentials needed for a functional WordPress theme\n- All requests are redirected back to the index.php so your Vue routing is respected.\n- PostCSS support\n\n## Getting started\n\n[![Watch the getting started video](http://res.cloudinary.com/evanagee/image/upload/v1508649085/VueWP/youtube.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFTsbSRJuIw)\n\n- Clone the repo inside of your `wp-content/themes/` directory\n- Navigate to the theme directory and run\n  `npm install`\n  `npm run watch` for development\n  `npm run production` when you're ready to deploy the theme.\n\n## Video Training\n\n- [Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFTsbSRJuIw)\n- [How to add WordPress menu support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa_muCUHUuM)\n\n## New to Vue?\n\nNot sure where to begin? The [Vuejs documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) is actually amazing, but if you're looking for video training I highly recommend the free [Learn Vue 2: Step By Step](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step) course over at Laracasts. There's also a [great playlist by Academind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXY1UyQfSFw&list=PL55RiY5tL51qxUbODJG9cgrsVd7ZHbPrt) available on YouTube that covers pretty much everything you'd want to know about building a fully-featured Vue app.\n\nI've created a couple of example components in `src/components/widgets` to give you an idea of how to work with the Vuex store data.\n\nIf you're new to Vue/Vuex I would do the following:\n\n- Open up `src/app.js` this is the main JS file for the app and will give you a glimpse into what's going on behind the scenes.\n- Next open up `src/App.vue` this is the primary app component, a page wrapper of sorts. It contains the header/footer and the `<router-view>` component which is what loads in all of the other screens as you navigate around the app. Note that by default `src/components/Home.vue` is loaded into the `router-view` initially.\n- Next open up `src/routes/index.js` and notice how the routes are setup by default. Out of the box there is only one route, the `/` or home view. For more information on setting up routing within your app checkout [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/).\n- Next is the Vuex store. I won't cover how that works here as it's a tiny bit more advanced. Check out all files in `src/store` and start to familiarize yourself with what's going on. It's based on the official Vuex example project setup and uses Vuex modules. By default I've included a couple of modules I thought you might need.\n\nThe first thing you're probably going to want to do is start editing and components in `src/components/`.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nAll of the code you're going to edit is located in `/src/`. From there it's broken into a few logical directories.\n\n- `/src`\n  - `/api` for API requests\n  - `/assets` for images mostly\n  - `/components` Vue components\n  - `/router` vue-router directives\n  - `/store` vuex store and modules\n  - `/assets/css` CSS styles\n  - `/vendor` 3rd party scripts and libraries\n\nAll scripts and styles in `/src` are compiled down to the `/dist` directory, which is what you will deploy. **When you're ready to deploy don't deploy the src/ directory.**\n\n## External References\n\n- [Creating Vuex Modules](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/modules.html)\n- [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router)\n- [WordPress REST API](http://v2.wp-api.org/)\n\n## Features coming soon:\n\n- More documentation\n\n# Changelog\n\n## 2019-02-05\n\n### Added\n\n- Support for postcss\n- New css style examples\n- Cache busters for js and css\n\n### Changed\n\n- Updated outdated npm packages\n- Recent post and Page widgets to use router-link\n- Removed Laravel Mix and replaced with standard webpack config\n\n### Removed\n\n- Example Firebase integration\n- jQuery\n- Several unused npm dependencies\n- Bootstrap / Bootstrap Vue\n- Several variables that were stored on the window object\n- Support for sass styling (switched to postcss)\n\n## 2018-08-20\n\n### Added\n\n- Default routing for posts and pages. @EvanAgee\n- Views for posts and pages. @EvanAgee\n- getters for pages. @EvanAgee\n- Examples for fetching pages/posts with either Vuex actions OR in component. @EvanAgee\n- Activated LocalStorage plugin in store. @EvanAgee\n- Loader component. @EvanAgee\n\n### Removed\n\n- UglifyJS. @EvanAgee\n\n## 2017-10-24\n\n### Added\n\n- status_header(200) to keep Wordpress from returning 404 for vue-router paths.\n\n## 2017-10-21\n\n### Removed\n\n- vue-slick dependency\n- vue2-google-maps dependency\n- unnecessary header/footer php files\n- the-tailor dependency\n- font-awesome dependency\n\n### Changed\n\n- Updated webpack (Larevel Mix) config\n- Switched from Bootstrap to [Bootstrap-Vue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed index.php\n\n---\n\n## 2017-10-17\n\n### Added\n\n- More documnentation. @EvanAgee\n- Post module. @EvanAgee\n- A few code comments. @EvanAgee\n- Example widgets for posts and pages. @EvanAgee\n\n## Changed\n\n- Home page to display the posts and pages widgets. @EvanAgee\n\n## 2017-10-11\n\nInitial commit\n"
