Please ensure you have the following tools installed before contributing. \n\n* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)\n* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)\n* [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)\n\n### Getting started\nAfter installing the aforementioned tools, you can use the steps below to acquire a development version of Yoast SEO.\nPlease note that this will download the latest development version of Yoast SEO. While this version is usually stable,\nit is not recommended for use in a production environment.\n\nWithin your WordPress installation, navigate to `wp-content/plugins` and run the following commands:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo.git\ncd wordpress-seo\n```\n\nTo install all the necessary dependencies, run the following commands:\n```bash\ncomposer install\nyarn\ngrunt build\n```\n\nPlease note that if you change anything in the JavaScript or CSS, you\'ll have to run `grunt build:js` or `grunt build:css`, respectively.\n\nThis repository uses [the Yoast grunt tasks plugin](https://github.com/Yoast/plugin-grunt-tasks).\n\n### Developing JavaScript dependencies\n\nYoast SEO uses some JavaScript code that is managed outside of this repository. This code is being maintained in a monorepo: [Yoast/javascript](https://github.com/Yoast/javascript). If you need to change anything in one or more of the packages included in the monorepo, you\'ll need to do the following:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Yoast/javascript.git # Only the first time.\nyarn link-monorepo # You will be prompted for the location of your Yoast/javascript clone. This will is "./javascript" if you cloned it inside the wordpress-seo directory. Your preference will be saved in a .yoast file for later use.\ngrunt build \n```\n\nThis [links](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/) all [Yoast managed JavaScript packages](https://github.com/yoast/javascript) to your installation of the plugin. Most branches on the wordpress-seo repository also exist on the javascript repository. Please find which branch to use in the table below. If the branch you\'re looking for does not exist, feel free to default to develop (or create the branch yourself if you\'re making changes).\n\n| Yoast/wordpress-seo | Yoast/javascript |\n| ------------------- | ---------------- |\n| master              | master           |\n| trunk               | develop          |\n| feature/x           | feature/x        |\n\nYou can now modify the code of the linked packages directly from the `node_modules` (as they\'re now symlinked to your `javascript` clone) or your javascript directory. Please remember to run a `grunt build:js` from the `wordpress-seo` directory after making changes in order to apply those changes to the plugin. \n\n If you don\'t want to use the latest development version of the Yoast JavaScript packages anymore, you can restore the versions as specified in the [package.json](package.json) by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nyarn unlink-monorepo\ngrunt build\n```\n\n## Support\n\nThis is a developer\'s portal for Yoast SEO and should not be used for support.
