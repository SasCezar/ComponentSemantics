We are equally as happy to take any feedback through Github as Github Issues or Pull Requests on any repository. We are always looking for feedback, feature requests, or technical inquiries on this repository or by email at datagov**@**gsa.gov.

The data catalog at [catalog.data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov) is powered by CKAN, while the content seen at [Data.gov](http://Data.gov) is powered by WordPress.  \n        \n**This repository provides the [issue tracker](https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/issues) for all code, bugs, and feature requests related to Data.gov.** Currently the repository is only used for source version control on the code for the WordPress template, but you will also find pointers to the relevant CKAN code and additional resources documented below.\n\n### CKAN\n\n* **CKAN.** The Data.gov team recommends the [latest version of CKAN](http://ckan.org/developers/docs-and-download/).\n* **Data.gov CKAN.** The code powering the Data.gov instance of CKAN. \n    * [release-datagov](https://github.com/GSA/ckan/tree/release-datagov) - The main development branch used for the current [catalog.data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov).\n    * [GSA/ckanext-geodatagov](https://github.com/GSA/ckanext-geodatagov) - Most data.gov specific CKAN customizations are contained within this extension, but the extension also provides additional geospatial capabilities.  \n    * [ckanext-datagovtheme](https://github.com/GSA/ckanext-datagovtheme) - The CKAN theme for catalog.data.gov\n* **Extensions.** The Data.gov team has developed several CKAN extensions, but these are still in the process of being packaged for more widespread use. The [full list of installed extensions can be seen via the CKAN API](http://catalog.data.gov/api/util/status). Custom extensions include:\n   * [GSA/ckanext-datajson](https://github.com/GSA/ckanext-datajson) - A CKAN extension for [Project Open Data](https://project-open-data.github.io) /data.json harvesting and publishing. \n   * [GSA/USMetadata](https://github.com/GSA/USMetadata) - A CKAN extension to support the [Project Open Data](https://project-open-data.github.io) metadata schema within the CKAN user interface. \n* **Other Tools**  \n   * [GSA/ckan-php-client](https://github.com/GSA/ckan-php-client) - A CKAN php client for Data.gov.\n   * [GSA/ckan-php-manager](https://github.com/GSA/ckan-php-manager) - A CKAN php manager for Data.gov.    \n* **Deployment.** We are in the process of improving documentation and hope to provide build scripts and configurations for tools like [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) to make setting up the Data.gov CKAN easier for others.  \n\n### WordPress\n\n* **WordPress.** The Data.gov team recommends the [latest version of WordPress](http://wordpress.org/download/).\n* **Data.gov WordPress template.** The code powering the Data.gov WordPress template.\n    * [GSA/data.gov](https://github.com/GSA/data.gov) or *this repository*.
