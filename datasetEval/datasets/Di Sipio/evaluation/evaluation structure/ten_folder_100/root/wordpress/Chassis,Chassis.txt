b"# Chassis\n\nChassis is a virtual server for your WordPress site, built using [Vagrant][].\n\nChassis is basically a way to run WordPress (and related parts, such as PHP and\nnginx) without needing to worry about setting up anything. You can imagine it as\nMAMP/WAMP on steroids.\n\n[Vagrant]: http://vagrantup.com/\n\n## Installing & Documentation\n\nFollow our [quickstart instructions](http://docs.chassis.io/en/latest/quickstart/)\nto get up and running right away!\n\nWe've got tonnes more documentation available at http://chassis.io/ to peruse\nthrough at your leisure.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How is Chassis different from [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV)?\n\nEach Chassis install is self-contained. We do this to try and mirror the server\nthat you will be deploying to.\n\nNote that while you can't have multiple independent installs on the same Chassis\nbox, we support both subdomain and subdirectory multisite out of the box.\n\n### Can you add X?\n\nWhile we certainly can add any feature, consider first if it's better off as a\nChassis extension. We try and keep Chassis as lightweight as possible, and\nextensions are a good way of adding features without weighing down\nChassis itself.\n"
