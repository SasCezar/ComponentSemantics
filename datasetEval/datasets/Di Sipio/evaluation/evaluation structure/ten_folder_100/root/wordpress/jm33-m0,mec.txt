b'# massExploitConsole\na collection of hacking tools with a cli ui\n\n [![Bless](https://cdn.rawgit.com/LunaGao/BlessYourCodeTag/master/tags/bacon.svg)](http://lunagao.github.io/BlessYourCodeTag/)\n\n> take a look at [mec-ng](https://github.com/jm33-m0/mec-ng "new mec, written in Go")\n\n## screenshot\n\n![](/screenshot/main.png)\n\n\n## disclaimer\n\n- please use this tool only on **authorized systems**, im not responsible for any damage caused by users who ignore my warning\n- exploits are adapted from other sources, please refer to their author info\n- please note, due to my limited programming experience (it\'s my first Python project), you can expect some silly bugs\n\n\n## features\n\n- [x] an easy-to-use cli ui\n- [x] execute any adpated exploits with **process-level concurrency**\n- [x] some built-in exploits (automated)\n- [x] hide your ip addr using `proxychains4` and `ss-proxy` (built-in)\n- [x] zoomeye host scan (10 threads)\n- [x] a simple baidu crawler (multi-threaded)\n- [x] censys host scan\n- [x] built-in ssh bruteforcer\n\n## getting started\n\n```bash\ngit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/jm33-m0/massExpConsole.git && cd massExpConsole && ./install.py\n```\n\n- type `proxy` command to run a pre-configured [Shadowsocks](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go) socks5 proxy in the background, `vim ./data/ss.json` to edit proxy config. and, `ss-proxy` exits with `mec.py`\n\n\n## requirements\n\n- `install.py` supports Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, Linux Mint, Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, Arch. for CentOS/RHEL, you might need to manually configure python3 environment before installing\n- Python 3.5 or later\n- `proxychains4` (in `$PATH`), used by mec core, requires a working socks5 proxy (you can modify its config in `mec.py`)\n- Java is required when using Java deserialization exploits\n- **note** that you have to install all the deps of your exploits or tools as well\n\n\n## usage\n\n- just run `mec`, if it complains about missing modules, install them\n- if you want to add your own exploit script (or binary file, whatever):\n    - `cd exploits`, `mkdir <your_exploit_dir>`\n    - your exploit should take the last argument passed to it as its target, dig into `mec.py` to know more\n    - `chmod +x <exploit>` to make sure it can be executed by current user\n    - use `attack` command then `m` to select your custom exploit\n- type `help` in the console to see all available features\n- `zoomeye` requires a valid user account config file `zoomeye.conf`\n\n\n## how to contribute\n\n- if you had any issues, please report them to *[https://github.com/jm33-m0/massExpConsole/issues](https://github.com/jm33-m0/massExpConsole/issues)*\n- open a pull request when you have fixed any bugs or added any features\n- i would appreciate you adding your own adapted exploits to this repo\n'
