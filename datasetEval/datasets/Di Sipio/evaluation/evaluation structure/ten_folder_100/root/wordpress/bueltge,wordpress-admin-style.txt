b'# WordPress Admin Style\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fbueltge%2Fwordpress-admin-style.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fbueltge%2Fwordpress-admin-style?ref=badge_shield)\n[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/bueltge/wordpress-admin-style/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/bueltge/wordpress-admin-style)\n\nShows the WordPress admin styles on one page to help you to develop WordPress compliant\n\n * List markup and examples for \'2 Column Page Layout\', Headers, Header Icons, Buttons, Tables, Admin Notices, \nAlternative Colours, Pagination, Form Elements, Form Helper Functions, Tabs, Default Admin Color Schemes\n * Helper Classes\n * jQuery UI Examples\n * [Dashicons](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/)\n * [Genericons](http://genericons.com/)\n\n## Description\nWordPress is developing fast - this also applies to the design of the backend. \nSo it is important not to use your own styles in the admin area and use tags and classes of WordPress. \nThis is the best way you can simplify your work as a developer, and you don\'t have to test the design with every update. \nUnfortunately, there are quite extensive opportunities in the backend to implement the requirements. \nSeveral different classes and HTML structures are used. To be able to look up something this simple, \nI have developed this small plugin, which tinkers in the development environment and quickly represents the necessary elements. \n\nAlso see the [post](http://wpengineer.com/2226/new-plugin-to-style-your-plugin-on-wordpress-admin-with-default-styles/) \nabout the idea and also the comments for a discussion.\n\n### Screenshots & history\n\n![Part of the Admin Style information in WordPress version 5.3](./assets/screenshot-7.png)\n\nThe plugin is still active in usage and development since an early WordPress version, so you should see it on the screenshots from the different versions below.\n\n 1.
