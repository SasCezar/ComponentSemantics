It\'s available to download for free from the WordPress [theme repository](https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/).\n\nIt features deep integration with WooCommerce core plus several of the most popular extensions:\n\n* [WooCommerce Bookings](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-bookings/)\n* [WooCommerce Wishlists](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-wishlists/)\n* [WooCommerce Brands](https://woocommerce.com/products/brands/)\n* [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/)\n\nFor developers, Storefront is the perfect starting point for your project. It\'s lean and extensible codebase will allow you to easily add functionality to your site via child theme and/or custom plugin(s).\n\n## Storefront extensions\nLooking to take your storefront powered store to the next level? Be sure to checkout the premium [Storefront extensions](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/storefront-extensions/).\n\n## Storefront Documentation\nYou can view detailed Storefront documentation on the [WooCommerce documentation website](https://docs.woocommerce.com/documentation/themes/storefront/).\n\n## Storefront in your language\nStorefront translations can be downloaded from [WordPress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/storefront). To use one of these translations it is recommended that you upload it to `wp-content/languages/themes/storefront-pt_BR.mo`. Adding it to this location means the file will not be lost when you update Storefront. It is however possible to add a translation to the `languages` folder in your child theme if you\'d prefer.\n\n## Storefront help & support\nWooCommerce customers can get support at the [WooCommerce support portal](https://woocommerce.com/contact-us/). Otherwise, you can try posting on the [WordPress support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/theme/storefront/).
