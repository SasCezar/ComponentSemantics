With Timber, you write your HTML using the [Twig Template Engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) separate from your PHP files.\n\nThis cleans up your theme code so, for example, your PHP file can focus on being the data/logic, while your Twig file can focus 100% on the HTML and display.\n\nThis is what Timber\'s `.twig` files look like (from this [Hello World example](https://gist.github.com/jarednova/dc75030fd2c7dd6fe52a6fef459c450e))\n\n```twig\n{% extends "base.twig" %}\n{% block content %}\n  <h1 class="big-title">{{ foo }}</h1>\n  <h2 class="post-title">{{ post.title }}</h2>\n  <img src="{{ post.thumbnail.src }}" />\n  <div class="body">\n\t{{ post.content }}\n  </div>\n{% endblock %}\n```\nOnce Timber is installed and activated in your `plugins` directory, it gives any WordPress theme the ability to take advantage of the power of Twig and other Timber features.\n\n### Looking for docs?\n* [Timber Documentation](https://timber.github.io/docs/)\n* [Twig Reference](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html)\n* [Overview / Getting Started Guide](https://timber.github.io/docs/getting-started/)\n* [Video Tutorials](https://timber.github.io/docs/getting-started/video-tutorials/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Installation\n\nThe GitHub version of Timber requires [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and is setup for inclusion _within_ a theme or plugin. If you\'d prefer one-click installation for your site, you should use the [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/) version.\n\n```shell\ncd ~/wp-content/themes/my-theme\ncomposer require timber/timber\n```\n\nIf your theme/plugin is not setup to pull in Composer\'s autoload file, you will need to\n\n```php\n/* functions.php */\nrequire_once(__DIR__ . \'/vendor/autoload.php\');\n```\n\nAfter this line, initialize Timber with\n```php\n$timber = new \\Timber\\Timber();\n```\n\n### What Now?\n\nSetup the [Timber Starter Theme](https://timber.github.io/docs/getting-started/setup/#use-the-starter-theme). Once you have that installed in your WordPress setup, continue reading the [Getting Started guide to Themeing](https://timber.github.io/docs/getting-started/theming/).\n\n* * *\n\n### Mission Statement\n\nTimber is a tool for developers who want to translate their HTML into high-quality WordPress themes through an intuitive, consistent and fully-accessible interface.\n* **Intuitive**: The API is written to be user-centric around a programmer\'s expectations.\n* **Consistent**: WordPress objects can be accessed through common polymorphic properties like slug, ID and name.\n* **Accessible**: No black boxes. Every effort is made so the developer has access to 100% of their HTML.\n\n#### What does it look like?\nNothing. Timber is meant for you to build a theme on. Like [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) it comes style-free, because you\'re the style expert. Instead, Timber handles the logic you need to make a kick-ass looking site.\n\n#### Who is it good for?\nTimber is great for any WordPress developer who cares about writing good, maintainable code. It helps teams of designers and developers working together. At [Upstatement](http://upstatement.com) we made Timber because while our entire team needs to participate in building WordPress sites, not everyone knows the ins-and-outs of the_loop(),  codex and PHP (nor should they). With Timber your best WordPress engineer can focus on building the `.php` files with requests from WordPress and pass the data into `.twig` files. Once there, designers can easily mark-up data and build out a site\'s look-and-feel.\n\n#### Related & Official Projects\n* [**Twig**](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig) The template language used by Timber.\n* [**Timber Starter Theme**](https://github.com/timber/starter-theme) The "_s" of Timber to give you an easy start to the most basic theme you can build upon and customize.\n* [**Timber Debug Bar**](https://github.com/timber/debug-bar-timber) Adds a debug bar panel that will show you which template is in-use and the data sent to your twig file.\n\n#### Related Timber Projects\n* [**Pine**](https://github.com/azeemhassni/pine) A CLI _installer_ for Timber\n* [**Timber CLI**](https://github.com/nclud/wp-timber-cli) A CLI for Timber\n* [**Timber Commented Include**](https://github.com/djboris88/timber-commented-include) Debug output via HTML comments before and after each include statement in Twig\n* [**Timber Debugger**](https://github.com/djboris88/timber-debugger) Package that provides extra debugging options for Timber\n* [**Timber Dump Extension**](https://github.com/nlemoine/timber-dump-extension) Debug output with nice formatting\n* [**Timber Photon**](https://github.com/slimndap/TimberPhoton) Plug-in to use JetPack\'s free Photon image manipulation and CDN with Timber\n* [**Timber VS Code Extension**](https://github.com/JDevx97/Timber-Snippets) Snippets for Timber in Visual Studio Code\n* [**Timber Sugar**](https://github.com/timber/sugar) A catch-all for goodies to use w Timber\n* [**Timber WebLink Extension**](https://github.com/nlemoine/timber-weblink-extension) Provides Twig functions to manage the Link HTTP header needed for Web Linking when using HTTP/2 Server Push as well as Resource Hints\n* [**Timmy**](https://github.com/MINDKomm/Timmy) Advanced image manipulation for Timber\n* [**Timber ACF WP Blocks**](https://github.com/palmiak/timber-acf-wp-blocks) Easy ACF Gutenberg blocks creation\n\n#### Projects that use Timber\n* [**Branch**](https://github.com/JeyKeu/branch/) Bootstrap 3 + Timber = Branch starter theme!\n* [**Gantry5**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gantry5/) a framework for theme development\n* [**Seedling**](https://github.com/maxdmyers/seedling) A starter theme using Bootstrap 4\n\n\n#### Helpful Links\n* [**CSS Tricks**](https://css-tricks.com/timber-and-twig-reignited-my-love-for-wordpress/) introduction to Timber by [@tjFogarty](https://github.com/tjFogarty)\n* [**Twig for Timber Cheatsheet**](http://notlaura.com/the-twig-for-timber-cheatsheet/) by [@laras126](https://github.com/laras126)\n* [**TutsPlus**](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/kick-start-wordpress-development-with-twig-introduction--cms-24781) A guide to getting started by [@ahmadawais](https://github.com/ahmadawais)\n\n#### Support\nPlease post on [StackOverflow under the "Timber" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/timber).
