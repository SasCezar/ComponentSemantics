As an alternative rendering engine for WordPress.\n1. As a React framework to create WordPress themes.\n\nBoth are true :)\n\n## 1. An alternative rendering engine for WordPress\n\nIn the past the only way to get HTML out of WordPress was to use its **PHP rendering engine**. Quite an old friend, isn\'t it? ;)\n\nBut in WordPress 4.7 the [**WP API**](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) was included in the core.\n\n> _An API is a protocol to retrieve content from an external service._\n\nThanks to the **WP API**, developers are not longer limited to the **PHP rendering engine**. They can retrieve their WordPress content and use it wherever they want. A new world of possibilities started.\n\nOne of those possibilities is to create WordPress themes using React. That\'s where **Frontity** comes into play.\n\n## 2. A React framework to create WordPress themes\n\n[**React**](https://reactjs.org/) is a super powerful library for building user interfaces. It was created by **Facebook** and is taking over front-end development.\n\nBut, in spite of how amazing it is, React is just **a JavaScript library, not a framework**. It does not assume anything about the other parts in any full solution. It focuses on just one thing, and on doing that thing very well.\n\nIn order to create a WordPress theme with React, developers need to learn and configure lots of different things: _bundling, transpiling, routing, server rendering, retrieving data from WordPress, managing state, managing css, linting, testing..._\n\n**There is a reason React frameworks exist**. For example, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [GatbsyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) are two amazing React frameworks. Both _can_ work with WordPress, but they are not focused on WordPress. Therefore, there\'s still some configuration and additional tooling left to the developer.\n\n[**Frontity**](https://frontity.org), on the other hand, is an **opinionated React framework focused on WordPress**:\n\n- **Focused on WordPress:** each part of the framework has been simplified and optimized to be used with WordPress.\n- **Opinionated framework:** developers don\'t need to figure out what tools to use for things like css or state management.\n\nThis means everything is ready so you can jump in and create a new amazing WordPress theme using React right away! \xf0\x9f\x8e\x89\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\n\n---\n\n#### Curious?

In order to generate HTML for the visitors or Google, the server needs to be able to run JavaScript as well.\n\n> _In theory a PHP server can send an empty HTML with the JavaScript files and the visitor will see the page after the JavaScript has loaded, but it is not a good user experience and certainly not recommended if your site needs to rank in Google._\n\n**Frontity** is prepared to be hosted either in a regular Node.js server or in **serverless** services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda), [Now](https://zeit.co/now), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Google Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) and so on. That makes it super cheap and infinitely scalable.\n\nOh, and by the way, **Frontity is extensible**. It allows you to easily add new features to your theme via extensions and NPM packages without having to create them from scratch. Right now, we are working on extensions like _Disqus comments, OneSignal notifications, Adsense, Doubleclick, SmartAds, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Custom CSS or Custom HTML_. This means, Frontity Themes won\'t have to reinvent the wheel and include the same functionalities over and over.\n\n---\n\nDiscover all features here >> **[Frontity features](https://docs.frontity.org/frontity-features)**.\n\n---\n\n# \xc2\xbb How is Frontity organized?\n\nGitHub is where magic happens, but there are more channels where you can find information about the project, discuss about it and get involved:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\xf0\x9f\x93\x96 <strong>Docs</strong>: this is the place to learn how to build amazing sites with Frontity. <a href="https://docs.frontity.org/getting-started">Get started!</a></li>\n  <li>:family_man_woman_girl_boy: <strong>Community</strong>: use our forum to share any doubts, feedback and meet great people.
