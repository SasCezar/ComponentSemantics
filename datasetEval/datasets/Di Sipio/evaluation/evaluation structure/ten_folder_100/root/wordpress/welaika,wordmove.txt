b'# Wordmove\n\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/welaika/wordmove/master/assets/images/wordmove.png)\n\nWordmove is a gem that lets you automatically mirror local WordPress\ninstallations and DB data back and forth from your local development machine to\nthe remote server.\n\nWordmove has also a neat hook system which enables you to run arbitrary commands\nbefore and after push/pull actions. Local and remote commands are both supported, but remote\nones will be run only if using SSH protocol. Read the [dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Hooks) for more info.\n\n[FTP support has been discontinued](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/FTP-support-disclaimer), thus most recent features won\'t work,\nwhile base functionalities are granted.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/welaika/wordmove.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/welaika/wordmove)\n[![Slack channel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Slack-WP--Hub-blue.svg)](https://wphub-auto-invitation.herokuapp.com/)\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/wordmove.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/wordmove)\n[![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/welaika/wordmove.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/welaika/wordmove/)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThat\'s easy:\n\n    gem install wordmove\n\nAnd to update:\n\n    gem update wordmove\n\n## Peer dependencies\n\nWordmove just acts as automation glue between tools you already have and love. These are its peer dependencies which you need to have installed and in your $PATH:\n\n| Program   | Actions                      | Mandatory?                      |\n| -------   | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| rsync     | Mirror files and dirs        | Yes for SSH connections         |\n| mysql     | Import database              | Yes                             |\n| mysqldump | Dump database                | Yes                             |\n| wp-cli    | Adapt database               | Yes by default, but configurable|\n| lftp      | all                          | Yes, for FTP connections        |\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n> wordmove help\nCommands:\n  wordmove --version, -v    # Print the version\n  wordmove doctor           # Do some local configuration and environment checks\n  wordmove help [TASK]      # Describe available tasks or one specific task\n  wordmove init             # Generates a brand new movefile.yml\n  wordmove pull             # Pulls WP data from remote host to the local machine\n  wordmove push             # Pushes WP data from local machine to remote host\n```\n\nMove inside the WordPress folder and use `wordmove init` to generate a new `movefile.yml` and edit it with your settings. Read the next paragraph for more info.\n\n**See the wiki article: [Usage and flags explained](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Usage-and-flags-explained) for more info.**\n\n### Screencasts\n\n* Push all WordPress, including database and uploads: http://vimeo.com/74648079\n* Pull database and uploads, adapting paths and urls: http://vimeo.com/74646861\n* Push only theme, transfer only modified files: http://vimeo.com/74647529\n\n## movefile.yml\n\nYou can configure Wordmove creating a `movefile.yml`. That\'s a YAML file with local and remote host(s) infos:\n\n```yaml\nglobal:\n  sql_adapter: wpcli\n\nlocal:\n  vhost: http://vhost.local\n  wordpress_path: /home/john/sites/your_site # use an absolute path here\n\n  database:\n    name: database_name\n    user: user\n    password: password\n    host: localhost\n\n  # paths: # you can customize wordpress internal paths\n  #   wp_content: wp-content\n  #   uploads: wp-content/uploads\n  #   plugins: wp-content/plugins\n  #   themes: wp-content/themes\n  #   languages: wp-content/languages\n\nproduction:\n  vhost: http://example.com\n  wordpress_path: /var/www/your_site # use an absolute path here\n\n  database:\n    name: database_name\n    user: user\n    password: password\n    host: host\n    # port: 3308 # Use just in case you have exotic server config\n    # mysqldump_options: --max_allowed_packet=50MB # Only available if using SSH\n    # mysql_options: --protocol=TCP # Only available if using SSH\n\n  exclude:\n    - \'.git/\'\n    - \'.gitignore\'\n    - \'node_modules/\'\n    - \'bin/\'\n    - \'tmp/*\'\n    - \'Gemfile*\'\n    - \'Movefile\'\n    - \'movefile\'\n    - \'movefile.yml\'\n    - \'movefile.yaml\'\n    - \'wp-config.php\'\n    - \'wp-content/*.sql.gz\'\n    - \'*.orig\'\n\n  ssh:\n    host: host\n    user: user\n\n  # hooks: # Remote hooks won\'t work with FTP\n  #   push:\n  #     before:\n  #       local:\n  #         - \'echo "Do something locally before push"\'\n  #       remote:\n  #         - \'echo "Do something remotely before push"\'\n  #     after:\n  #       local:\n  #         - \'echo "Do something locally after push"\'\n  #       remote:\n  #         - \'echo "Do something remotely after push"\'\n  #   pull:\n  #     before:\n  #       local:\n  #         - \'echo "Do something locally before pull"\'\n  #       remote:\n  #         - \'echo "Do something remotely before pull"\'\n  #     after:\n  #       local:\n  #         - \'echo "Do something locally after pull"\'\n  #       remote:\n  #         - \'echo "Do something remotely after pull"\'\n```\n\n**We warmly recommend to read the wiki article [Multiple environments explained\n](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Multiple-environments-explained) if you need multi-stage support,\nand the wiki article [Movefile configurations explained](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/movefile.yml-configurations-explained)\nto understand about the supported configurations.**\n\n## Multistage\n\nYou can define multiple environments in your `movefile.yml`, such as production, staging, etc.\nUse `-e` with `pull` or `push` to run the command on the specified environment.\n\nFor example:\n\n    wordmove push -e staging -d\n\nwill push your local database to the staging environment only.\n\nWe warmly **recommend** to read the wiki article: [Multiple environments explained\n](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Multiple-environments-explained)\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nWordmove allows the use of environment variables in your movefiles.\nThis is useful in order to protect sensitive variables and credentials, as well as make it easy to share movefiles between your team.\n\nEnvironment variables are written using the **ERB tags** syntax:\n```\n"<%= ENV[\'YOUR_SECRET_NAME\'] %>"\n```\n\n### Variables set up\nEnvironment variables can be set up using two methods:\n\n#### Using the shell:\n```bash\n# bash\nexport PROD_DB_USER="username" PROD_DB_PASS="password"\n\n# fish\nset --export --global PROD_DB_USER "username"; set --export --global PROD_DB_PASS "password"\n```\n#### Using a `.env` file:\n\nWordmove supports the [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) module.\n\nSimply create a `.env` file next to your movefile structured as follows:\n```bash\nPROD_DB_USER="username"\nPROD_DB_PASS="password"\n```\nWordmove will take care of loading the file  and making the environment variables ready to be used in your configuration file.\n\nYou may also use `.env.{environmentname}`, but this is discouraged.\n\n### Use them in your `movefile.yml`\nUsing the ERB syntax described above, write your movefile as follows:\n```yaml\nproduction:\n  database:\n    user: "<%= ENV[\'PROD_DB_USER\'] %>"\n    password: "<%= ENV[\'PROD_DB_PASS\'] %>"\n```\n\n### System variables\nYou can use system variables to configure your movefile.\n\nFor example:\n```yaml\nlocal:\n  vhost: "http://wordpress-site.localhost"\n  wordpress_path: "<%= ENV[\'HOME\'] %>/[wordpress directory path]/"\n  # wordpress_path will be substituted with /home/user_name/[wordpress directory path]\n```\n\n## Supports\n\n### OS\n\nOS X and Linux are fully supported.\n\nSee the [Windows (un)support disclaimer](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Windows-(un)support-disclaimer)\n\n### Docker\n\nWe have a docker image bringing the latest Wordmove\'s version with autobuild on new releases.\n\n[![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/welaika/wordmove.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/welaika/wordmove/)\n\n### SSH\n\n* You need `rsync` on your machine; as far as we know it\'s already installed on OS X and Linux.\n* To use your SSH public key for authentication, just delete the `production.ssh.password` field in your `movefile.yml`. Easy peasy.\n* writing the password inside `movefile.yml` was and is somewhat supported, but **we discourage this practice** in favor of password-less authentication with pub key. Read [here](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/%5Bdeprecated%5D-SSH-password-inside-Movefile) for old informations.\n\n### FTP and SFTP\n\n* You need to install `lftp` on your machine. See community wiki article: [Install lftp on OSX yosemite](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Install-lftp-on-OSX-yosemite)).\n* Use the relative FTP path as `production.wordpress_path`\n* Use the absolute FTP path as `production.wordpress_absolute_path` (you may need to recover this from the `__FILE__` [magic constant](http://php.net/manual/en/language.constants.predefined.php)\n* if you want to specify a passive FTP connection add to the YAML config a `production.ftp.passive` flag and set it to `true`.\n\nFTP support development is [discontinued](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/FTP-support-disclaimer), but it\'s always there.\n\nSice version 3.2.0 SFTP is fully supported, with same functionalities as FTP, through `production.ftp.scheme`\nconfiguration. More information found in the wiki.\n\n## Notes\n\n### Mirroring\n\nPush and pull actions on files will perform a **mirror** operation. Please, keep\nin mind that to mirror means to transfer new/updated files **and remove files**\nfrom destination if not present in source.\n\nThis means that if you have files/directories on your remotes which you must\npreserve, you **must exclude those in your movefile.yml**, or they will be\ndeleted.\n\n### How the heck you are able to sync the DB via FTP?\n\nWe\'re glad you asked! We basically upload via FTP a PHP script that performs the various\nimport/export operations. This script then gets executed via HTTP. Don\'t worry\ntoo much about security though: the script is deleted just after the usage,\nand can only be executed by `wordmove`, as each time it requires a pre-shared\none-time-password to be run.\n\n### Yanked versions\n\nWordmove `1.3.1` has been removed from `rubygems` due to a bug with FTP deploying system. If you are\nusing this version, please update soon (`gem update wordmove`).\n\n## Need more tools?\nVisit [Wordpress Tools](https://www.wptools.it).\n\n## Credits\n\n* The dump script is the [`MYSQL-dump` PHP package](https://github.com/dg/MySQL-dump) by David Grudl\n* The import script used is the [BigDump](http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump/) library\n\n## Contribute\n\nIn order to promote a simpler contribution workflow we have decided to fork and PR the `master` branch.\nWe will accordingly tag and release or pre-release versions to the rubygems.org repository.\nDo not consider the `dev` branch for your forks and PR.\nWe will never more use version-named branches as in the past, but we\'ll tag release on `master` and pre-release on `dev`.\n\n### Please, **read the full [contributor guide](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Contributor-Guide)**.\n\nFeel free to open an issue about contribution if more you need more info\n\n## Author\n\nmade with \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f and \xe2\x98\x95\xef\xb8\x8f by [weLaika](https://dev.welaika.com)\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2013-2019 weLaika\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \xe2\x80\x98Software\xe2\x80\x99), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \xe2\x80\x98AS IS\xe2\x80\x99, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
