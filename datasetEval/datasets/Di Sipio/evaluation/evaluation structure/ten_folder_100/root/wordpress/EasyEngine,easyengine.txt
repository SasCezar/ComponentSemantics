We have tested this on Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, 18.04 and Debian 8.\n\n```bash\nwget -qO ee https://rt.cx/ee4 && sudo bash ee\n```\n\nEven if the script doesn\'t work for your distribution, you can manually install the dependencies and then run the following commands to install EasyEngine\n\n```bash\nwget -O /usr/local/bin/ee https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EasyEngine/easyengine-builds/master/phar/easyengine.phar\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/ee\n```\n\n### Tab completions\n\nEasyEngine also comes with a tab completion script for Bash and ZSH. Just download [ee-completion.bash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EasyEngine/easyengine/develop-v4/utils/ee-completion.bash) and source it from `~/.bash_profile`:\n\n```bash\nsource /FULL/PATH/TO/ee-completion.bash\n```\n\nDon\'t forget to run `source ~/.bash_profile` afterwards.\n\nIf using zsh for your shell, you may need to load and start `bashcompinit` before sourcing. Put the following in your `.zshrc`:\n\n```bash\nautoload bashcompinit\nbashcompinit\nsource /FULL/PATH/TO/ee-completion.bash\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo get started with EasyEngine and create a wordpress site, run\n\n```\nee site create example.com --type=wp\n```\n\nNeed a wordpress site with caching? Try\n\n```\nee site create example.com --type=wp --cache\n```\n\nNeed a wordpress multi-site with page cache?\n```\nee site create example.com --type=wp --mu=wpsubdir --cache\n```\n\nNeed a plain and simple html site?\n```\nee site create example.com\n```\n\nWant to play around with your new site?\n```\nee shell example.com\n```\n\nWant to know more?
