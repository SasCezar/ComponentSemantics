b'# [babel/website](https://babeljs.io)\n\nThis is the source for the [babeljs.io](https://babeljs.io) website; feel free to suggest changes to our docs!\n\n- Current: `master` branch is deployed to https://babeljs.io\n- Old: `old-site` branch is deployed to https://old.babeljs.io\n\n### Setup\n\n```bash\n$ git clone git@github.com:babel/website.git\n$ cd website\n$ yarn && yarn bootstrap\n```\n\n- Just run `yarn start` next time (check the package.json for scripts).\n\n### Contributing to the website\n\nTo keep documentation in sync across all of Babel\'s packages, the docs are now directly located in this repository. The READMEs in [`babel/babel`](https://github.com/babel/babel) are [auto generated](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/scripts/generators/readmes.js) and point to this documentation.\n\nYou might want to make yourself familiar with [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation) to make significant changes to the website. If you only want to make content changes you just need to know about versioned docs.\n\n#### Versioned docs\n\n- `/docs` - the files in here are responsible for the "next" version at https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next.\n- `/website/versioned_docs/version-*` - these are the docs for the past versions, the latest one being the currently published version at https://babeljs.io/docs/en\n\nAfter making your changes to the markdown files in the `/docs` folder, a git hook script will suggest files from the past versions folders that you might also need to apply your changes to.\n\n#### Looking for support?\n\nFor questions and support on contributing please join our [Slack community](https://slack.babeljs.io/), channel `#website` or directly [here](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/website).\n'
