[Check the website](http://fable.io) for more information and if you find the project useful, don\'t forget to give us a star!\n\n## Getting started\n\nCheck [this page](https://fable.io/docs/2-steps/setup.html).\n\n## Building\n\nMake sure the following **requirements** are installed in your system:\n\n- [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)\n- [node.js](https://nodejs.org) with npm\n\nThen run `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run build` at the root folder to start the build. Check [build.fsx](https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable/blob/4839311afe4cfc3fd0849915c7cdf831ca1ab74c/build.fsx#L218) for other build targets. For example: `npm run build compiler`.\n\nAfter that, if you want to quickly try changes to Fable source, please check `src/quicktest/QuickTest.fs`.\n\n## Using your local build in your projects\n\nMany of you are making really useful contributions that you also need for your own projects, however a new release may take several days. If you need the latest features you can tell `fable-compiler` to use a local build. For this, use the `cli.path` option. For example when using the `fable-loader` you can include the following in your webpack.config.js:\n\n```js\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.fs(x|proj)?$/,\n        use: {\n            loader: "fable-loader",\n            options: {\n                cli: {\n                    // This should be the path to your local clone of Fable\n                    path: "../Fable/src/Fable.Cli"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n```\n\n**ATTENTION**: Remember to **build fable-library files beforehand**. This can be done just by building the whole project (see "Building" above) or running the `FableLibrary` FAKE target (after this, if you edit one of the src/js/fable-library JS or TS files, you can run the `FableLibraryTypescriptOnly` which is faster).\n\n## Contributing\n\nJust by using Fable you\'re already contributing! You can help a lot the community by sharing examples and experiences in your personal blog and sending a PR to [fable-awesome](https://github.com/kunjee17/awesome-fable).\n\nSend bug reports (ideally with minimal code to reproduce the problem) and feature requests to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable/issues). To interact with the community you can use the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/fable-compiler/Fable) but please note maintainers are not checking the chat regularly.\n\nIf you are up to contribute a fix or a feature yourself, you\'re more than welcome! Please send first an issue or a minimal Work In Progess PR so we can discuss the implementation details in advance.\n'
