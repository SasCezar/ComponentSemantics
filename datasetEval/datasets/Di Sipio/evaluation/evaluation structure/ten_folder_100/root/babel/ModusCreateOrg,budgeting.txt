Perceived performance and development experience are key factors in this setup. You can use this code base for learning or to scaffold your mission-critical project.\n\n[See live demo](https://budget.modus.app/).\n\n![React Budgeting App](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/733074/25340900/6ab1d536-2907-11e7-8083-b78f8ae601b4.png)\n\n## Budgeting Application\n\nThis is a simple budget management application. It tracks inflow and outflow, shows remaining budget, and interesting reports with charts. As such, it offers more features than the usual Todo App.\n\nBudgeting app is a showcase project that demonstrates important decisions in architecture and development of a modern React application.\n\nFeel free to use it as a reference app or a starter kit.\n\n## Key concepts:\n\n- [x] [Webpack 4 Tree shaking](http://moduscreate.com/webpack-2-tree-shaking-configuration/)\n- [x] [PRPL pattern](https://www.slideshare.net/grgur/prpl-pattern-with-webpack-and-react) with minimal application core\n- [x] Automatic code splitting with React Router 4 and `import()` statement\n- [x] Automatic common chunk bundling\n- [x] CSS modules\n- [x] Snapshot testing with Jest\n- [x] Flow static typing. Check out this [guide to using Flow in the project](https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/budgeting-sample-app-webpack2/blob/master/docs/flow.md).\n- [x] Performance budgets in Webpack 3\n- [x] React 16 Error Boundaries\n\n## Performance\n\n![Budgeting App Performance](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/733074/25339194/1af94448-2902-11e7-8982-c1a9b647fac0.png)\n_The app loads in 1 second on 3G, cache disabled_\n\nBudgeting app is **blazing fast**, thanks to the smart architecture and Webpack 3 configuration. It takes about 1000ms (1s) to load on 3G (see above).\n\n![Alex Russel Test](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/733074/25586449/acf14628-2e9f-11e7-8839-2f7c20809581.png)\n_Emerging Markets 3G Filmstrip_\n\nThe [aggressive test](https://www.webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=170501_0S_XQ5-r:2-c:0) above shows the budgeting app loads in under 5 seconds. It\'s a heavily limited connection that accounts for poor connectivity and limited bandwidth.\n\n![Waterfall](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/733074/25586623/676a378a-2ea0-11e7-9342-c040751b6ec6.png)\n\nAll important (aka critical path) assets are loaded as early as possible, while the others (e.g. images or GitHub buttons) will load after the first render.\n\n#### How did we get that performance?\n\n1.  **Minimal application core.** We decided to ditch the usual convention of creating a vendor chunk. Instead, it\'s bundled in the app core. The app core is actually very small, containing just the code needed to bootstrap the app.\n2.  **Common code is a chunk.** We let Webpack figure out which bundles we reuse in chunks and create a common chunk that\'s also asyncronous.\n3.  **Redux module injection**. Each chunk contains respective views _and_ redux modules. Yes, that means reducers, action creators, actions - are all dynamically injected as we navigate through routes. That adds to the _minimal application core_ concept and PRPL pattern.\n4.  **H2 Push.** The app is hosted on Firebase and we use the magic of _HTTP2 Push_ to push some of the scripts before they are requested.\n5.  **Pre-caching**. Service Workers pre-cache resources so the browser can access them as soon as the user needs to.\n\n## Charts\n\nCharts are developed using the awesome D3 library. The idea behind showing charts is not only to show beautiful content, but also to demonstrate keeping heavy content in a chunk that owns it. In other words - we show how applications can run fast even if they use larger libraries.\n\nD3 is used in the `/reports` route only. Given that major routes are separate chunks (code splitting FTW!), the entire D3 library is bundled with the code that needs it. That makes the `/reports` route a bit heavier than the initial `/budget` route, but it also makes routes much faster to load.\n\n## Performance Budgets\n\nWe are looking to maintain the lightest possible application core (_aka entry chunk_). Our target is 300kB for the entrypoint and 300kB for all other assets. This is how we set it in [webpack configuration](https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/budgeting-sample-app-webpack2/blob/master/webpack.config.js):\n\n```js\nperformance: {\n  maxAssetSize: 300000,\n  maxEntrypointSize: 300000,\n  hints: \'warning\',\n},\n```\n\nAdding lots of extra code to the entry chunk might cause the build (`npm run build`) process to show a warning.\n\n![Performance Budgets](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/733074/25352700/3ade5cfa-292d-11e7-8d2e-fed88c2c4da0.png)\n\n_Simulated size warning_\n\nNote that running webpack dev server in production mode (`npm run prod`) will trigger this warning because of the additional dev server code injected in the app. This code will not show in regular production builds.\n\n## Service Workers\n\nService workers are enabled only when serving static files, not through webpack-dev-server. Here\'s how you can test service worker functionality:\n\n1.  Run `npm run build` to build the app\n2.  Run `npm run prod` to serve the app on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\n3.  Run a new instance of Chrome with disabled security (because localhost is not on https):\n\n**OS X**\n\n```bash\nopen -a "Google Chrome" --args --user-data-dir=/tmp/unsafe --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://localhost\n```\n\n**Linux**\n\n```bash\n/path/to/chrome --user-data-dir=/tmp/unsafe --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://localhost\n```\n\n**Windows**\n\n```bash\nchrome.exe --user-data-dir=c:\\temp --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://localhost\n```\n\n4.  Now you can observe network traffic in the Network tab or SW activity in Application > Service Workers in Developer Tools\n\n## Stack\n\nThe app was built using these aweseome technologies\n\n- [x] [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org)\n- [x] [React 16.x](https://facebook.github.io/react/)\n- [x] [Redux 3.x](http://redux.js.org/)\n- [x] [React Router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)\n- [x] [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect/)\n- [x] [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)\n- [x] [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)\n- [x] [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)\n- [x] [Flow](https://flow.org/en/)\n- [x] [Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux/) \xf0\x9f\x90\xa3\n- [x] [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)\n- [x] [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)\n- [x] [D3 5.x](https://d3js.org/)\n\n## NPM Scripts\n\n- `npm install` - install dependencies\n- `npm start` - run development server\n- `npm run prod` - run production server\n- `npm run build` - build app for deployment\n- `npm run serve` - serve previously built app using pushstate server\n- `npm run lint` - lint check\n- `npm run lint:fix` - lint check + autofixes + prettify code with **prettier**\n- `npm test` - run test suite\n- `npm run test:fix` - run test suite watching files for changes\n- `npm run flow` - run flow type checking\n- `npm run update-types` - update flow library definitions\n\n## Honorary Mentions\n\n- Thanks to [React experts at Modus Create](https://moduscreate.com), particularly [Tim Eagan](https://twitter.com/TimothyEagan), [Jason Malfatto](https://twitter.com/jmalfatto), [Brice Mason](https://twitter.com/bricemason), and [Esteban Las](https://twitter.com/elas78) for infinite amounts of experience poured into this app\n- Kudos to [Andrea Grisogono](https://twitter.com/scrumolina) who Scrumorganized the team\n- Thanks to community contributors who helped with code and screamed about issues.
