Webpack is the new standard for bundling JS which [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) wasn\'t capable of. Thankfully Webpack can both run tasks and bundle js \xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\n\nThe goal of this project/boilerplate is to reach the following people:\n\n1. __The beginners__ \xf0\x9f\x91\xb6 \xe2\x80\x94 who although use Gulp/Webpack/Node/Npm still need more thorough explainations than the more acquainted developers. They want things to work, but they want to know _how_ and _why_ as well.\n2. __The side-project hustlers__ \xf0\x9f\x8f\x83\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f \xe2\x80\x94 those with all the great ideas but don\'t want to waste time with setup.

Everyone\'s a little different, I understand.\n\n___\n\n# Usage\n\nYou need [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer before running.\n\n1. `git clone https://github.com/tr1s/tris-webpack-boilerplate.git your-project-name`\n2. `cd your-project-name && rm -rf .git`\n3. `npm install`\n4. `npm start`\n\nYou\'re all set, start coding \xf0\x9f\x91\xa9\xe2\x80\x8d\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb\xf0\x9f\x91\xa8\xe2\x80\x8d\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb !\n\nRemove everything in the `src/styles/` folder, `src/index.html` and `src/index.scss/` if you\'d like to start 100% fresh and/or create your own Sass worklow. I based my folder structure off the [7-1 pattern](https://vanseodesign.com/css/sass-directory-structures/).\n\n5. `npm run build` when you\'re ready to upload your site to your FTP / hosting platform of choice. This will create a `dist` folder with all your website assets optimized and compressed.\n\n__If you\'d like an in-depth explaination as to how everything works, please read about the features below.__ Otherwise, carry on coding and have fun :)\n\n___\n___\n___\n___\n\n# Features / Contents\n\n- [Webpack Config Split](#wcs)\n- [Webpack Development Server](#wds)\n- [HTML assets + minification](#html)\n- [404 page](#fourohfour)\n- [SCSS to CSS + optimizations](#sass)\n- [ES6 transpiling](#es6)\n- [Browserslist](#browser)\n- [Image assets + compression](#img)\n- [Font loading + preloading](#font)\n- [Asset compression (gzip)](#gzip)\n- [Clean Webpack Plugin](#cwp)\n- [Sourcemaps](#source)\n- [Favicon generation](#favi)\n- [Offline-first + caching](#offline)\n- [Progressive Web App (PWA)](#progressive)\n- [Gotcha\'s](#gotcha)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n<a name="wcs"/></a>\n___\n\n# Features Explained\n\n### Webpack Config Split\n\nInstead of having one big `webpack.config.js`, we\'ll split our production and development builds into two new configs called `webpack.dev.js` and `webpack.prod.js`. Configurations we want on both development and production will go in the `webpack.common.js` config.\n\nWhen we run `npm start`, it will run the development build based off the `webpack.dev.js` config which also has the merged `webpack.common.js` configurations. Read more about this in the [Webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/).\n\n```js\n/* wenpack.dev.js */\n\nconst merge = require(\'webpack-merge\');\nconst common = require(\'./webpack.common.js\');\n\n/* merges the webpack.common.js and then you add your extra */\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  mode: \'development\',\n  /* the rest of code goes here */\n});\n```\n\nWhen we run `npm run build`, it will run the production build based off the `webpack.prod.js` config which also has the merged `webpack.common.js` configurations.\n\n```js\n/* webpack.prod.js */\n\nconst merge = require(\'webpack-merge\');\nconst common = require(\'./webpack.common.js\');\n\n/* merges the webpack.common.js and then you add your extra */\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  mode: \'production\',\n});\n```\n\nWe want our development and production builds to produce the same results visually in the browser. You don\'t want to finish coding, run the build, and then have a totally different website on build with missing images for example. That\'s why we have `webpack.common.js` to handle all the loaders and asset management. The `webpack.dev.js` will be slightly different with a lighter weight sourcemap. Finally the `webpack.prod.js` will handle all the final stages of getting your website to production. That being image compression, asset compression (gzip), asset minification, favicon generation, caching, and creating an offline-first experience.\n\nI\'ll go into each process below.\n\n<a name="wds"/></a>\n___\n\n### Webpack Development Server\n\nThe webpack-dev-server is configured in the package.json. `npm start` will run the server and open your project in the browser using the `webpack.dev.js` config. `npm start` is npm\'s default script, so you don\'t need to add `run` to it. But for the build script you need to type `npm run build`.\n\n```json\n"scripts": {\n  "start": "webpack-dev-server --open --config webpack.dev.js",\n  "build": "webpack --config webpack.prod.js"\n},\n```\n\n<a name="html"/></a>\n___\n\n### HTML assets and minification\n\nWe use the [html-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-loader) to export HTML as a string and minify the output. This allows you to import your `src/index.html` within your `src/index.js`. We can simply minify the HTML with a loader option `minimize: true`, so this is why we leave it in the `webpack.common.js` instead of moving it to `webpack.prod.js`.\n\n```js\n/* webpack.common.js */\n\n{\n  test: /\\.html$/,\n  use: [{\n    loader: \'html-loader\',\n    options: {\n      minimize: true\n    }\n  }]\n},\n```\n\n```js\n/* src/index.js */\n\nimport \'./index.html\';\n```\n\nWe then use [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) to create a new generated `index.html` with all the correct asset imports.\n\nThe `template:` option is where you\'re pulling your source HTML from. You can use your own html template, [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, [or any of these other templates](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/blob/master/docs/template-option.md).\n\nThe `inject:` option is where your assets will go. Webpack will put your bundled `webpack-bundle.js` script at the bottom of the body by default, but here I switched it to `head` because we\'ll be using the [script-ext-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/numical/script-ext-html-webpack-plugin) to add a `defer` attribute to the script and place it in the head of the website. [This helps with performance](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-async-defer/).\n\n```js\n/* webpack.common.js */\n\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(\'html-webpack-plugin\');\nconst ScriptExtHtmlWebpackPlugin = require("script-ext-html-webpack-plugin");\n\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n    title: \'tris-webpack-boilerplate\',\n    filename: \'index.html\',\n    template: \'./src/index.html\',\n    inject: \'head\'\n  }),\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n    title: \'tris-404-page\',\n    filename: \'404.html\',\n    template: \'./src/404.html\',\n    inject: \'head\'\n  }),\n  new ScriptExtHtmlWebpackPlugin({\n    defaultAttribute: \'defer\'\n  }),\n],\n```\n\nKeep adding more `new HtmlWebpackPlugin({})` plugins if you\'re going to have a multipage website. Name the page appropriately with the `title:` key.\n\n<a name="fourohfour"></a>\n___\n\n### 404 page not found\n\n[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a fantastic free service that let\'s you manage and deploy your websites. Netlify automatically searches for a `404.html` and will load that page when someone tries to open a broken link on your website. So there\'s nothing for you to worry about.\n\nIf you use a different service, please do some research on how you can link your `404.html` page so that it\'s active. It\'s a great way to send people back to your main page if they land on a broken link.\n\n<a name="sass"/></a>\n___\n\n### SCSS to CSS + optimizations\n\nIn order to use Sass/SCSS, we need to use a few loaders to get our desired results. The [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader), [postcss-loader](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader), and the [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader).\n\n`test:` is using regex ([regular expression](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Regular_expression)) to check for any sass, scss, or css files and then runs them through these three loaders, which is wrapped around [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin), which then generates a single CSS file for you to use in production.\n\nRead more about [the concept of loaders](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/).\n\n```js\n/* webpack.common.js */\n{\n  test: /\\.(sa|sc|c)ss$/,\n  use: [\n    MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,\n    {\n      loader: \'css-loader\',\n      options: {\n        sourceMap: true\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      loader: \'postcss-loader\',\n      options: {\n        sourceMap: true\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      loader: \'sass-loader\',\n      options: {\n        sourceMap: true\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n},\n```\n\nThe second part of the loader sequence, the `postcss-loader`, that\'s where you\'ll be minifying and autoprefixing your css. To do this we create a `postcss.config.js` at the root of the project and configure it like so...\n\n```js\n/* postcss.config.js */\n\nconst purgecss = require(\'@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss\');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    require(\'autoprefixer\'),\n    require(\'cssnano\')({\n        preset: \'default\',\n    }),\n    purgecss({\n      content: [\'./**/*.html\'],\n      keyframes: true\n    })\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nRead up on [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) to configure it more to your liking if need be. Additionally read up on [postcss](http://julian.io/some-things-you-may-think-about-postcss-and-you-might-be-wrong/) in general as it is a very powerful tool to have in your arsenal.\n\n[Purgecss](https://www.purgecss.com/) is a fantastic postcss plugin for getting rid of unused css in your code. Purgecss analyzes your content and your css files. Then it matches the selectors used in your files with the one in your content files. It removes unused selectors from your css, resulting in smaller css files.\n\nIt\'s ready to go by default, but if you\'d like to visually test it out for yourself, uncomment `@import "../node_modules/bulma/bulma";` in `index.scss`, and then run `npm run build` and take a look at the resulting `webpack-bundle.css` in your dist folder. You\'ll notice there isn\'t that much code. Then remove the purgecss from your `postcss.config.js` and run `npm run build` again, you\'ll notice there\'s 10,000+ lines of code in your css coming from the [Bulma](http://bulma.io) framework. As you can see, purgecss is perfect for getting rid of CSS you\'re not using when using big frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma, etc!\n\nThe [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin) is the final step as it extracts the CSS and gives it a name before being output.\n\n```js\n/* webpack.common.js */\n\nconst MiniCssExtractPlugin = require("mini-css-extract-plugin");\n\n\nplugins: [\n  new MiniCssExtractPlugin({\n    filename: \'webpack-bundle.css\',\n    chunkFilename: \'[id].css\'\n  })\n],\n```\n\nSo basically... the `css-loader` will collect CSS from all the css files referenced in your application and put them into a string. Then `postcss-loader` autoprefixes and minifies your styles, then `sass-loader` turns it into a JS module, then `mini-css-extract-plugin` extracts the CSS from the JS module into a single CSS file for the web browser to parse.\n\n<a name="es6"/></a>\n___\n\n### ES6 transpiling\n\nYou may want to use the latest JavaScript features and syntax, but not all browsers support them yet. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) will handle that for us.\n\nHere we are testing for all js files but excluding the `node_modules` folder, then running it through the [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) with the [babel-preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) preset.\n\n```js\n/* webpack.common.js */\n\n{\n  test: /\\.js$/,\n  exclude: /(node_modules)/,\n  use: {\n    loader: \'babel-loader\',\n    options: {\n      presets: [\'@babel/preset-env\']\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis time we\'re venturing into the `webpack.prod.js` file. When we `npm run build`, our output js will be minified and have full sourcemaps. Running in dev mode via `npm start` we\'ll still have lighter sourcemaps but the js will not be minified.\n\n```js\n/* webpack.prod.js */\n\nconst TerserPlugin = require(\'terser-webpack-plugin\');\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  mode: \'production\',\n  devtool: \'source-map\',\n  optimization: {\n    minimizer: [\n      new TerserPlugin({\n        test: /\\.js(\\?.*)?$/i,\n        parallel: true,\n        sourceMap: true,\n      })\n    ]\n  },\n});\n```\n\nRead more about the options in the [terser documentation](https://github.com/terser-js/terser).\n\n<a name="browser"/></a>\n___\n\n### Browserslist\n\nHere we want to have one place where we can tell certain tools what browsers we\'d like to add support for. We acheive this using [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist), and the corresponding `.browserslistrc` file in the project root. [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and [babel-present-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) will pick up on this file and apply what it needs to based on the config.\n\nRead up on what else you can pass into `.browserslistrc` and use [browserl.ist](https://browserl.ist/) to see what browsers will specifically be targeted with your config. Okay I think I\'ve said browsers enough times now \xf0\x9f\x98\x8c.\n\n```json\n/* .browserslistrc */\n\n> 0.25%\nnot dead\n```\n\n<a name="img"/></a>\n___\n\n### Image assets + compression\n\nFirst we test for jpeg, jpg, png, gif, and svg using regex ([regular expression](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Regular_expression)), then we use [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader), which resolves imports and requires of a file into a url then emits the file into the output directory. So if you\'re using an `<img>` element that grabs a file from the `src/images` folder, it will be imported and emited to the specified output path `images`. Which ends up being `src/images` if you `npm start` (running dev), or `npm run build` (running build).\n\n```js\n/* webpack.common.js */\n\n{\n  test: /\\.(jpe?g|png|gif|svg)$/,\n  use: [{\n    loader: \'file-loader\',\n    options: {\n      name: \'[name].[ext]\',\n      outputPath: \'images/\',\n      publicPath: \'images/\'\n    },\n  }]\n},\n```\n\nNow we only want to optimize our images on `npm run build`, so we edit our `webpack.prod.js` like so below.\n\nAgain we test for jpeg, jpg, png, gif, and svg using regex, and apply the appropriate optimizations. `gifsicle` is a lossless gif compressor, `pngquant` is a lossy png compressor, and we can add an extra plugin called `imageminMozjpeg` to perform lossy jpg/jpeg compression. A safe bet is setting the quality between 75-90 and you should get some decent compression without loss in visible quality.\n\nI suggest sticking to the lossless compression, and cropping your images to their right size before adding to your project. Just remove the imageminMozjpeg and pngquant key sections to do so.\n\nYou can also use [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) for image compression.\n\n```js\n/* webpack.prod.js */\n\nconst ImageminPlugin = require(\'imagemin-webpack-plugin\').default;\nconst imageminMozjpeg = require(\'imagemin-mozjpeg\');\n\nplugins: [\n  new ImageminPlugin({\n    test: /\\.(jpe?g|png|gif|svg)$/i,\n    gifsicle: { // lossless gif compressor\n      optimizationLevel: 9\n    },\n    pngquant: ({ // lossy png compressor, remove for default lossless\n      quality: \'75\'\n    }),\n    plugins: [imageminMozjpeg({ // lossy jpg compressor, remove for default lossless\n      quality: \'75\'\n    })]\n  }),\n]\n```\n\n<a name="font"></a>\n___\n\n### Font loading + preloading\n\nHere we are testing for all the common font extensions and using the [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader) again to resolve our font imports and output them.\n\n```js\n/* webpack.common.js */\n\n{\n  test: /\\.(woff|woff2|ttf|otf)$/,\n  use: [{\n    loader: \'file-loader\',\n    options: {\n      name: \'[name].[ext]\',\n      outputPath: \'fonts/\',\n      publicPath: \'fonts/\'\n    },\n  }]\n},\n```\n\nIn our `src/styles/base/_typography.scss` we are loading the fonts via the `@font-face` rule. [Google Webfonts Helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) is also a fantastic tool for self-hosting Google Fonts hassle-free. Read more about the `@font-face` rule on [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/). Additionally, read up on the [font-display](https://css-tricks.com/font-display-masses/) property as well.\n\nIt\'s always best practice to preload your fonts. We\'ll acheive that using the [preload-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/preload-webpack-plugin), and you\'ll need to put it right after the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` for it to work properly.\n\n```js\n/* webpack.common.js */\n\nnew PreloadWebpackPlugin({\n  rel: \'preload\',\n  as(entry) {\n    if (/\\.(woff|woff2|ttf|otf)$/.test(entry)) return \'font\';\n  },\n  fileWhitelist: [/\\.(woff|woff2|ttf|otf)$/],\n  include: \'allAssets\'\n}),\n```\n\n<a name="gzip"></a>\n___\n\n### Asset compression\n\nHere we are back in the `webpack.prod.js` config using the [compression-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/compression-webpack-plugin) to compress _only_ the html, css, and javascript files. This is to avoid compressing the sourcemap files that get generated.\n\n```js\n/* webpack.prod.js */\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  mode: \'production\',\n  plugins: [\n    new CompressionPlugin({\n      test: /\\.(html|css|js)(\\?.*)?$/i // only compressed html/css/js, skips compressing sourcemaps etc\n    }),\n});\n```\n\n<a name="cwp"/></a>\n___\n\n### Clean Webpack Plugin\n\n[Clean-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin) is just a simple webpack plugin to remove/clean your build folder(s) before building a new one. Watch your folder scruture as you run `npm run build` or `npm start`. Your current `dist` folder (if you previously had one built) will be deleted and a new one will appear immediately after.\n\n```js\n/* webpack.common.js */\n\nconst CleanWebpackPlugin = require(\'clean-webpack-plugin\');\n\nplugins: [\nnew CleanWebpackPlugin([\'dist\']),\n]\n```\n\n<a name="source"></a>\n___\n\n### Sourcemaps\n\nUsing sourcemaps is essential for debugging your code in the dev tools.\n\nAs you can see when you `npm start` and open up devtools in Chrome then click the console, you\'ll see that there are two console.logs coming from `script.js` line 1 and 2. We can easily see this in our folder structure at `src/scripts/script.js`. If we didn\'t use sourcemaps then devtools would show us these console.logs are coming from our bundled `webpack-bundle.js`, which isn\'t very helpful.\n\nSimilar case with our styles. If you take a look at the `body` element in devtools, you\'ll see some styles being applied from our `_global.scss` file, and some from our `_typography.scss` file, which are both located in our `src/styles/base/` folder. We wouldn\'t be able to know this if we left out sourcemaps. It would just show us the styles came from our bundled `webpack-bundle.css`.\n\n```js\n/* webpack.dev.js */\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  mode: \'development\',\n  devtool: \'inline-source-map\',\n});\n```\n\n```js\n/* webpack.prod.js */\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  mode: \'production\',\n  devtool: \'source-map\',\n});\n```\n\nRead up more on the [different kinds of sourcemaps](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/11/01/webpack-source-map-options-quick-guide.html) to find what works best for your project. Additionally read up on the [devtool](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/) option in the webpack docs.\n\n<a name="favi"></a>\n___\n\n### Favicon generation\n\nThis is a great plugin that generates every single icon you\'ll ever need based off one image source. In my `src/images/` folder I have a `tris-package.svg` that I input into the [favicons-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin).\n\nIt will generate icons for apple, android, chrome, firefox, twitter, windows, you name it. It will generate each icon in all different sizes and import them directly into your website head where they belong. Twitter and windows are set to false but default, so I changed them to true just to cover all the bases just in-case.\n\n__Note: this dramatically increases the build time. Which is understandable considering how much it is doing under the hood and how much time it is saving you in the long run. Don\'t be surprised if your `npm run build` takes 20 seconds longer than usual.__\n\n```js\n/* webpack.prod.js */\n\nconst FaviconsWebpackPlugin = require(\'favicons-webpack-plugin\');\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  mode: \'production\',\n  plugins: [\n    new FaviconsWebpackPlugin({\n      logo: \'./src/images/favicon.svg\',\n      icons: {\n        twitter: true,\n        windows: true\n      }\n    }),\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n<a name="offline"></a>\n___\n\n### Offline first and caching\n\nHere we use the [offline-plugin](https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin) plugin to cache all of our assets on page load.\n\nThis plugin is intended to provide an offline experience for __webpack__ projects. It uses __ServiceWorker__, and __AppCache__ as a fallback under the hood. We simply include this plugin in our `webpack.prod.js`, and the accompanying runtime in our client script (src/index.js), and our project will become offline ready by caching all (or some) of the webpack output assets.\n\n__Note: If you `npm run build` and upload your changes to your server (or however you keep your website updated), your website will need to have been closed and re-opened before you see the changes. You can\'t have it open and keep refreshing, you need to close the tab and re-open it for the cache to bust.__\n\n```js\n/* webpack.prod.js */\n\nconst OfflinePlugin = require(\'offline-plugin\');\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  mode: \'production\',\n  plugins: [\n    new OfflinePlugin()\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n<a name="progressive"/></a>\n___\n\n### Progressive Web App (PWA)\n\n[Progressive web applications](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) (PWAs) are web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user functionality such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access traditionally available only to native applications. PWAs combine the flexibility of the web with the experience of a native application.\n\nThe final step to make this boilerplate a PWA is to add the mandatory [Web App Manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/) to the root of your project and configure it appropriately!\n\n<a name="gotcha"/></a>\n___\n\n# Gotcha\'s\n\nWebpack runs into issues when trying to bundle big libraries like jQuery. You\'ll end up with console errors like `$ is not defined` or `jQuery is not defined`. To solve this we let Webpack treat it as an external. We then define the variables and include jQuery via a CDN. Most people have jQuery cached on their browser regardless so this won\'t be an issue in terms of performance. I\'ve added the `externals:` config by default, but you\'ll have to add the [jQuery cdn](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery/) by yourself if you plan to use it.\n\nRead more about externals in the [Webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/).\n\n```js\n/* webpack.common.js */\n\nplugins: [],\nexternals: {\n  $: \'jquery\',\n  jquery: \'jQuery\',\n  \'window.$\': \'jquery\',\n}\n```\n\n```html\n/* src/index.html */\n\n<head>\n  <script defer src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>\n</head>\n```\n\n<a name="contributing"/></a>\n___\n\n# Contributing\n\nI try my best to explain things thoroughly, but if something can be explained more clearly, please feel free to send off a pull request with some suggested edits.
