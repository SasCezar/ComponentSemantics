b'# What is Iconify?\n\nIconify project makes it easy to add SVG icons to websites and offers over 40,000 icons to choose from.\n\nThere are many fonts and SVG sets available, but they all have one thing in common: using any font or SVG set limits you\nto icons that are included in that set and forces browsers to load entire font or icons set. That limits developers to\none or two fonts or icon sets.\n\nIconify project uses new innovative approach to loading icons. Unlike fonts and SVG frameworks, Iconify only loads\nicons that are used on page instead of loading entire fonts. How is it done? By serving icons dynamically from publicly\navailable JSON API (you can make a copy of script and API if you prefer to keep everything on your servers).\n\nIconify is designed to be as easy to use as possible.\n\nAdd this line to your page to load Iconify (you can add it to ```<head>``` section of page or before ```</body>```):\n\n```\n<script src="https://code.iconify.design/1/1.0.3/iconify.min.js"></script>\n```\nor\n```\n<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@iconify/iconify@1.0.3/dist/iconify.min.js"></script>\n```\nor if you are building project with something like WebPack, you can include script by installing @iconify/iconify as dependency and importing it in your project:\n```\nimport Iconify from \'@iconify/iconify\';\n```\n\n\nTo add any icon, write something like this: \n\n```\n<span class="iconify" data-icon="fa-home"></span>\n```\nor this:\n```\n<iconify-icon class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-home"></iconify-icon>\n```\n\nSample:\n    \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Sample](https://iconify.design/samples/icon2.png)\n\nThat is it. Change data-icon value to name of icon you want to use. There are over 40,000 premade icons to choose from,\nincluding FontAwesome, Material Design Icons, Entypo+ and even several emoji sets.\n\nDo you want to make your own icon sets? Tools for making custom icon sets are available on GitHub. See documentation.\n\n## Customizing color, dimensions, transformations\n\n### Color\n\nThere are 2 types of icons: monotone and colored.\n\n* Monotone icons are icons that use only 1 color. All icons from glyph fonts fall into this category: FontAwesome,\nGlyphIcons, Material Design Icons, etc.\n* Colored icons are icons that use preset palette. Most emoji icons fall into this category: Noto Emoji, Emoji One,\netc. You cannot change palette for those icons.\n\nMonotone icons use font color, just like glyph fonts. To change color you can do this:\n\n```\n<span class="iconify icon-bell" data-icon="vaadin-bell"></span>\n```\n    \nand add this to css:\n\n```\n.icon-bell {\n    color: #f80;\n}\n.icon-bell:hover {\n    color: #f00;\n}\n```\n\nSample:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Sample](https://iconify.design/samples/icon-color.png)\n\n\n### Dimensions\n\nBy default all icons are scaled to 1em height. To control icon height use font-size:\n\n```\n<span class="iconify icon-clipboard" data-icon="emojione-clipboard"></span>\n```\n    \nand add this to css:\n\n```\n.icon-clipboard {\n    font-size: 32px;\n}\n```\n\nSample:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Sample](https://iconify.design/samples/icon-size.png)\n    \n    \nyou might also need to set line-height:\n\n```\n.icon-clipboard {\n    font-size: 32px;\n    line-height: 1em;\n}\n```\n\nYou can also set custom dimensions using data-width and data-height attributes:\n\n```\n<span data-icon="twemoji-ice-cream" data-width="32" data-height="32" class="iconify"></span>\n```\n\nSample:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Sample](https://iconify.design/samples/icon-size2.png)\n\n\n### Vertical alignment\n\nTrouble with using images in text is they are aligned at baseline. Glyph fonts don\'t have that issue because\nthey are rendered as fonts, vertically centered slightly below baseline so they look nicely aligned in text.\n\nTo solve that issue Iconify adds vertical alignment to all icons, placing them below baseline, so icons behave\nsimilar to glyph fonts, fitting perfectly into text.\n\nBut what if you don\'t want that behavior? What if you want Iconify icons to behave like images? There are several\nsolutions, use whichever you prefer:\n\n1. Using iconify-icon tag instead of span:\n```\n<iconify-icon data-icon="noto-frog-face"></iconify-icon>\n```\niconify-icon tag is equal to using class="iconify" on any other element, but by default inline mode is disabled, so icon\nwill not have preset vertical-alignment style, behaving like normal image.\n\n2. Adding data-inline attribute:\n```\n<span class="iconify" data-icon="noto-frog-face" data-inline="false"></span>\n```\n\n3. Removing vertical-alignment via css:\n```\n.iconify {\n    vertical-align: baseline !important;\n}\n```\n\nSample:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Sample](https://iconify.design/samples/icon-baseline.png)\n\n\n### Transformations\n\nYou can rotate and flip icon by adding data-flip and data-rotate attributes:\n\n```\n<span data-icon="twemoji-helicopter" class="iconify" data-flip="horizontal"></span>\n<span data-icon="twemoji-helicopter" class="iconify" data-rotate="90deg"></span>\n```\n    \nPossible values for data-flip: horizontal, vertical.\nPossible values for data-rotate: 90deg, 180deg, 270deg.\n\nIf you use both flip and rotation, icon is flipped first, then rotated.\n\nTo use custom transformations use css transform rule. Add !important after rule to override svg style.\n\n```\n<span data-icon="twemoji-helicopter" class="iconify icon-helicopter"></span>\n```\n```\n.icon-helicopter {\n    transform: 45deg !important;\n}\n```\n\nSamples:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Sample](https://iconify.design/samples/icon-transform.png)\n\n\n# Using Iconify in stylesheets\n\nOne useful feature of glyph fonts is ease of use in stylesheets. Usually it is done by adding pseudo selector like this:\n\n```\n.foo:after {\n    content: \'\\f030\';\n    font-family: FontAwesome;\n}\n```\n\nIts a bit harder to do with SVG. There are 2 options:\n* Using SVG as pseudo element\'s content\n* Using SVG as background image\n\nBoth options use external image generated by Iconify API. Iconify API can create SVG for any image in collection. You can use it like this:\n\n```\n.foo {\n    background: url(\'https://api.iconify.design/emojione-ice-skate.svg\') no-repeat center center / contain;\n}\n```\n\nor like this:\n```\n.bar:after {\n    content: url(\'https://api.iconify.design/emojione-ice-skate.svg?height=16\');\n}\n```\n\nNotice "height" attribute in second example. You must specify height if you are using SVG as psedo element\'s content, that\'s the only way to resize it. You can also set width parameter, but its not needed because if you set height, width will be calculated by Iconify API using original icon\'s width/height ratio.\n\nExamples above use emoji that has preset color palette. What about monotone icons? SVG cannot inherit color from DOM when used as external resource. That means you need to specify color value. To specify color, add color parameter:\n\n```\n.foo {\n    background: url("https://api.iconify.design/mdi-account.svg?color=red") no-repeat center center / contain;\n}\n.bar:after {\n    content: url("https://api.iconify.design/fa-home?height=16&color=%23FF8040");\n}\n```\n\n\nWhere %23FF8040 is URL version of #FF8040. You cannot use # in URL, so you need to replace it with %23\n\nOptional parameters:\n\n* width and height - width and height in pixels. If you set it to "auto", original SVG dimensions will be used. It is enough to set only 1 dimension to "auto", other dimension will be set to "auto" automatically:\n\n```\nhttps://api.iconify.design/fxemoji-star.svg?height=auto\n```\n\n* align - alignment, used when custom width/height ratio does not match original SVG width/height ratio. Values are the\nsame as in data-align attribute mentioned above.\n* flip, rotate - transformations. Same as data-flip and data-rotate mentioned above.\n\n\n# Available icons\n\nThere are over 40,000 icons to choose from.\n\nGeneral collections (monotone icons):\n* [Material Design Icons](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/mdi/) (3000+ icons)\n* [Unicons](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/uil/) (1000+ icons)\n* [Jam Icons](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/jam/) (900 icons)\n* [IonIcons](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/ion/) (700+ icons)\n* [FontAwesome 4](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/fa/) and [FontAwesome 5](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/fa-solid/) (2000+ icons)\n* [Vaadin Icons](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/vaadin/) (600+ icons)\n* [Feather Icon(s)](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/feather/) (600+ icons)\n* [IcoMoon Free](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/icomoon-free/) (400+ icons)\n* [Dashicons](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/dashicons/) (300 icons)\nand many others.\n\nEmoji collections (mostly colored icons):\n* [Emoji One](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/emojione/) (1800+ colored version 2 icons, 1400+ monotone version 2 icons, 1200+ version 1 icons)\n* [Firefox OS Emoji](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/fxemoji/) (1000+ icons)\n* [Noto Emoji](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/noto/) (2000+ icons for version 2, 2000+ icons for version 1)\n* [Twitter Emoji](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/twemoji/) (2000+ icons)\n\nAlso there are several thematic collections, such as weather icons, map icons, etc.\n\nYou can use browse or search available icons on Iconify website: https://iconify.design/icon-sets/\n\nClick any icon to get HTML code.\n\n\n# Iconify vs SVG vs glyph fonts\n\nWhy use Iconify instead of fonts or other frameworks?\n\nThere is a tutorial that explains all differences. See http://iconify.design/docs/iconify-svg-fonts/\n\n\n# Plugins to make migration easier\n\nSome icon sets used in Iconify are imported from glyph fonts. Iconify includes plugins for some of those collections\nthat make it easier to migrate from font library.\n\nBy default Iconify is searching for items with "iconify" class and uses data-icon attribute to get icon name:\n\n    <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-home"></span>\n\nPlugins make Iconify search for other selectors, so you can keep using old library syntax:\n\n    <i class="fa fa-arrow-left"></i>\n\nHow to use plugins? Include plugin script:\n\n    <script src="https://code.iconify.design/1/1.0.3/plugin-fa.min.js"></script>\n\nReplace link to FontAwesome with link to Iconify and link to FontAwesome plugin and you can keep using old FontAwesome\nsyntax in your pages.\n\nHowever it is better to not use plugins for cleaner code.\n\n\n# Browser support\n\nIconify supports all modern browsers.\n\nOld browsers that are supported:\n- IE 9+\n- iOS Safari for iOS 8+\n\nIE 9, 10 and iOS 8 Safari do not support some modern functions that Iconify relies on. Iconify will automatically\nload polyfills for those browsers. All newer browsers do not require those polyfills.\n\n\n# License\n\nIconify is dual-licensed under Apache 2.0 and GPL 2.0 license.
