It supports many keyboard actions and keyboard types and lets you create keyboards with text inputs, emojis, actions, images etc.\n\n<p align="center">\n    <img src ="Resources/Demo.gif" />\n</p>\n\nWith `KeyboardKit`, you inherit `KeyboardInputViewController` instead of `UIInputViewController`. This provides you with a `keyboardActionHandler` that can handle taps, long presses etc. and a `keyboardStackView` to which you can add components like toolbars, button rows and collection views. `KeyboardKit` also provides you with tools for haptic feedback, displaying alerts on top of the keyboard etc.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nThe easiest way to add Sheeeeeeeeet to your project in Xcode 11 is to use Swift Package Manager:\n```\nhttps://github.com/danielsaidi/KeyboardKit.git\n```\n\n### CocoaPods\n\n```ruby\ntarget \'HostApp\' do\n  pod \'KeyboardKit\'\nend\n\ntarget \'KeyboardExt\' do\n  pod \'KeyboardKit\'\nend\n```\n\n### Carthage\n\n```\ngithub "danielsaidi/KeyboardKit"\n```\n\n### Manual installation\n\nTo manually add `KeyboardKit` to your app, clone this repository, add `KeyboardKit.xcodeproj` to your project and `KeyboardKit.framework` as an embedded app binary and target dependency.\n\n\n## Get Started\n\nWith `KeyboardKit`, your input view controllers should inherit from `KeyboardInputViewController` instead of `UIInputViewController`. It has a `keyboardStackView` to which you can add components like toolbars, button rows and even collection views The keuyboard extension will automatically be resized to fit the content of this stack view.\n\n\n## Keyboard Actions\n\n`KeyboardKit` comes with a set of actions that can be applied to your keyboard buttons, like `character`s, `backspace`, `newline`, `space`, `keyboard switcher`s etc.\n\nCheckout [this guide][Keyboard-Actions] for more information about the available actions and how to use them.\n\n\n## Keyboard Types\n\n`KeyboardKit` comes with the following built-in keyboard types:\n\n* `alphabetic(uppercase/lowercase)`\n* `numeric`\n* `symbolic`\n* `email`\n* `emojis`\n* `custom(name)`\n\nThese types are just keyboard representations, without any logic. You can bind them to a keyboard action to add buttons that switches between various keyboard types, but you have to implement the keyboards types yourself.\n\n\n## Components\n\n`KeyboardKit` comes with a set of component protocols that can be combined into complete keyboard, e.g. `vertical and horizontal components`, `buttons`, `button rows` etc.\n\nCheckout [this guide][Components] for more information about the available components and how to use them.\n\n\n## Views\n\n`KeyboardKit` comes with a set of views that implement one or several of the component protocols above, e.g. `vertical and horizontal components`, `buttons`, `button rows` etc.\n\nCheckout [this guide][Views] for more information about the available views and how to use them.\n\n\n## Autocomplete\n\nKeyboardKit supports autocomplete, which means that you can add a toolbar that displays autocomplete suggestions for the currently typed text and replaces text in your text document proxy when you tap a  suggestion. \n\nCheckout [this guide][Autocomplete] for more information about how to implement autocomplete in your keyboard.\n\n\n## Alerts\n\nSince keyboard extensions can\'t display `UIAlertController`s, you can use `KeyboardAlert` to alert messages on top of the keyboard. You can use the built-in `ToastAlert` or create a custom one.\n\n\n## Haptic Feedback\n\n`KeyboardKit` has a `HapticFeedback` type, that can be used to give the user haptic feedback as she/he uses the keyboard.  `HapticFeedback` defines a set of feedback types that wraps native feedback types like `selection changed`, `error`, `success` etc.\n\nYou can enable or disable haptic feedback by providing the `keyboardActionHandler` with a haptic feedback configuration. The default configuration is to disable haptic feedback.\n\n`NOTE` that you have to enable open access for the keyboard for haptic feedback to work.\n\n\n## Audio Feedback\n\n`KeyboardKit` has an `AudioFeedback` type, that can be used to give the user audio feedback as she/he uses the keyboard.  `AudioFeedback` defines a set of feedback types that wraps native system sounds.\n\nYou can enable or disable audio feedback by providing the `keyboardActionHandler` with a audio feedback configuration. The default configuration is to play standard audio feedback.\n\n`NOTE` that you have to enable open access for the keyboard for haptic feedback to work.\n\n\n## Extensions\n\n`KeyboardKit` comes with a bunch of extensions that simplifies working with keyboard extensions. Many are internal and only used within the library, but some are public and can be used to handle common logic, like saving and exporting images. Check out the example app for more information.\n\n\n## Demo Application\n\nThis repository contains a demo app that demonstrates different kinds of keyboards, including:\n\n * Alphabetical (lower + upper-case)\n * Numerical\n * Symbols\n * Emojis\n * Images\n \n To keep the keyboard layout nice, the image switcher key is only displayed on notch devices, since they don\'t have to display a next keyboard button.\n \n You have to enable "full access" in keyboard settings for haptic feedback and the image keyboard to work.\n\nTo run the demo app, open and run the `KeyboardKit.xcodeproj` project.\n\n\n## Contact me\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have questions or if you want to contribute in any way:\n\n* E-mail: [daniel.saidi@gmail.com][Email]\n* Twitter: [@danielsaidi][Twitter]\n* Web site: [danielsaidi.com][Website]\n\n\n## License\n\nKeyboardKit is available under the MIT license.
