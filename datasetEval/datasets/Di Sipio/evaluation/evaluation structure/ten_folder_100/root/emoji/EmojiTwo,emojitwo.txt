b'# Emojione\n\nVersion 2.x of Emojione is no longer supported by [Ranks.com](https://emojione.com). \nVersions 3 and 4 have slightly different desigsn and new, more restrictive licensing terms.\nSome people prefer the flat cartoon design and the FOSS license with actual access to the SVG sources.\n\n# Emojitwo \n\nThe artwork of the second generation of the web\'s first complete open source emoji set. It is and will stay 100% free and open source.\n\n**We need help** from graphic designers to make more glyphs! \nSee the [milestones](https://github.com/EmojiTwo/emojitwo/milestones), [projects](https://github.com/EmojiTwo/emojitwo/projects) and especially the issues tagged [`character artwork`](https://github.com/EmojiTwo/emojitwo/labels/character%20artwork) for details. \nDo not be afraid to ask for assistance, also boldly send pull requests. \nEvery year Uniucode aims to release a couple dozen new emojis. \nSome of them come with gender and skin tone variants, but at least the latter can be generated automatically.\n\n## Differences between Emojitwo and Emojione 2.x\n\nEmojitwo is restricted to the artwork, i.e. image files.\nSVG is its native format. Everything else is derived from that.\n\n### Additions\n\n+ Unicode 9 beta emojis Rifle and Modern Pentathlon have been resurrected: [U+1F946 &#x1f946;](https://github.com/EmojiTwo/emojitwo/blob/master/svg/1f946.svg), [U+1F93B &#x1f93b;](https://github.com/EmojiTwo/emojitwo/blob/master/svg/1f93b.svg).\n+ Flag for deprecated region code `SU`: [U+1F1F8+1F1FA &#x1f1f8;&#x1f1fa](https://github.com/EmojiTwo/emojitwo/blob/master/svg/1f1f8-1f1fa.svg).\n+ More ist listed in the [full changelog](CHANGELOG.md).\n\n### Changes\n\n* Documentation has been updated to\n  1. encourage contributions to the artwork,\n  2. use _Emojitwo_ or _Emoji Two_ instead of _Emojione_ or _Emoji One_ where appropriate.\n* Some minor color optimizations.\n* SVG source code prettified.\n\nSee the documentation for a more [detailed change log](doc/changes).\n\n### Removals\n\n- All programming libraries have been removed. Reusable meta data files will remain.\n\n### Plans\n\nEmojitwo shall eventually include graphics for new emojis:\nhttps://github.com/EmojiTwo/emojitwo/milestones\n  - Emoji characters defined in the [Unicode Standard 10.0]() (June 2017),  [Unicode Standard 11.0]() (June 2018) and later.\n  - Sequences documented in [Unicode Emoji 4.0](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-9.html) (November 2016), [5.0](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-11.html) (March 2017) and later (UTR#51), e.g. flags.\n  - Characters extended in [Unicode Emoji 11.0](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/proposed.html) and later (UTS#51).\n  - Existing Unicode characters without the `Emoji` property, especially to match other vendors (like Microsoft and Samsung).\n  - Custom sequences and alternatives, especially those supported by other vendors.\n\nEmojitwo shall adopt a more restricted color palette. Actual changes will be subtle and barely noticable. This will affect flags.\n\n## Emojione 2.x Artwork License\n\n*  Applies to all PNG and SVG files as well as any adaptations made.\n    *  [License](LICENSE.md): Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\n    *  Human Readable License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n    *  Complete Legal Terms: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\n  \n### Emojione Artwork Attribution\n\nWith the release of version 3.0, the Emojione project also made changes to 2.2.7\xe2\x80\x99s licensing. \n[Previously](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20170327003706/http://emojione.com/licensing/#attribution), Emojione did not require attribution for non-commercial and personal use. Considering that the Emojione project only changed the documentation in that branch to mandate attribution in any case, Emojitwo forked a state before those changes for greater flexibility.\n\nFor **non-commercial** and **personal use**, you *should* credit the creators. \nFor **commercial use**, proper attribution *must* be given on every web page, app, or video description where our emojis are displayed. \n\n### Creative Commons Requirements\n\nIn section 3(a)(1) of the CC-BY 4.0 legal terms, it lists the following as the guidelines needed to fulfill the attribution requirements:\n\n> If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n> - retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n>     - identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n>     - a copyright notice;\n>     - a notice that refers to this Public License;\n>     - a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n>     - a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n> - indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n> - indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License."\n\n### Proper Attribution Examples\n\nMust contain:\n- The original name _Emojione_ (or _Emoji One_) and the forked name _Emojitwo_ (or _Emoji Two_).\n- Links to the repository and Ranks.com\'s website\n    - https://github.com/EmojiTwo/emojitwo/ or https://emojitwo.github.io/emojitwo/\n    - https://www.emojione.com\n- The title and a link to the Creative Commons license\n    - Creative Commons Attribution International 4.0 (CC-BY 4.0)\n    - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\n\nAlso helpful:\n- Make sure it does not look like Ranks.com or the Emojitwo community created or endorsed your product.\n- List all modifications you\'ve made to the artwork. (Also consider to submit them for inclusion.)\n- A reference to Ranks.com as original creators of Emojione.\n\n### Ideal Attribution\n\n> Emoji artwork is provided by [Emojitwo](https://emojitwo.github.io/), \n> originally released as [Emojione 2.2](https://www.emojione.com) by [Ranks.com](http://www.ranks.com)\n> with contributions from the Emojitwo community\n> and is licensed under [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).\n\n### Attribution Location\n\n#### Apps\n- A note with link in the *app store description* is required.\n- Other links and praise are much appreciated:\n    - app settings\n    - official app website\n    - social media\n    \n#### Websites\n- A note with link on *every web page* where our emojis are displayed is required.\n- Other links and praise are much appreciated:\n    - main homepage\n    - social media\n    \n#### Web Videos\n- A note with link in the *video description* is required.\n- Other links and praise are much appreciated:\n    - on-screen when emojis are displayed\n    - on-screen in credits\n    - social media\n\n## Information\n\n### Generating New Sprites\n\nThe sprites are not automatically updated and should be refreshed locally if you plan to use them. To do this, you must have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/),  [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), and [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) installed on your machine. \n\nFrom the root of the project, first install Node modules:\n```$ npm install```\n\nThen generate new sprites and css by executing:\n```grunt```\n*Note:* the ImageOptim process takes a few minutes to optimize the PNG sprite.\n\n### Bug reports\n\nIf you discover any bugs, feel free to create an issue on GitHub.
