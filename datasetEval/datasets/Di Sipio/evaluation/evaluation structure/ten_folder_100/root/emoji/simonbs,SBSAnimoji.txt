b"# SBSAnimoji\n\nFooling around with Apples private framework AvatarKit, the framework used in Messages.app for recording Animoji videos. If you are looking to create your own Animoji, take a look at [SBSCustomAnimoji](https://github.com/simonbs/SBSCustomAnimoji).\n\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/simonbs/SBSAnimoji/raw/master/screenshot.png)\n\n### What you get\n\n- Record Animoji videos of up to 60 seconds. Previously 20 seconds. Thanks, [Khaos Tian](https://github.com/KhaosT)!\n- Share your Animoji videos with the native share sheet.\n- Export videos to your photo library from the native share sheet.\n- An example of how to use Apples AvatarKit.\n\n### What you don't get\n\n- Error handling. Should you encounter an error, try restarting the app.\n- Support for the simulator. Run the app on your phone instead.\n\n# Notice\n\nThis project relies heavily on Apples private API and you should therefore not try to submit this code to App Store.\n"
