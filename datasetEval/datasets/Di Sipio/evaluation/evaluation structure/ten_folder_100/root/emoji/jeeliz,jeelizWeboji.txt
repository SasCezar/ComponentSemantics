b'\n**NOTICE: Apple<sup>&copy;</sup>\'s lawyers threatened us to file a complain on the 21th of August 2019 for infringing their intellectual property. So we have removed our main demo [webojis.com](http://webojis.com) and we have replaced the 3D animated fox by a raccoon.**\n\n**Indead, Apple<sup>&copy;</sup> owns the intellectual property of 3D animated foxes (but not on raccoons yet). Thank you for your understanding.**\n\n\n\n# JavaScript/WebGL library to detect and reproduce facial expressions\n\n\nBuild your own animated emoticon embedded in web applications with this library. The video is processed client-side only. No devices are needed except a standard webcam.\n\nBy default a webcam feedback image is overlaid by the face detection frame. The face detection will adapt to all lighting conditions, but the evaluation of expressions can be noisy if the lighting is too high, too weak, or if there is backlighting. The webcam feedback image is useful to see the quality of the input video feed.\n\nThe computing power of your GPU is important. If your GPU is powerful, many detections per second will be processed and the result will be smooth and accurate. An old or low quality mobile device it may be slower. But it should work well on medium or high end mobile devices.\n\n\n## Table of contents\n\n* [Features](#features)\n* [Architecture](#architecture)\n* [Demonstrations](#demonstrations)\n  * [Run locally](#run-locally)\n  * [Using the ES6 module](#using-the-es6-module)\n* [Hosting](#hosting)\n* [About the tech](#about-the-tech)\n  * [Under the hood](#under-the-hood)\n  * [Compatibility](#compatibility)\n  * [Future improvements](#future-improvements)\n* [Documentation](#documentation)\n* [Need more ?](#need-more)\n* [License](#license)\n* [See also](#see-also)\n* [References](#references)\n\n\n## Features\n\n* face detection and tracking,\n* recognize 11 facial expressions,\n* face rotation along the 3 axis,\n* robust for all lighting conditions,\n* mobile friendly,\n* example provided using SVG and THREE.js.\n\n## Architecture\n\n* `/assets/`: assets, both for 3D and 2D demonstrations (3D meshes, images),\n* `/demos/`: the most interesting: the demos !,\n* `/dist/`: heart of the library:\n  * `jeelizFaceTransfer.js`: main minified script. It gets the webcam video feed, exploit the neural network to detect the face and the expressions and stabilize the result,\n  * `jeelizFaceTransferNNC.json`: neural network model loaded by the main script,\n* `/doc/`: some additionnal documentation,\n* `/helpers/`: The outputs of the main script are very raw. It is convenient to use these helpers to animate a 3D model with the THREE.js helper or a SVG file with the SVG helper. All demos use these helpers,\n* `/libs/`: some javascript libs,\n* `/meshConverter/`: only for the THREE.js use. Tool to build the 3D model file including morphs from separate .OBJ files.\n\n\n## Demonstrations\n\nWe have built a demo application based on this library, available on [webojis.com](http://webojis.com). We have add recording capabilities using [RecordRTC](https://recordrtc.org) JavaScript library to save separately video from the `<canvas>` and audio from the microphone. Then we send them to the server and we encode the video using [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org).\n\nAll the following demos are included in this repository, in the `/demos` path. You can try them:\n\n* THREE.JS based demos:\n\n  * **Cute raccoon**: [source code](/demos/threejs/raccoon/), [live demo](https://jeeliz.com/demos/weboji/demos/threejs/raccoon/)\n  * **Cute raccoon from a MP4 video**: [source code](/demos/threejs/externalVideo/), [live demo](https://jeeliz.com/demos/weboji/demos/threejs/externalVideo/)\n\n* SVG based demos:\n\n  * **Cool Cartman**: [source code](/demos/svg), [live demo](https://jeeliz.com/demos/weboji/demos/svg/)\n\n* Native demos:\n\n  * **Cute raccoon**: [source code and instruction to build and run it](/demos/cordova/raccoon) This demo works as a native application using Apache Cordova. It has been tested successfully on iOS. The base code is the same than the THREE.js raccoon demo.\n\n\n* Third party demos:\n\n  * **Piano Genie**: play the piano with your face expressions! This is pretty addictive ;).

[live demo - vauta.netlify.com](https://vauta.netlify.com/), [tweet and video](https://twitter.com/ke4563/status/1099673171777617922)\n\n  * **Drowsiness detection**, by [Abhilash26](https://github.com/abhilash26) aka [Dinodroid](https://ko-fi.com/dinodroid): Be sure to don\'t fall asleep when driving thanks to this webapp! You can try it here: [dont-drive-drowsy.glitch.me](https://dont-drive-drowsy.glitch.me/), [view the source code](https://github.com/abhilash26/dont-drive-drowsy) or a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjqySZE8CTY)\n\n  * **Expressions reader**, by [Abhilash26](https://github.com/abhilash26) aka [Dinodroid](https://ko-fi.com/dinodroid): detects 5 high level expressions (happiness, fear, anger, surprise, sadness) from the morph coefficients given by this lib, and display them as smileys. You can try it here: [emotion-reader.glitch.me](https://emotion-reader.glitch.me/) or [browse the source code](https://github.com/abhilash26/emotion-reader)\n\n\nIf you have made an application or a fun demonstration using this library, we would love to check it out and add a link here ! Just contact us on [Twitter @StartupJeeliz](https://twitter.com/StartupJeeliz) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jeeliz).\n\n\n#### Run locally\n\nYou just have to serve the content of this directory using a HTTPS server. Webcam access can be not authorized depending on the web browser the application is hosted by an unsecured HTTP server. You can use *Docker* for example to run a HTTPS server:\n\n\n1. Run docker-compose\n\n```\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\n2. Open a browser and go to `localhost:8888`\n\n\nIf you have not bought a webcam yet, a screenshot video of the Cartman Demo is available here:\n\n<p align="center">\n<a href=\'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxaL_kXwtRE\'><img src=\'https://img.youtube.com/vi/WxaL_kXwtRE/0.jpg\'></a>\n</p>\n\n\n\n#### Using the ES6 module\n`/dist/jeelizFaceTransferES6.js` is exactly the same than `/dist/jeelizFaceTransfer.js` except that it works with ES6, so you can import it directly using:\n\n```javascript\nimport \'dist/jeelizFaceTransferES6.js\'\n```\n\nor using `require`:\n\n```javascript\nconst faceTransfer =require(\'./lib/jeelizFaceTransferES6.js\')\n//...\n```\n\nThe demos have not been ported to ES6 yet. You are welcome to submit a pull request :).\n\n\n\n## Hosting\n\nThis library requires the user\'s webcam feed through `MediaStream API`. Your application should then be hosted with a HTTPS server (the certificate can be self-signed). It won\'t work at all with unsecure HTTP, even locally with some web browsers.\n\nBe careful to enable gzip HTTP/HTTPS compression for JSON and JS files. Indeed, the neuron network JSON in, `/dist/` is quite heavy, but very well compressed with GZIP. You can check the gzip compression of your server [here](https://checkgzipcompression.com/).\n\nThe neuron network JSON file is loaded using an ajax `XMLHttpRequest` after the user has accepted to share its camera. We proceed this way to avoid to load this quite heavy file if the user refuses to share its webcam or if there is no webcam available. The loading will be faster if you systematically preload the JSON file using a service worker or a simple raw `XMLHttpRequest` just after the loading of the HTML page. Then the file will be in the browser cache and will be fast to request.\n\n\n\n\n## About the tech\n### Under the hood\nThe heart of the lib is `JEEFACETRANSFERAPI`. It is implemented by `/dist/jeelizFaceTransfer.js` script. It relies on Jeeliz WebGL Deep Learning technology to detect and track the user\'s face using a deep learning network, and to simultaneously evaluate the expression factors. The accuracy is adaptative: the best is the hardware, the more detections are processed per second. All is done client-side.\n\nThe documentation of `JEEFACETRANSFERAPI` is included in this repository as a PDF file, [/doc/jeefacetransferAPI.pdf](/doc/jeefacetransferAPI.pdf). In the main scripts of the demonstration, we never call these methods directly, but always through the helpers. Here is the indices of the morphs returned by this API:\n\n* 0:  smileRight &rarr; closed mouth smile right\n* 1:  smileLeft  &rarr; closed mouth smile left\n* 2:  eyeBrowLeftDown &rarr; eyebrow left frowned\n* 3:  eyeBrowRightDown &rarr; eyebrow right frowned\n* 4:  eyeBrowLeftUp &rarr; eyebrow left up (surprised)\n* 5:  eyeBrowRightUp &rarr; eyebrow right up (surprised)\n* 6:  mouthOpen &rarr; mouth open\n* 7:  mouthRound &rarr; mouth round\n* 8:  eyeRightClose &rarr; close right eye\n* 9:  eyeLeftClose  &rarr; close left eye\n* 10: mouthNasty   &rarr; mouth nasty (upper lip raised)\n\n\n\n### Compatibility\n* If `WebGL2` is available, it uses `WebGL2` and no specific extension is required,\n* If `WebGL2` is not available but `WebGL1`, we require either `OES_TEXTURE_FLOAT` extension or `OES_TEXTURE_HALF_FLOAT` extension,\n* If `WebGL2` is not available, and if `WebGL1` is not available or neither `OES_TEXTURE_FLOAT` or `OES_HALF_TEXTURE_FLOAT` are implemented, the user is not compatible.\n\nIn all cases, you need to have WebRTC implemented in the web browser, otherwise this library will not be able to get the webcam video feed. The compatibility tables are on, [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/): [WebGL1](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl), [WebGL2](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl2), [WebRTC](https://caniuse.com/#feat=stream).\n\nIf a compatibility error is triggered, please post an issue on this repository. If this is a camera access error, please first retry after closing all applications which could use your device (Skype, Messenger, other browser tabs and windows, ...). Please include:\n* a screenshot of [webglreport.com - WebGL1](http://webglreport.com/?v=1) (about your `WebGL1` implementation),\n* a screenshot of [webglreport.com - WebGL2](http://webglreport.com/?v=2) (about your `WebGL2` implementation),\n* the log from the web console,\n* the steps to reproduce the bug, and screenshots.\n\nThis library works quite everywhere, and it works very well with a high end device like an Iphone X. But if your device is too cheap or too old, it will perform too few evaluations per second and the application will be slow.\n\n\n### Future improvements\nWe are currently working hard on this project. New neural networks are training and we are confident about improving this library. Here are our ways to improve:\n\n* Better emotion detection with a better neural network (improving the structure, the face generator, ...),\n* Better tracking stabilization,\n* Add a calibration estimation to take into account the variations of the coefficients between different faces.\n\nYou can subscribe to the [Jeeliz Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XmXH1T3d1XFyOhrRiiUeA) or to the [@StartupJeeliz Twitter account](https://twitter.com/StartupJeeliz) to be kept informed of our cutting edge developments.\n\n\n## Documentation\n ### Documentation\n\n * `JEEFACETRANSFERAPI`: All the helpers rely on this API to get the facial morph coefficients. With this documentation you can interface this library with your own 3D or 2D engine. [Click here to read the PDF of the specs](/doc/jeefacetransferAPI.pdf),\n * [README.md about using the meshConverter](/meshConverter): Used in the THREE.JS Raccoon demo\n\n\n ### Articles and tutorials\n We list articles and tutorials about using this library:\n\n * [Create your own animated emoticon for the web](https://jeeliz.com/blog/create-animojis-for-the-web/)\n * [Integrate the animated emoticon on your website](https://jeeliz.com/blog/add-a-weboji-on-website/)\n\n\n\n## Need more?\n@Jeeliz we have fully developed this library so we can still improve it or fit it to your needs. In particular:\n\n* adapt it to your own 3D/2D engine,\n* train a new neural network model adapted for a specific case (take account of new expressions for example),\n* use your specific mesh format,\n* integrate it better to your workflow,\n* manage the video/audio capture and encoding of the weboji.\n\nIf you are interested, please [contact-us here](https://jeeliz.com/contact-us/).\n\n\n\n## License\n[Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

Of course we do not expect a large link to Jeeliz over your face filter, but if you can put the link in the credits/about/help/footer section it would be great.\n\n\n## See also\nJeeliz main face detection and tracking library is called [Jeeliz FaceFilter API](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizFaceFilter). It handles multi-face detection, and for each tracked face it provides the rotation angles and the mouth opening factor. It is perfect to build your own Snapchat/MSQRD like face filters running in the browser. It comes with dozen of integration demo, including a face swap.\n\nIf you want to detect if the user is looking at the screen or not, [Jeeliz Glance Tracker](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizGlanceTracker) is what you are looking for. It can be useful to play a video only if the user is watching it (and to pause it otherwise). This library needs fewer resources and the neural network file is much lighter.\n\nIf are interested by glasses virtual try-on (sunglasses, spectacles, ski masks), you can take a look at [Jeeliz VTO widget](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizGlassesVTOWidget). It includes a high quality and lightweight 3D engine which implements the following features: deferred shading, PBR, raytraced shadows, normal mapping, ... It also reconstructs the lighting environment around the user (ambient and directional lighting). The glasses are hosted in a database on our servers. If you want to add some models, please contact-us.\n\n\n## References\n* [Jeeliz official website](https://jeeliz.com)\n* [Three.JS official website with documentation, demos, examples...](https://threejs.org/)\n* [Webgl Academy: tutorials about WebGL and THREE.JS](http://www.webglacademy.com)\n\n'
