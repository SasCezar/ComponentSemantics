b'# Custom Console Logging with Emoji\n\nDebugging JavaScript can be painful and often means spending hours looking at boring console logs. Inspired by [console.frog](http://tholman.com/console-dot-frog/) by Tim Holman, I made my own console logger &mdash; but with customizable commands and emojis. Logging to the console is finally fun again, thanks to `console.beer` :beer: and `console.unicorn` \xf0\x9f\xa6\x84.\n\n[Go here](https://ines.io/blog/custom-console-logging-emoji) to read the blog post and see it in action.\n\n![Preview](https://ines.io/blog/img/emoji-console_preview.jpg)\n\n# Example\n\nSimply include `console.emoji.js` in your project or copy/past/adapt the code.\n\n```javascript\n// Logging to the console\nconsole.unicorn("So magical!");\n\n// Output\n\xf0\x9f\xa6\x84  So magical!\n```\n\n# License\n\nPublished under the MIT license.\nInspired by and adapted from [console.frog](https://github.com/tholman/console-dot-frog) by [Tim Holman](http://tholman.com).\n'
