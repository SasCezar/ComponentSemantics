It has a settings activity that allows you to switch between iOS and Android style emojis.\n\n### Download\n\nThe current version of this repo isn\'t (and won\'t) be on the Play Store. I have 3 legacy versions out on the Play Store that support features of our older apps and shouldn\'t be updated/removed for that reason. They can be found here:\n\n[Unlocker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.emoji_keyboard)\n\n[Android Emoji Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.emoji_keyboard_trial)\n\n[iOS Emoji Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.emoji_keyboard_trial_ios)\n\nThe current version of that app, which houses the iOS and Android emojis, in a single keyboard, can be downloaded from the attached [APK](emoji-keyboard.apk), if you would rather not just clone the repo and build it.\n\n---\n\n## License\n\n    Copyright 2014 Luke Klinker\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n'
