This will perform better and won\'t require modifications to the system.\nPrefer pip version if possible, because the one in debian archives is ancient.\n\n`pip3 install python-xlib`\n\n**IF YOU\'RE ON WAYLAND**\nYou\'ll need to:\n- Create `uinput` group `sudo addgroup uinput`\n- Add yourself to this group `sudo adduser $(whoami) uinput`\n- Create udev rule. In the terminal type this:\n\t- `sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/uinput.rules`\n\t- `KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="uinput", MODE="0660"`\n\t- To save press `Ctrl+o` `Enter` `Ctrl+x`\n\nThis will allow your user to create virtual devices for pasting emoji, without these steps Type mode WILL NOT WORK.\n\n\n### App\n\nThere are several ways to install the app, ~~you can install from deb you can\nfind on\n[releases page](https://github.com/OzymandiasTheGreat/emoji-keyboard/releases)~~.\n\nYou can install with pip\n\n`sudo pip3 install\nhttps://github.com/OzymandiasTheGreat/emoji-keyboard/archive/master.zip`\n\nThere\'s also ppa, courtesy of [atareao](https://github.com/atareao)\nNote that this ppa is NOT maintained by me, so I can\'t guarantee latest versions.\n\n`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/atareao`\n\n`sudo apt update`\n\n`sudo apt install emoji-keyboard`\n\n## Usage\n\n### Keyboard\n\nSelecting `Show Keyboard` from the app indicator menu or, if your desktop\nenvironment supports it, middle-clicking app indicator will toggle the visibility\nof the keyboard. When the picker is visible simply clicking on emoji will type it\ninto focused application.\n\n### Search\n\nYou can search by official unicode name or by :shortname:.\nPressing `enter` will select and type the first result.\n\n### Hotkeys\n\n`emoji-keyboard` can be controlled from the command line. Use your desktop\'s\nnative hotkey utility to assign hotkeys to\n\n`emoji-keyboard -k` to toggle visibility of the keyboard,\n\n`emoji-keyboard -s` to toggle visibility of the search window.\n\nRun `emoji-keyboard -h` in the terminal to get full list of commands.\n'
