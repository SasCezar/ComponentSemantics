In addition, you are welcome to request to have your logo listed on the homepage. Thank you for your support.\n\n### Technical overview\n\n#### Function Watchdog\n\n* You can make any Docker image into a serverless function by adding the *Function Watchdog* (a tiny Golang HTTP server)\n* The *Function Watchdog* is the entrypoint allowing HTTP requests to be forwarded to the target process via STDIN or HTTP. The response is sent back to the caller by writing to STDOUT or HTTP from your application.\n\n#### API Gateway / UI Portal\n\n* The API Gateway provides an external route into your functions and collects Cloud Native metrics through Prometheus.\n* Your API Gateway will scale functions according to demand by altering the service replica count in the Docker Swarm or Kubernetes API.\n* A UI is baked in allowing you to invoke functions in your browser and create new ones as needed.\n\n> The API Gateway is a RESTful micro-service and you can view the [Swagger docs here](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/tree/master/api-docs).\n\n#### CLI\n\nUsing the [faas-cli](http://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli) and `faas-cli up` you can create, build, distribute, and deploy your code in a very short period of time.\n\nAny container or process in a Docker container can be a serverless workload in OpenFaaS, as long as it [conforms to The Workload Contract](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/workloads/).\n\nCreate new functions from templates for Node.js, Python, [Go](https://blog.alexellis.io/serverless-golang-with-openfaas/) and many more. If you can\'t find a suitable template you can also use a Dockerfile or create your own.\n\nThe CLI is effectively a RESTful client for the API Gateway. When you have OpenFaaS configured you can [get started with the CLI here](https://blog.alexellis.io/quickstart-openfaas-cli/)\n\n#### Examples\n\nYou can generate new functions using the `faas-cli` and built-in templates or use any binary for Windows or Linux in a Docker container.\n\nOfficial templates exist for many popular languages and are easily extensible with Dockerfiles.\n\n* Node.js (`node10-express`) example:\n\n    ```js\n    "use strict"\n\n    module.exports = (event, context) => {\n\n    context\n        .headers({"Content-Type": "text/html"})\n        .status(200)\n        .succeed(`\n        <h1>\n            \xf0\x9f\x91\x8b Hello World \xf0\x9f\x8c\x8d\n        </h1>`)\n    }\n    ```\n    *handler.js*\n\n* Python 3 example:\n\n    ```python\n    import requests\n\n    def handle(req):\n        r =  requests.get(req, timeout = 1)\n        return "{} => {:d}".format(req, r.status_code)\n    ```\n    *handler.py*\n\n* Golang example (`golang-http`)\n\n    ```golang\n    package function\n\n    import (\n        "log"\n\n        "github.com/openfaas-incubator/go-function-sdk"\n    )\n\n    func Handle(req handler.Request) (handler.Response, error) {\n        var err error\n\n        return handler.Response{\n            Body: []byte("Try us out today!"),\n            Header: map[string][]string{\n                "X-Served-By": []string{"openfaas.com"},\n            },\n        }, err\n    }\n    ```\n\nThe easiest way to get started with functions is to [take the workshop](https://github.com/openfaas/workshop) or one of the tutorials in the documentation.\n\n## Get started with OpenFaaS\n\n### Join the Community\n\n* [Join Slack](https://docs.openfaas.com/community)\n* [Become a GitHub sponsor](https://insiders.openfaas.io/)\n\n### Official blog and documentation\n\n* Read the documentation: [docs.openfaas.com](https://docs.openfaas.com/)\n* Send a PR or raise an issue for the docs [openfaas/docs](https://github.com/openfaas/docs)\n* Read latest news and tutorials on the [Official Blog](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/)\n\n### Workshop (hands-on learning)\n\nYou can learn how to build functions and microservices with OpenFaaS using the [OpenFaaS workshop](http://github.com/openfaas/workshop).
