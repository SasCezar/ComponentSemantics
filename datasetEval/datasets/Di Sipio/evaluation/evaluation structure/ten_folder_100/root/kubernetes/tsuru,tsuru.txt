As an application developer, you can:\n- Write apps in the programming language of your choice\n- Back apps with add-on resources such as SQL and NoSQL databases, including memcached, Redis, and many others\n- Manage apps using the `tsuru` command-line tool\n- Deploy apps using the Git version control system\n\nLinks:\n\n- Full Documentation: https://docs.tsuru.io\n- How to Contribute: https://docs.tsuru.io/stable/contributing/\n- Repository & Issue Tracker: https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru\n- Talk to us on Gitter: https://gitter.im/tsuru/tsuru\n\n## Quick Start\n\nWith the purpose of testing tsuru and/or for development, you can use the [installer](https://docs.tsuru.io/stable/installing/using-tsuru-installer.html) to have tsuru up and running. The installer is an experimental feature.\n\n### From Binary\n\n#### Getting tsuru-client\n\nDownload the latest release for your platform at: https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client/releases/\n\nExample for release `1.1.1` and `OS X`:\n\n```\n$ curl -sSL https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client/releases/download/1.1.1/tsuru-1.1.1-darwin_amd64.tar.gz | tar xz\n```\n\n#### Call tsuru installer\n\n```\n$ tsuru install create\n```\n\n### From Source\n\n#### Getting tsuru-client\n\nYou need to have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) properly installed on your machine.\n\n```\n$ git clone github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client $GOPATH/src/github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client\n$ make install\n```\n\n#### Create an installer config\n\nCreate the tsuru installer config files with:\n\n```\n$ tsuru install config init\n```\n\nReplace the tsuru API image tag with the latest tag in `install-compose.yml`:\n\n```\n$ sed -i'' -e 's/api:v1/api:latest/g' install-compose.yml\n```\n\n#### Call tsuru installer\n\n```\n$ $GOPATH/bin/tsuru install create -c install-config.yml -e install-compose.yml\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nIf everything's gone well you have the tsuru running in a VirtualBox VM.\nCall `app-list` to see tsuru working, this command needs to return one app called tsuru-dashboard.\n\n```\n$ tsuru app-list\n```\n"
