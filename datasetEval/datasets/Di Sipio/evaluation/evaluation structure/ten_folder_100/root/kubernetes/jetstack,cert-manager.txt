You can also search the documentation using the search box on the\ntop left of the page.\n\nIf you believe you have encountered a bug, and cannot find an existing issue similar to your\nown, you may [open a new issue](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/issues).\nPlease be sure to include as much information as possible about your environment.\n\n## Community\n\nThere is a Google Group used for project wide announcements and development coordination.\nAnybody can join the group by visiting [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cert-manager-dev)\nand clicking "Join Group". A Google account is required to join the group.\n\nOnce you have become a member, you should receive an invite to the weekly development\nmeeting, hosted on **Wednesdays at 4pm UTC** on Zoom.us.\n\nAnyone is welcome to join these calls, even if just to ask questions.\n\nMeeting notes are recorded in [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tc5t6ylY9dhXAan1OjOoldeaoys1Yh4Ir710ATfBa5U).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome pull requests with open arms! There\'s a lot of work to do here, and\nwe\'re especially concerned with ensuring the longevity and reliability of the\nproject.\n\nPlease take a look at our [issue tracker](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/issues)\nif you are unsure where to start with getting involved!\n\nWe also use the #cert-manager channel on kubernetes.slack.com for chat relating to\nthe project.\n\nDeveloper documentation is available in the [official documentation](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/devel/index.html).\n\n## Changelog\n\nThe [list of releases](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases)\nis the best place to look for information on changes between releases.\n\n<sub><sup>Logo design by [Zoe Paterson](https://zoepatersonmedia.com)</sup></sub>\n'
