If you\'re running v2, please ensure you are using a [v2 configuration](https://docs.traefik.io/).\n\n## Overview\n\nImagine that you have deployed a bunch of microservices with the help of an orchestrator (like Swarm or Kubernetes) or a service registry (like etcd or consul).\nNow you want users to access these microservices, and you need a reverse proxy.\n\nTraditional reverse-proxies require that you configure _each_ route that will connect paths and subdomains to _each_ microservice. \nIn an environment where you add, remove, kill, upgrade, or scale your services _many_ times a day, the task of keeping the routes up to date becomes tedious. \n\n**This is when Traefik can help you!**\n\nTraefik listens to your service registry/orchestrator API and instantly generates the routes so your microservices are connected to the outside world -- without further intervention from your part. \n\n**Run Traefik and let it do the work for you!** \n_(But if you\'d rather configure some of your routes manually, Traefik supports that too!)_\n\n![Architecture](docs/content/assets/img/traefik-architecture.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- Continuously updates its configuration (No restarts!)\n- Supports multiple load balancing algorithms\n- Provides HTTPS to your microservices by leveraging [Let\'s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)  (wildcard certificates support)\n- Circuit breakers, retry\n- See the magic through its clean web UI\n- Websocket, HTTP/2, GRPC ready\n- Provides metrics (Rest, Prometheus, Datadog, Statsd, InfluxDB)\n- Keeps access logs (JSON, CLF)\n- Fast\n- Exposes a Rest API\n- Packaged as a single binary file (made with :heart: with go) and available as a [tiny](https://microbadger.com/images/traefik) [official](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/traefik/) docker image\n\n\n## Supported Backends\n\n- [Docker](https://docs.traefik.io/providers/docker/) / [Swarm mode](https://docs.traefik.io/providers/docker/)\n-
