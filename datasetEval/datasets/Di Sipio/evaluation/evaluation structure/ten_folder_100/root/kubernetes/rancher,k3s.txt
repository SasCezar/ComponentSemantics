b"k3s - 5 less than k8s\n===============================================\n\nLightweight Kubernetes.  Easy to install, half the memory, all in a binary less than 40mb.\n\nGreat for:\n\n* Edge\n* IoT\n* CI\n* ARM\n* Situations where a PhD in k8s clusterology is infeasible\n\nWhat is this?\n---\n\nk3s is intended to be a fully compliant Kubernetes distribution with the following changes:\n\n1. Legacy, alpha, non-default features are removed. Hopefully, you shouldn't notice the\n   stuff that has been removed.\n2. Removed most in-tree plugins (cloud providers and storage plugins) which can be replaced\n   with out of tree addons.\n3. Add sqlite3 as the default storage mechanism. etcd3 is still available, but not the default.\n4. Wrapped in simple launcher that handles a lot of the complexity of TLS and options.\n5. Minimal to no OS dependencies (just a sane kernel and cgroup mounts needed). k3s packages required\n   dependencies\n    * containerd\n    * Flannel\n    * CoreDNS\n    * CNI\n    * Host utilities (iptables, socat, etc)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nPlease see [the official docs site](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/) for complete documentation on k3s.\n\nQuick-Start - Install Script\n--------------\nThe k3s `install.sh` script provides a convenient way for installing to systemd or openrc,\nto install k3s as a service just run:\n```bash\ncurl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -\n```\n\nA kubeconfig file is written to `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` and the service is automatically started or restarted.\nThe install script will install k3s and additional utilities, such as `kubectl`, `crictl`, `k3s-killall.sh`, and `k3s-uninstall.sh`, for example:\n\n```bash\nsudo kubectl get nodes\n```\n\n`K3S_TOKEN` is created at `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token` on your server.\nTo install on worker nodes we should pass `K3S_URL` along with\n`K3S_TOKEN` or `K3S_CLUSTER_SECRET` environment variables, for example:\n```bash\ncurl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://myserver:6443 K3S_TOKEN=XXX sh -\n```\n\nManual Download\n---------------\n1. Download `k3s` from latest [release](https://github.com/rancher/k3s/releases/latest), x86_64, armhf, and arm64 are supported.\n2. Run server.\n\n```bash\nsudo k3s server &\n# Kubeconfig is written to /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml\nsudo k3s kubectl get nodes\n\n# On a different node run the below. NODE_TOKEN comes from \n# /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token on your server\nsudo k3s agent --server https://myserver:6443 --token ${NODE_TOKEN}\n```\n"
