You can iterate on your application source code\nlocally then deploy to local or remote Kubernetes clusters. Skaffold handles\nthe workflow for building, pushing and deploying your application. It also\nprovides building blocks and describe customizations for a CI/CD pipeline.\n\n---------------------\n\n## Community\n\n**We\'d love to hear from you!**\n\n* [skaffold-users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/skaffold-users)\n* [#skaffold on Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/CABQMSZA6/)\n* [Give us Feedback](https://skaffold.dev/docs/resources/feedback/)\n\n**Office Hours** \n\nSkaffold office hours are for The Skaffold Community. We want to provide an open forum for the Community to share\n   * How can we make Skaffold better as a community: design proposals, issues or concerns, questions, ideas \n   * How can we make contributing to Skaffold better\n   * How you are using Skaffold - demo of features, integrations are welcome to be shared with the community so everyone can learn from it!\n\nPlease feel free to add suggestions to the [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mnCC_fAI3pmg3Vb2nMJyPk8Qtjjuapw_BTyqI_dX7sk/edit) and attend.\n\nJoin the [skaffold-users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/skaffold-users) to get the calendar invite directly on your calendar.\nYou can access the hangouts invite directly from this calendar invite.\n\n**Survey** \n\nYour feedback is very valuable to us! We have an anonymous user feedback survey - please help us by spending a quick 5 minutes to tell us how satisfied you are with Skaffold, and what improvements we should make!\n\nSurvey Link - https://forms.gle/BMTbGQXLWSdn7vEs6\n\n\n## Features\n\n* Fast local Kubernetes Development\n  * **optimized source-to-k8s** - Skaffold detects changes in your source code and handles the pipeline to\n  **build**, **push**, and **deploy** your application automatically with **policy based image tagging** and **highly optimized, fast local workflows**\n  * **continuous feedback** - Skaffold automatically manages logging and port-forwarding\n* Skaffold projects work everywhere\n  * **share with other developers** - Skaffold is the easiest way to **share your project** with the world: `git clone` and `skaffold run`\n  * **context aware** - use Skaffold profiles, user level config, environment variables and flags to describe differences in environments\n  * **CI/CD building blocks** - use `skaffold run` end-to-end or just part of skaffold stages from build to deployment in your CI/CD system\n* skaffold.yaml - a single pluggable, declarative configuration for your project\n  * **skaffold init** - Skaffold discovers your files and generates its own config file\n  * **multi-component apps** - Skaffold supports applications consisting of multiple components\n  * **bring your own tools** - Skaffold has a pluggable architecture to allow for different implementations of the stages\n* Lightweight\n  * **client-side only** - Skaffold does not require maintaining a cluster-side component, so there is no overhead or maintenance burden to\n  your cluster.\n  * **minimal pipeline** - Skaffold provides an opinionated, minimal pipeline to keep things simple\n\n## Install\n\nInstallation methods can be found in the [Getting Started Guide](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/).\n\nSee [Github Releases](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/releases) for more information.\n\n:mega: **Please fill out our [quick 5-question survey](https://forms.gle/BMTbGQXLWSdn7vEs6)** so that we can learn how satisfied you are with Skaffold, and what improvements we should make.

Every time you run `skaffold dev`, the system\n\n1. Collects and watches your source code for changes\n1. Syncs files directly to pods if user marks them as syncable\n1. Builds artifacts from the source code\n1. Tests the built artifacts using container-structure-tests\n1. Tags the artifacts\n1. Pushes the artifacts\n1. Deploys the artifacts\n1. Monitors the deployed artifacts\n1. Cleans up deployed artifacts on exit (Ctrl+C)\n\nWhat\'s more, the pluggable architecture is central to Skaffold\'s design, allowing you to use\nthe tool you prefer in each stage. Also, Skaffold\'s `profiles` feature grants\nyou the freedom to switch tools as you see fit depending on the context.\n\nFor example, if you are coding on a local machine, you can configure Skaffold to build artifacts\nwith local Docker daemon and deploy them to minikube\nusing `kubectl`, the Kubernetes command-line interface and when you finalize your\ndesign, you can switch to the production profile and start building with\nGoogle Cloud Build and deploy with Helm.\n\nSkaffold supports the following tools:\n\n* Build\n  * Dockerfile locally\n  * Dockerfile in-cluster (kaniko)\n  * Dockerfile on cloud (Google Cloud Build)\n  * Bazel locally\n  * Jib Maven/Gradle locally\n* Test\n  * with container-structure-test\n* Tag\n  * tag by git commit\n  * tag by current date&time\n  * tag by environment variables based template\n* Push\n  * don\'t push - keep the image on the local daemon\n  * push to registry\n* Deploy\n  * Kubernetes Command-Line Interface (`kubectl`)\n  * Helm\n  * kustomize\n\n![architecture](docs/static/images/architecture.png)\n\nBesides the above steps, skaffold also automatically manages the following utilities for you:\n\n* forwards container ports to your local machine using `kubectl port-forward`\n* aggregates all the logs from the deployed pods\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for latest release: <https://skaffold.dev>\n\nDocumentation for latest build: <https://skaffold-latest.firebaseapp.com>\n\n## More examples\n\nCheck out our [examples page](./examples)\n\n\n## Support \n\nSkaffold is generally available and considered production ready. \nDetailed feature maturity information and how we deprecate features are described in our [Deprecation Policy](https://skaffold.dev/docs/references/deprecation).\n\nSupport channels: \n\n* Github Issues and PRs on this repo is our primary channel: the Skaffold team triages Github Issues and PRs daily, PRs are welcome (please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details).\n* [skaffold-users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/skaffold-users)\n* [#skaffold on Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/CABQMSZA6/): you can find us there on a best effort basis\n* Skaffold Office hours at 9AM PST, every other Wednesday: join the [skaffold-users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/skaffold-users) to get the calendar invite directly on your calendar.  \n\n'
