With Vitess, you can even split and merge shards as your needs\ngrow, with an atomic cutover step that takes only a few seconds.\n\nVitess has been a core component of YouTube's database infrastructure\nsince 2011, and has grown to encompass tens of thousands of MySQL nodes.\n\nFor more about Vitess, please visit [vitess.io](https://vitess.io).\n\nVitess has a growing community.
