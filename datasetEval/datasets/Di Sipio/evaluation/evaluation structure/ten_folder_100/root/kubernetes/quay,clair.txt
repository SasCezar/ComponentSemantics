In regular intervals, Clair ingests vulnerability metadata from a configured set of sources and stores it in the database.\n2. Clients use the Clair API to index their container images; this creates a list of _features_ present in the image and stores them in the database.\n3. Clients use the Clair API to query the database for vulnerabilities of a particular image; correlating vulnerabilities and features is done for each request, avoiding the need to rescan images.\n4. When updates to vulnerability metadata occur, a notification can be sent to alert systems that a change has occurred.\n\nOur goal is to enable a more transparent view of the security of container-based infrastructure.\nThus, the project was named `Clair` after the French term which translates to *clear*, *bright*, *transparent*.\n\n[appc]: https://github.com/appc/spec\n[docker]: https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/image/spec/v1.2.md\n[releases]: https://github.com/coreos/clair/releases\n[static analysis]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis\n\n## Getting Started\n\n* Learn [the terminology] and about the [drivers and data sources] that power Clair\n* Watch [presentations] on the high-level goals and design of Clair\n* Follow instructions to get Clair [up and running]\n* Explore [the API] on SwaggerHub\n* Discover third party [integrations] that help integrate Clair with your infrastructure\n* Read the rest of the documentation on the [CoreOS website] or in the [Documentation directory]\n* Get up and running with [Local Development]\n\n[the terminology]: /Documentation/terminology.md\n[drivers and data sources]: /Documentation/drivers-and-data-sources.md\n[presentations]: /Documentation/presentations.md\n[up and running]: /Documentation/running-clair.md\n[the API]: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/coreos/clair/3.0\n[integrations]: /Documentation/integrations.md\n[CoreOS website]: https://coreos.com/clair/docs/latest/\n[Documentation directory]: /Documentation\n[Local Development]: /Documentation/local-development.md\n\n## Community\n\n- Mailing List: [clair-dev@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clair-dev)\n- IRC: #[clair](irc://irc.freenode.org:6667/#clair) on freenode.org\n- Bugs: [issues](https://github.com/coreos/clair/issues)\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on submitting patches and the contribution workflow.\n\n## License\n\nClair is under the Apache 2.0 license.
