b"# flannel\n\n![flannel Logo](logos/flannel-horizontal-color.png)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coreos/flannel.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/coreos/flannel)\n\nFlannel is a simple and easy way to configure a layer 3 network fabric designed for Kubernetes.\n\n## How it works\n\nFlannel runs a small, single binary agent called `flanneld` on each host, and is responsible for allocating a subnet lease to each host out of a larger, preconfigured address space.\nFlannel uses either the Kubernetes API or [etcd][etcd] directly to store the network configuration, the allocated subnets, and any auxiliary data (such as the host's public IP).\nPackets are forwarded using one of several [backend mechanisms][backends] including VXLAN and various cloud integrations.\n\n### Networking details\n\nPlatforms like Kubernetes assume that each container (pod) has a unique, routable IP inside the cluster.\nThe advantage of this model is that it removes the port mapping complexities that come from sharing a single host IP.\n\nFlannel is responsible for providing a layer 3 IPv4 network between multiple nodes in a cluster. Flannel does not control how containers are networked to the host, only how the traffic is transported between hosts. However, flannel does provide a CNI plugin for Kubernetes and a guidance on integrating with Docker.\n\nFlannel is focused on networking. For network policy, other projects such as [Calico][calico] can be used.\n\n## Getting started on Kubernetes\n\nThe easiest way to deploy flannel with Kubernetes is to use one of several deployment tools and distributions that network clusters with flannel by default. For example, CoreOS's [Tectonic][tectonic] sets up flannel in the Kubernetes clusters it creates using the open source [Tectonic Installer][tectonic-installer] to drive the setup process.\n\nThough not required, it's recommended that flannel uses the Kubernetes API as its backing store which avoids the need to deploy a discrete `etcd` cluster for `flannel`. This `flannel` mode is known as the *kube subnet manager*.\n\n### Deploying flannel manually\n\nFlannel can be added to any existing Kubernetes cluster though it's simplest to add `flannel` before any pods using the pod network have been started.\n\nFor Kubernetes v1.7+\n`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml`\n\nSee [Kubernetes](Documentation/kubernetes.md) for more details.\n\n## Getting started on Docker\n\nflannel is also widely used outside of kubernetes. When deployed outside of kubernetes, etcd is always used as the datastore.
