It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. Rook uses the facilities provided by the underlying cloud-native container management, scheduling and orchestration platform to perform its duties.\n\nRook integrates deeply into cloud native environments leveraging extension points and providing a seamless experience for scheduling, lifecycle management, resource management, security, monitoring, and user experience.\n\nFor more details about the storage solutions currently supported by Rook, please refer to the [project status section](#project-status) below.\nWe plan to continue adding support for other storage systems and environments based on community demand and engagement in future releases. See our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for more details.\n\nRook is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as an incubating level project. If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who\'s involved and how Rook plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/01/29/cncf-host-rook-project-cloud-native-storage-capabilities).\n\n## Getting Started and Documentation\n\nFor installation, deployment, and administration, see our [Documentation](https://rook.github.io/docs/rook/master).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions.

Support for upgrading or migrating between versions will be provided, either through automation or manual steps.\n- **Stable:** Features will appear in released software for many subsequent versions and support for upgrading between versions will be provided with software automation in the vast majority of scenarios.\n\nName           | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | API Group                    | Status\n---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------\nRook Framework | The framework for common storage specs and logic used to support other storage providers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | rook.io/v1alpha2             | Alpha\nCeph           | [Ceph](https://ceph.com/) is a distributed storage system that provides file, block and object storage and is deployed in large scale production clusters.                                                                                                                                                             | ceph.rook.io/v1              | Stable\nCockroachDB    | [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/product/cockroachdb/) is a cloud-native SQL database for building global, scalable cloud services that survive disasters.                                                                                                                                                  | cockroachdb.rook.io/v1alpha1 | Alpha\nCassandra      | [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) is a highly available NoSQL database featuring lightning fast performance, tunable consistency and massive scalability.
