b'# Fission: Serverless Functions for Kubernetes\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fission/fission.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fission/fission)\n[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/fission/fission)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/fission/fission)\n[![Fission Slack](http://slack.fission.io/badge.svg)](http://slack.fission.io)\n\n[fission.io](http://fission.io) [@fissionio](http://twitter.com/fissionio)\n\nFission is a fast serverless framework for Kubernetes with a focus on\ndeveloper productivity and high performance.\n\nFission operates on _just the code_: Docker and Kubernetes are\nabstracted away under normal operation, though you can use both to\nextend Fission if you want to.\n\nFission is extensible to any language; the core is written in Go, and\nlanguage-specific parts are isolated in something called\n_environments_ (more below).  Fission currently supports NodeJS, Python, Ruby, Go, \nPHP, Bash, and any Linux executable, with more languages coming soon.\n\n# Performance: 100msec cold start\n\nFission maintains a pool of "warm" containers that each contain a\nsmall dynamic loader.  When a function is first called,\ni.e. "cold-started", a running container is chosen and the function is\nloaded.  This pool is what makes Fission fast: cold-start latencies\nare typically about 100msec.\n\n# Kubernetes is the right place for Serverless\n\nWe\'re built on Kubernetes because we think any non-trivial app will\nuse a combination of serverless functions and more conventional\nmicroservices, and Kubernetes is a great framework to bring these\ntogether seamlessly.\n\nBuilding on Kubernetes also means that anything you do for operations\non your Kubernetes cluster &mdash; such as monitoring or log\naggregation &mdash; also helps with ops on your Fission deployment.\n\n# Getting started and documentation\n\n## Fission Concepts\n\nVisit [concepts](https://docs.fission.io/docs/concepts/) for more details.\n\n## Documentations\n\nYou can learn more about Fission and get started from [Fission Docs](https://docs.fission.io/docs).\n* See the [installation guide](https://docs.fission.io/docs/installation/) for installing and running Fission.\n* See the [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.fission.io/docs/trouble-shooting/) for debugging your functions and Fission installation.\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n  # Add the stock NodeJS env to your Fission deployment\n  $ fission env create --name nodejs --image fission/node-env\n\n  # A javascript one-liner that prints "hello world"\n  $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fission/fission/master/examples/nodejs/hello.js > hello.js\n\n  # Upload your function code to fission\n  $ fission function create --name hello --env nodejs --code hello.js\n\n  # Map GET /hello to your new function\n  $ fission route create --method GET --url /hello --function hello\n\n  # Run the function.  This takes about 100msec the first time.\n  $ fission function test --name hello\n  Hello, world!\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\n## Building Fission\nSee the [compilation guide](https://docs.fission.io/docs/contributing/).\n\n## Contact\nReach us on [slack](http://slack.fission.io) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/fissionio).\n\nFission is a project by [many contributors](https://github.com/fission/fission/graphs/contributors).\n\n## Community meeting \n\nA regular community meeting takes place every other Thursday at 08:30 AM PT (Pacific Time). [Convert to your local timezone](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=08:30&tz=PT%20%28Pacific%20Time%29).\n\n# Official Releases\n\nOfficial releases of Fission can be found on [the releases page](https://github.com/fission/fission/releases). \nPlease note that it is strongly recommended that you use official releases of Fission, as unreleased versions from \nthe master branch are subject to changes and incompatibilities that will not be supported in the official releases. \nBuilds from the master branch can have functionality changed and even removed at any time without compatibility support \nand without prior notice.\n\n# Licensing\n\nFission is under the Apache 2.0 license.\n'
