b'# Flux\n\n> **Announcement** [Flux has joined CNCF as a sandbox project](https://www.weave.works/blog/flux-joins-the-cncf-sandbox)\n\nWe believe in GitOps:\n\n- **You declaratively describe the entire desired state of your\n  system in git.** This includes the apps, config, dashboards,\n  monitoring and everything else.\n- **What can be described can be automated.** Use YAMLs to enforce\n  conformance of the system. You don\'t need to run `kubectl`, all changes go\n  through git. Use diff tools to detect divergence between observed and\n  desired state and get notifications.\n- **You push code not containers.** Everything is controlled through\n  pull requests. There is no learning curve for new devs, they just use\n  your standard git PR process. The history in git allows you to recover\n  from any snapshot as you have a sequence of transactions. It is much\n  more transparent to make operational changes by pull request, e.g.\n  fix a production issue via a pull request instead of making changes to\n  the running system.\n\nFlux is a tool that automatically ensures that the state of a cluster\nmatches the config in git. It uses an operator in the cluster to trigger\ndeployments inside Kubernetes, which means you don\'t need a separate CD tool.\nIt monitors all relevant image repositories, detects new images, triggers\ndeployments and updates the desired running configuration based on that\n(and a configurable policy).\n\nThe benefits are: you don\'t need to grant your CI access to the cluster, every\nchange is atomic and transactional, git has your audit log. Each transaction\neither fails or succeeds cleanly. You\'re entirely code centric and don\'t need\nnew infrastructure.\n\n![Deployment Pipeline](docs/_files/flux-cd-diagram.png)\n\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/fluxcd/flux.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/fluxcd/flux)\n[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fluxcd/flux?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/fluxcd/flux)\n[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/latest-documentation-informational)](https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/latest/)\n\n## What Flux does\n\nFlux is most useful when used as a deployment tool at the end of a\nContinuous Delivery pipeline. Flux will make sure that your new\ncontainer images and config changes are propagated to the cluster.\n\n### Who is using Flux in production\n\n- [ABA English](https://www.abaenglish.com)\n- [APPUiO](https://appuio.ch)\n- [Apester](https://apester.com)\n- [ArangoDB Oasis](https://arangodb.com/managed-service)\n- [Avisi](https://avisi.nl)\n- [Babylon Health](https://www.babylonhealth.com/)\n- [bimspot](https://bimspot.io)\n- [CLVR Cloud Ltd](https://clvr.cloud)\n- [College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu)\n- [Control Plane](https://control-plane.io)\n- [Crowd Riff](https://crowdriff.com)\n- [Cybrary](https://cybrary.it)\n- [FireHydrant](https://firehydrant.io)\n- [Gini](https://gini.net)\n- [HMCTS](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service)\n- [IBM Cloudant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloudant)\n- [Improwised Technologies](https://www.improwised.com/)\n- [iQmetrix](https://www.iqmetrix.com)\n- [karriere tutor GmbH](https://www.karrieretutor.de)\n- [Limejump](https://limejump.com)\n- [loveholidays](https://www.loveholidays.com/)\n- [LUNAR](https://www.lunarway.com/)\n- [Mettle](https://mettle.co.uk)\n- [Omise](https://www.omise.co)\n- [Payout](https://payout.one)\n- [Qordoba](https://qordoba.com)\n- [Rakuten](https://rakuten.com)\n- [Replicated](https://replicated.com)\n- [Rungway](https://rungway.com)\n- [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/)\n- [Troii](https://troii.com/)\n- [Under Armour](https://www.underarmour.com)\n- [VSHN](https://vshn.ch)\n- [Walmart Chile](https://www.walmartchile.cl)\n- [Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works)\n- [Working Group Two](https://wgtwo.com)\n- [Yusofleet](https://yusofleet.com)\n- [Yad2](https://yad2.co.il)\n\nIf you too are using Flux in production; please submit a PR to add your organization to the list!\n\n### History\n\nIn the first years of its existence, the development of Flux was very\nclosely coupled to that of [Weave\nCloud](https://www.weave.works/product/cloud/). Over the years the community\naround Flux grew, the numbers of [integrations](#integrations) grew and\nthe team started the process of generalising the code, so that more projects\ncould easily integrate.\n\n## Get started with Flux\n\nWith the following tutorials:\n\n- [Get started with Flux](https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/latest/tutorials/get-started.html)\n- [Get started with Flux using Helm](https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/latest/tutorials/get-started-helm.html)\n\nor just [browse through the documentation](https://docs.fluxcd.io).\n\nDo you want to release your Helm charts in a declarative way?\nTake a look at the [`fluxcd/helm-operator`](https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-operator).\n\n### Integrations\n\nAs Flux is Open Source, integrations are very straight-forward.
