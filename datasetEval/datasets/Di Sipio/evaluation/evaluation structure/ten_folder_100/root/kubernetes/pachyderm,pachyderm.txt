If you need to chain\ntogether data scraping, ingestion, cleaning, munging, wrangling, processing,\nmodeling, and analysis in a sane way, then Pachyderm is for you. If you have an\nexisting set of scripts which do this in an ad-hoc fashion and you\'re looking\nfor a way to "productionize" them, Pachyderm can make this easy for you.\n\n## Features\n\n- Containerized: Pachyderm is built on Docker and Kubernetes. Whatever\n  languages or libraries your pipeline needs, they can run on Pachyderm which\n  can easily be deployed on any cloud provider or on prem.\n- Version Control: Pachyderm version controls your data as it\'s processed. You\n  can always ask the system how data has changed, see a diff, and, if something\n  doesn\'t look right, revert.\n- Provenance (aka data lineage): Pachyderm tracks where data comes from. Pachyderm keeps track of all the code and  data that created a result.\n- Parallelization: Pachyderm can efficiently schedule massively parallel\n  workloads.\n- Incremental Processing: Pachyderm understands how your data has changed and\n  is smart enough to only process the new data.\n\n## Getting Started\n[Install Pachyderm locally](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/getting_started/local_installation/) or [deploy on AWS/GCE/Azure](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/deploy-manage/deploy/amazon_web_services/) in about 5 minutes. \n\nYou can also refer to our complete [documentation](https://docs.pachyderm.com) to see tutorials, check out example projects, and learn about advanced features of Pachyderm.\n\nIf you\'d like to see some examples and learn about core use cases for Pachyderm:\n- [Examples](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/examples/examples/)\n- [Use Cases](https://www.pachyderm.com/use-cases/)\n- [Case Studies](https://www.pachyderm.com/case-studies/generalfusion/: Learn how [General Fusion](http://www.generalfusion.com/) uses Pachyderm to power commercial fusion research.\n\n## Documentation\n\n[Official Documentation](https://docs.pachyderm.com/)\n\n## Community\nKeep up to date and get Pachyderm support via:\n- [![Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/pachydermio.svg?style=social&label=Follow%20%40pachydermio)](https://twitter.com/pachyderminc) Follow us on Twitter.\n- [![Slack Status](http://slack.pachyderm.io/badge.svg)](http://slack.pachyderm.io) Join our community [Slack Channel](http://slack.pachyderm.io) to get help from the Pachyderm team and other users.\n\n### Contributing\n\nTo get started, sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://pachyderm.wufoo.com/forms/pachyderm-contributor-license-agreement).\n\nYou should also check out our [contributing guide](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/contributing/setup/).\n\nSend us PRs, we would love to see what you do!
