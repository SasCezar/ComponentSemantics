Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.\n\nUse Helm to:\n\n- Find and use [popular software packaged as Helm Charts](https://github.com/helm/charts) to run in Kubernetes\n- Share your own applications as Helm Charts\n- Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications\n- Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files\n- Manage releases of Helm packages\n\n## Helm in a Handbasket\n\nHelm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.\nThink of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.\n\n- Helm renders your templates and communicates with the Kubernetes API\n- Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD, or wherever you want it to run.\n- Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:\n  - A description of the package (`Chart.yaml`)\n  - One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files\n- Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories\n  (like Debian or RedHat packages)\n\n## Install\n\n\nBinary downloads of the Helm client can be found on [the Releases page](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/latest).\n\nUnpack the `helm` binary and add it to your PATH and you are good to go!\n\nIf you want to use a package manager:\n\n- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) users can use `brew install helm`.\n- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) users can use `choco install kubernetes-helm`.\n- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) users can use `scoop install helm`.\n- [GoFish](https://gofi.sh/) users can use `gofish install helm`.\n\nTo rapidly get Helm up and running, start with the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#quickstart-guide).\n\nSee the [installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for more options,\nincluding installing pre-releases.\n\n## Docs\n\nGet started with the [Quick Start guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) or plunge into the [complete documentation](https://helm.sh/docs)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe [Helm roadmap uses Github milestones](https://github.com/helm/helm/milestones) to track the progress of the project.\n\n## Community, discussion, contribution, and support\n\nYou can reach the Helm community and developers via the following channels:\n\n- [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com):\n  - [#helm-users](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/helm-users)\n  - [#helm-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/helm-dev)\n  - [#charts](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/charts)\n- Mailing List:\n  - [Helm Mailing List](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-helm)\n- Developer Call: Thursdays at 9:30-10:00 Pacific.
