b'# chef-bcpc\n\nchef-bcpc is a set of [Chef](https://github.com/opscode/chef) cookbooks that\nbuild a highly-available [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/) cloud.\n\nThe cloud consists of head nodes (OpenStack controller services, Ceph Mons,\netc.) and work nodes (hypervisors).\n\nEach head node runs all of the core services in a highly-available manner. Each\nwork node runs the relevant services (nova-compute, Ceph OSDs, etc.).\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe following instructions will get chef-bcpc up and running on your local\nmachine for development and testing purposes.\n\nSee the [Hardware Deployment][Hardware Deployment] section for notes on how to\ndeploy the chef-bcpc on hardware.\n\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* OS X or Linux\n* CPU that supports VT-x virtualization extensions\n* 16 GB of memory\n* 100 GB of free disk space\n* Vagrant 2.1+\n* VirtualBox 5.2+\n* git, curl, rsync, ssh, jq, make, ansible\n\n\n### Local Build\n\n* Review `virtual/topology/topology.yml` for the topology you will build and\nmake changes as required, e.g. assign more or less RAM based on your topology\nand your build environment. Other topologies exist in the same directory.\n* If a proxy server is required for internet access, set the variables TBD\n* If additional CA certificates are required (e.g. for a proxy), set the variables TBD\n* From the root of the chef-bcpc git repository run the following command:\n\nTo create a virtualbox build (the default):\n\n```shell\nmake create all\n```\n\nTo create a libvirt build:\n\n```shell\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt vagrant-mutate\nvagrant box add bento/ubuntu-18.04\nvagrant mutate bento/ubuntu-18.04 libvirt\nexport VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=libvirt\nmake create all\n```\n\nYou may also want to change cpu model from `qemu64` to `kvm64` in\n`ansible/playbooks/roles/common/defaults/main/chef.yml`\n\n```\nchef_environment:\n  name: virtual\n  override_attributes:\n    bcpc:\n       nova:\n         cpu_config:\n           cpu_mode: custom\n           cpu_model: kvm64\n```\n\n\n## Hardware Deployment\n\nTBD\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nCurrently, most development is done by a team at Bloomberg L.P. but we would\nlike to build a community around this project. PRs and issues are welcomed.
