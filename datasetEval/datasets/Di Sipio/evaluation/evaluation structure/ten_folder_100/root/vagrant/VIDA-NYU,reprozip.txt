A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).\n\nQuickstart\n----------\n\nWe have an [example repository](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/reprozip-examples) with a variety of different software. Don't hesitate to check it out, and contribute your own example if use ReproZip for something new!\n\n### Packing\n\nPacking experiments is only available for Linux distributions. In the environment where the experiment is originally executed, first install reprozip:\n\n    $ pip install reprozip\n\nThen, run your experiment with reprozip. Suppose you execute your experiment by originally running the following command:\n\n    $ ./myexperiment -my --options inputs/somefile.csv other_file_here.bin\n\nTo run it with reprozip, you just need to use the prefix *reprozip trace*:\n\n    $ reprozip trace ./myexperiment -my --options inputs/somefile.csv other_file_here.bin\n\nThis command creates a *.reprozip-trace* directory, in which you'll find the configuration file, named *config.yml*. You can edit the command line and environment variables, and choose which files to pack.\n\nIf you are using Debian or Ubuntu, most of these files (library dependencies) are organized by package. You can add or remove files, or choose not to include a package by changing option *packfiles* from true to false. In this way, smaller packs can be created with reprozip (if space is an issue), and reprounzip can download these files from the package manager; however, note this is only available for Debian and Ubuntu for now, and also be aware that package versions might differ. Choosing which files to pack is also important to remove sensitive information and third-party software that is not open source and should not be distributed.\n\nOnce done editing the configuration file (or even if you did not change anything), run the following command to create a ReproZip package named *my_experiment*:\n\n    $ reprozip pack my_experiment.rpz\n\nVoil&agrave;! Now your experiment has been packed, and you can send it to your collaborators, reviewers, and researchers around the world!\n\nNote that you can open the help message for any reprozip command by using the flag *-h*.\n\n### Unpacking\n\nDo you need to unpack an experiment in a Linux machine? Easy! First, install reprounzip:\n\n    $ pip install reprounzip\n\nThen, if you want to unpack everything in a single directory named *mydirectory* and execute the experiment from there, use the prefix *reprounzip directory*:\n\n    $ reprounzip directory setup my_experiment.rpz mydirectory\n    $ reprounzip directory run mydirectory\n\nIn case you prefer to build a chroot environment under *mychroot*, use the prefix *reprounzip chroot*:\n\n    $ reprounzip chroot setup my_experiment.rpz mychroot\n    $ reprounzip chroot run mychroot\n\nNote that the previous options do not interfere with the original configuration of the environment, so don't worry! If you are using Debian or Ubuntu, reprounzip also has an option to install all the library dependencies directly on the machine using package managers (rather than just copying the files from the .rpz package). Be aware that this will interfere in your environment and it may update your library packages, so use it at your own risk! For this option, just use the prefix *reprounzip installpkgs*:\n\n    $ reprounzip installpkgs my_experiment.rpz\n\nWhat if you want to reproduce the experiment in Windows or Mac OS X? You can build a virtual machine with the experiment! Easy as well! First, install the plugin reprounzip-vagrant:\n\n    $ pip install reprounzip-vagrant\n\nNote that (i) you must install reprounzip first, and (ii) the plugin requires having [Vagrant][vagrant] installed. Then, use the prefix *reprounzip vagrant* to create and start a virtual machine under directory *mytemplate*:\n\n    $ reprounzip vagrant setup my_experiment.rpz mytemplate\n\nTo execute the experiment, simply run:\n\n    $ reprounzip vagrant run mytemplate\n\nAlternatively, you may use [Docker][docker] containers to reproduce the experiment, which also works under Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows! First, install the plugin reprounzip-docker:\n\n    $ pip install reprounzip-docker\n\nThen, assuming that you want to create the container under directory *mytemplate*, simply use the prefix *reprounzip docker*:\n\n    $ reprounzip docker setup my_experiment.rpz mytemplate\n    $ reprounzip docker run mytemplate\n\nRemember that you can open the help message and learn more about other available flags and options by using the flag *-h* for any reprounzip command.\n\nCiting ReproZip\n---------------\n\nPlease use the following when citing ReproZip ([BibTeX](CITATION.txt)):\n\n    ReproZip: Computational Reproducibility With Ease\n    F.
