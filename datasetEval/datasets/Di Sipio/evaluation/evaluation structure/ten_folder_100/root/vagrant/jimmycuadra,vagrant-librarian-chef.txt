b'# vagrant-librarian-chef\n\n*WARNING: This project is no longer maintained. You should use [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) instead.*\n\nA [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) plugin to install\n[Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) cookbooks using\n[Librarian-Chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef).\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Vagrant version 1.2.0 or greater.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-librarian-chef\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nVagrant will automatically run Librarian-Chef before any provisioning step, so\nsimply set up your Cheffile as you normally would.\n\nYou may specify the subdirectory within which to run `librarian-chef`\nusing the `librarian_chef.cheffile_dir` config key.  Please keep in mind\nthat you will need to explicitly set the `cookbooks_path` in the\n`:chef_solo` provisioner:\n\n```ruby\nVagrant.configure("2") do |config|\n\n  config.librarian_chef.cheffile_dir = "chef"\n\n  config.vm.provision :chef_solo do |chef|\n    chef.cookbooks_path = "chef/cookbooks"\n\n    ...\n\n  end\nend\n```\n\nLibrarian-Chef can be configured normally via configuration file at `.librarian/chef/config`. Again, if you change the path where cookbooks are installed by Librarian-Chef, make sure your Vagrantfile is updated to tell Vagrant\'s Chef provisioner where to look for them via the `cookbooks_path` attribute.\n\nIf you want to programmtically disable the plugin without uninstalling it, set the `enabled` attribute to false:\n\n``` ruby\nconfig.librarian_chef.enabled = false\n```\n\n## Development\n\nVagrant 1.5.0 or greater is required.\n\n``` bash\nbundle\nbundle exec vagrant up\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThank you to [@thegcat](https://github.com/thegcat) and other contributors for their work on\n[vagrant-librarian](https://github.com/thegcat/vagrant-librarian), an earlier\nversion of this functionality for Vagrant 1.0.x and the original Librarian gem\nwith integrated Librarian-Chef.\n'
