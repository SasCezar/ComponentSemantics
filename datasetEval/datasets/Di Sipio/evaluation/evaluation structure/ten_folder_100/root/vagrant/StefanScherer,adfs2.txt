b"# Test AD FS 2\nTest infrastructure for AD FS 2.\n\nThe following boxes could be created:\n\n1. `dc` : The Active Directory Domain controller\n2. `adfs2` : The Active Directory Federation Service\n3. `web`: The Web Server running IIS\n4. `ps`: A Windows Print Server on Windows Server 2012 R2\n5. `ts`: A Windows Terminal Server\n\n## Installation\n\nThis `Vagrantfile` uses the [`vagrant-reload`](https://github.com/aidanns/vagrant-reload) plugin to reboot the Windows VM's during provisioning. If you don't have this plugin installed, do it now with\n\n```bash\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-reload\n```\n\nTo build the boxes, use `vagrant up` with the box name.\nEach box will be reboot twice until all features are up and running.\n\n### Create Domain Controller\nFirst create the AD domain controller\n\n```bash\nvagrant up dc\n```\n\nAfter that the domain `windomain.local` is up and running at IP address `192.168.38.2`.\nSome users will be created from the `users.csv` file.\nA special service user will be created for JBoss7 integration and its keytab file for SSO.\n\n### Create AD FS2 Server\nThis guest will join the domain and install the ADFS2.\n\n```bash\nvagrant up adfs2\n```\n\nI don't know if the ADFS2 is set up correctly. I just managed the domain join.\n\n### Create Web Server\nThis guest will join the domain and set up an IIS Web Server on host `web`.\n\n```bash\nvagrant up web\n```\n\nAfter installation, you have an IIS 7 Web Server, but also an [iisnode](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode) with Node.js up and running.\n\n* [http://web.windomain.local/](http://localhost:8080/)\n* [http://web.windomain.local/node](http://localhost:8080/node)\n\n\nThe guest will reboot twice until all features are up and running.\n\n## Normal Use\nAfter setting up all boxes, you simply can start and stop the boxes, but the\nDomain Controller should be started first and stopped last.\n\n```bash\nvagrant up dc\nvagrant up web\nvagrant halt web\nvagrant halt dc\n```\n"
