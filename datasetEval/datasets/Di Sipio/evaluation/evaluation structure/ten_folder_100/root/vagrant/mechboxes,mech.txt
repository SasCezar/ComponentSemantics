b"# mech\n\nI made this because I don't like VirtualBox and I wanted to use vagrant\nwith VMWare Fusion but was too cheap to buy the Vagrant plugin.\n\nhttps://blog.kchung.co/mech-vagrant-with-vmware-integration-for-free/\n\nUsage is pretty straightforward:\n\n```\nUsage: mech [options] <command> [<args>...]\n\nOptions:\n    -v, --version                    Print the version and exit.\n    -h, --help                       Print this help.\n    --debug                          Show debug messages.\n\nCommon commands:\n    (list|ls)         lists all available boxes\n    init              initializes a new Mech environment by creating a Mechfile\n    destroy           stops and deletes all traces of the Mech machine\n    (up|start)        starts and provisions the Mech environment\n    (down|stop|halt)  stops the Mech machine\n    suspend           suspends the machine\n    pause             pauses the Mech machine\n    ssh               connects to machine via SSH\n    ssh-config        outputs OpenSSH valid configuration to connect to the machine\n    scp               copies files to and from the machine via SCP\n    ip                outputs ip of the Mech machine\n    box               manages boxes: installation, removal, etc.\n    global-status     outputs status Mech environments for this user\n    status            outputs status of the Mech machine\n    ps                list running processes in Guest OS\n    provision         provisions the Mech machine\n    reload            restarts Mech machine, loads new Mechfile configuration\n    resume            resume a paused/suspended Mech machine\n    snapshot          manages snapshots: saving, restoring, etc.\n    port              displays information about guest port mappings\n    push              deploys code in this environment to a configured destination\n\nFor help on any individual command run `mech <command> -h`\n\nExample:\n\nInitializing and using a machine from HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud:\n\n    mech init bento/ubuntu-14.04\n    mech up\n    mech ssh\n```\n\n`mech init` can be used to pull a box file which will be installed and\ngenerate a Mechfile in the current directory. You can also pull boxes\nfrom Vagrant Cloud with `mech init freebsd/FreeBSD-11.1-RELEASE`.\nBarring that, `mech up <name>` can also be used to specify a vmx file\nto start.\n\n# Install\n\n`pip install -U mech`\n\nor for the latest:\n\n`pip install -U git+https://github.com/mechboxes/mech.git`\n\n# Shared Folders\n\nIf the box you init was created properly, you will be able to access\nthe host's current working directory in `/mnt/hgfs/mech`. If you are\nhaving trouble try running:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) open-vm-tools\n```\n\nfollowed by\n\n```bash\nsudo vmware-config-tools.pl\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nvmhgfs-fuse .host:/mech /mnt/hgfs\n```\n"
