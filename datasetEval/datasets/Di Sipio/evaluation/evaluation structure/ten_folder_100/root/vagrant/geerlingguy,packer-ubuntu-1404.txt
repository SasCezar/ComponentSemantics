b"# Packer Example - Ubuntu 14.04 minimal Vagrant Box\n\n> **DEPRECATED**: This project is no longer maintained, and though the base box is still available on Vagrant Cloud/Atlas, it will not be updated anymore as of 2019. Ubuntu 14.04 no longer receives active support from Canonical, therefore any users still running this version should upgrade to a newer, supported Ubuntu release.\n\n**Current Ubuntu Version Used**: 14.04.5\n\n**Pre-built Vagrant Box**:\n\n  - [`vagrant init geerlingguy/ubuntu1404`](https://vagrantcloud.com/geerlingguy/boxes/ubuntu1404)\n  - See older versions: http://files.midwesternmac.com/\n\nThis example build configuration installs and configures Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64 minimal using Ansible, and then generates a Vagrant box file for VirtualBox.\n\nThe example can be modified to use more Ansible roles, plays, and included playbooks to fully configure (or partially) configure a box file suitable for deployment for development environments.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following software must be installed/present on your local machine before you can use Packer to build the Vagrant box file:\n\n  - [Packer](http://www.packer.io/)\n  - [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/)\n  - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (if you want to build the VirtualBox box)\n  - [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html)\n\n## Usage\n\nMake sure all the required software (listed above) is installed, then cd to the directory containing this README.md file, and run:\n\n    $ packer build -var 'version=1.2.0' ubuntu1404.json\n\nAfter a few minutes, Packer should tell you the box was generated successfully, and the box was uploaded to Vagrant Cloud.\n\n> **Note**: This configuration includes a post-processor that pushes the built box to Vagrant Cloud (which requires a `VAGRANT_CLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable to be set); remove the `vagrant-cloud` post-processor from the Packer template to build the box locally and not push it to Vagrant Cloud. You don't need to specify a `version` variable either, if not using the `vagrant-cloud` post-processor.\n\n## Testing built boxes\n\nThere's an included Vagrantfile that allows quick testing of the built Vagrant boxes. From this same directory, run the following command after building the box:\n\n    $ vagrant up\n\n## License\n\nMIT license.\n\n## Author Information\n\nCreated in 2014 by [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/), author of [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/).\n"
