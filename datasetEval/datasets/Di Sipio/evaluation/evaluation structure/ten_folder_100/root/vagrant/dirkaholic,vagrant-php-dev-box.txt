b"Set up a PHP development box super fast\n=======================================\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/dirkaholic/vagrant-php-dev-box?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n* Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)\n* Install vagrant using the installation instructions in the [Getting Started document](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/)\n* Clone this repository and cd into it\n* Run ```vagrant up``` in order to set up the box using the ```ansible_local``` provisioner\n* You should now have your working \n    * Symfony2 Standard Edition under http://192.168.50.4:8081/\n    * Laravel Quickstart example app under http://192.168.50.4:8082/\n\nThe installation process will create a folder symfony-standard inside \nthe main directory of the repository. You can now start working inside \nthis folder directly on your host computer using your favourite IDE. \nChanges done there will be reflected directly on the vagrant box as the \ndirectory is mounted in the vagrant box under ```/vagrant```. Also you \ncan login into the box using ```vagrant ssh``` and have the full control \nover processes etc.\n\nAs the provisioning using the ansible provisioner is very fast you can \nrepeat the whole procedure at any time. In order to start fresh just run\n```vagrant destroy``` and ```vagrant up```. This will undo all you manual \nchanges done on the vagrant box and provide you with a clean setup.\n\nInstalled components\n--------------------\n\n* [Nginx](http://nginx.org)\n* [MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)\n* [PHP 7.0](http://www.php.net/)\n* [php-fpm](http://php-fpm.org)\n* [git](http://git-scm.com/)\n* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)\n* [Symfony2 Standard Edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard)\n* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)\n* [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/)\n\nIf you don't like/need some of the components just remove them from the roles section in playbook/vagrant.yml.\n\nChanges\n-------\n\n### unreleased\n### v1.4.1\n\n* Introduce php_version variable, set PHP default version to 7.0 [#33](https://github.com/dirkaholic/vagrant-php-dev-box/pull/33)\n* Upgrade Ubuntu box to 16.04 (latest LTS version) [#33](https://github.com/dirkaholic/vagrant-php-dev-box/pull/33)\n\n### v1.4.0\n\n* Transfer ansible playbooks to roles [#31](https://github.com/dirkaholic/vagrant-php-dev-box/pull/31)\n\n### v1.3.0\n\n* Switch provisioner to ansible [#18](https://github.com/dirkaholic/vagrant-php-dev-box/pull/18)\n\n### v1.0.0\n\n* Provision development environment using puppet\n"
