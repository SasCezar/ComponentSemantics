Use the res/providers/packer.sh script to build an appropriately patched packer binary.\n\n## Pending Tasks\n\nAdd retry function to scripts and wrap yum/apt/apk/pacman/etc (prototype in silent.sh already)  \nAutomatically retry failed box builds  \nGenerate docker variants for the RHEL/Oracle/Ubuntu/Debian/Alpine configurations  \nAdd upload/delete/release functions to robox.sh  \nAdd vagrant user password randomization logic to the bundled Vagrantfiles  \nAdd init based test, and SSH command test to the box test and check script  \nAd `IPQoS lowdelay throughput` to the relevant configs to solve the [OpenSSH bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10730)\n\n\n## Pending Additions\n\n[Devuan 1.0/2.0](https://devuan.org/)  \n\n## Operating System Requests\n\nThe following operating systems have been requested by a member of the robox community, but require a volunteer, so they can be incorporated into the robox workflow.\n\n[Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/get-haiku/)  \n[Minix](https://www.minix3.org/)  \n[Parrot](https://www.parrotsec.org/)  \n[SmartOS](https://www.joyent.com/smartos)\n\n## Operating System Candidates\n\nThe following operating systems are on my personal list, but haven't been added because of various resource contraints.\n\nManjaro  \nMint  \nOpenSolaris  \nOpenSUSE Leap v15 (already building v42.3)  \nOracle v6 (already building v7)  \nScientific Linux v6/v7  \nSlackware  \n\nMacOS  \nReactOS  \nWindows  \n\nTails  \nKali  \n\n## Donate\n\nThe roboxes are maintained by volunteers, and provided for free.
