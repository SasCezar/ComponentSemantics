b'# Golang Vagrant Environment\n\n[Golang](http://golang.org/) has a slightly more complex setup procedure\ncompared to other languages as it uses a *workspace* concept. Getting the\nenvironment wrong means many of the go commands fail with some what confusing\nerrors.\n\nThis repo aims to alleviate the problems starting a golang project by providing\na vagrant environment and puppet script that will setup and prepare all the\nrequired prerequisites.\n\n## Requirements\n\nIn order to use this repository you need the following:\n\n- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)\n- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)\n- [Puppet](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/installation.html)\n\n## Using vagrant-golang\n\nThis repo was developed to be copied and re-used as needed in other projects. It\nis only meant to make per project golang environments easier to manage. I have\ntried other golang modules for puppet and they didn\'t work as expected.\n\nClone or copy the repo and do the following:\n\n    $ cd /path/to/repo\n    $ vagrant up\n    $ vagrant ssh\n    # ...\n    $ go version\n    $ go install hello\n    $ hello\n    # hello, world\n\n## Choosing golang version\n\nThis repo is hardcoded to use 1.9 although this can easily be changed after\ncloning. If you want to use another version simply set the `$version` parameter\nwhen calling the class. The version string is taken from the\n[golang downloads list](http://golang.org/dl/). Once changed you can either call\n`vagrant up` if you haven\'t already setup the vagrant box or `vagrant provision`\nif the machine is already up.\n\n### Contributing\n\nAny contributions are welcome.
