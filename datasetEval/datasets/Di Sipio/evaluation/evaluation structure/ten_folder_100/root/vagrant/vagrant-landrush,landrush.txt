b'= Landrush: DNS for Vagrant\n:toc:\n:toc-placement!:\n\nimage:https://travis-ci.org/vagrant-landrush/landrush.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/vagrant-landrush/landrush"]\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/hferentschik/landrush-3agrx/branch/master[image:https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3iv8sv5v73s15mt6/branch/master?svg=true[Build Status]]\nimage:https://badge.fury.io/rb/landrush.svg["Gem Version", link="https://badge.fury.io/rb/landrush"]\n\nLandrush is a simple cross-platform DNS for Vagrant VMs that is visible\non both, the guest and the host.\n\nIt spins up a small DNS server and redirects DNS traffic from your VMs\nto use it, automatically registering/unregistering IP addresses of\nguests as they come up and go down.\n\n[NOTE]\n====\nThis project is currently _unmaintained_ and looking for maintainers! Anybody interested in helping out please contact @hferentschik.\n\nI\'d be happy to help coach anybody who wants to drop in and pick up the maintainer role for this plugin!\n====\n\n\'\'\'\ntoc::[]\n\'\'\'\n\n== Installation\n\nInstall under Vagrant (1.1 or later):\n\n....\n$ vagrant plugin install landrush\n....\n\n== Getting started\n\n.  Enable the plugin in your `Vagrantfile`:\n+\n....\nconfig.landrush.enabled = true\n....\n.  Bring up a machine.\n+\n....\n$ vagrant up\n....\n.  You are able to get your VM\'s hostname resolved on your host:\n+\n....\n$ dig -p 10053 @localhost myhost.vagrant.test\n....\n.  If you shut down your guest, the entries associated with it will be removed.\n\nLandrush retrieves your VM\'s hostname from either the vagrant config or\nit uses the system\'s actual hostname by running the `hostname` command.\nA default hostname of "guest-vm" is assumed if the hostname is otherwise not\navailable.\n\nA Landrush example configuration could look like this:\n\n....\nVagrant.configure("2") do |config|\n  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"\n\n  config.landrush.enabled = true\n\n  config.vm.hostname = "myhost.vagrant.test"\n\n  config.landrush.host \'static1.example.com\', \'1.2.3.4\'\n  config.landrush.host \'static2.example.com\', \'2.3.4.5\'\nend\n....\n\nSee the link:doc/Usage.adoc[Usage guide] for further information.\n\n== Available CLI commands\n\nCheck out `vagrant landrush help` for the available commands.\n\n....\nvagrant landrush <command>\n\ncommands:\n  {start|stop|restart|status}\n    control the landrush server daemon\n  list, ls\n    list all DNS entries known to landrush\n  dependentvms, vms\n    list vms currently dependent on the landrush server\n  set { <host> <ip> | <alias> <host> }\n    adds the given host-to-ip or alias-to-hostname mapping.\n    Existing host ip addresses will be overwritten\n  rm, del { <host> | <alias> | --all }\n    delete the given hostname or alias from the server.\n     --all removes all entries\n  help\n    you\'re lookin at it!\n....\n\n== Troubleshooting\n\nSee the link:doc/Troubleshooting.adoc[Troubleshooting guide] to resolve issues you face while using Landrush.\n\n== Help Out!\n\nThis project needs your feedback and help!
