These development\nenvironments can live on your computer or in the cloud, and are portable\nbetween Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nPackage dependencies: Vagrant requires `bsdtar` to be available on your system PATH to run successfully.\n\nFor the quick-start, we\'ll bring up a development machine on\n[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) because it is free and works\non all major platforms. Vagrant can, however, work with almost any\nsystem such as [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/), etc.\n\nFirst, make sure your development machine has\n[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)\ninstalled. After this,\n[download and install the appropriate Vagrant package for your OS](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).\n\nTo build your first virtual environment:\n\n    vagrant init hashicorp/bionic64\n    vagrant up\n\nNote: The above `vagrant up` command will also trigger Vagrant to download the\n`bionic64` box via the specified URL. Vagrant only does this if it detects that\nthe box doesn\'t already exist on your system.\n\n## Getting Started Guide\n\nTo learn how to build a fully functional development environment, follow the\n[getting started guide](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/index.html).\n\n## Installing from Source\n\nIf you want the bleeding edge version of Vagrant, we try to keep master pretty stable\nand you\'re welcome to give it a shot. Please review the installation page [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/source.html).\n\n## Contributing to Vagrant\n\nOnce your Vagrant bundle is installed from Git repository, you can run the test suite with:\n\n    bundle exec rake\n\nThis will run the unit test suite, which should come back all green!\n\nIf you are developing Vagrant on a machine that already has a Vagrant package installation present, both will attempt to use the same folder for their configuration (location of this folder depends on system). This can cause errors when Vagrant attempts to load plugins. In this case, override the `VAGRANT_HOME` environment variable for your development version of Vagrant before running any commands, to be some new folder within the project or elsewhere on your machine. For example, in Bash:\n\n    export VAGRANT_HOME=~/.vagrant-dev\n\nYou can now run Vagrant commands against the development version:\n\n    bundle exec vagrant\n\nPlease take time to read the [HashiCorp Community Guidelines](https://www.hashicorp.com/community-guidelines) and the [Vagrant Contributing Guide](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThen you\'re good to go!\n\n### Acceptance Tests\n\nVagrant also comes with an acceptance test suite that does black-box\ntests of various Vagrant components. Note that these tests are **extremely\nslow** because actual VMs are spun up and down. The full test suite can\ntake hours. Instead, try to run focused component tests.\n\nTo run the acceptance test suite, first copy `vagrant-spec.config.example.rb`\nto `vagrant-spec.config.rb` and modify it to valid values. The places you\nshould fill in are clearly marked.\n\nNext, see the components that can be tested:\n\n```\n$ rake acceptance:components\ncli\nprovider/virtualbox/basic\n...\n```\n\nThen, run one of those components:\n\n```\n$ rake acceptance:run COMPONENTS="cli"\n...\n```\n'
