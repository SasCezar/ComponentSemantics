See the HashiVim home page for\nfurther information.\n\n# vim-hashicorp-tools\n\nThis plugin combines all of my Vim plugins supporting the various\n[Hashicorp](https://hashicorp.com) tools into one plugin, for people who\nare likely to use more than one or two of them and want a one-stop shop.\nThe individual plugins are:\n\n-   [vim-consul](https://github.com/hashivim/vim-consul)\n-   [vim-nomadproject](https://github.com/hashivim/vim-nomadproject)\n-   [vim-ottoproject](https://github.com/hashivim/vim-ottoproject)\n-   [vim-packer](https://github.com/hashivim/vim-packer)\n-   [vim-terraform](https://github.com/hashivim/vim-terraform)\n-   [vim-vagrant](https://github.com/hashivim/vim-vagrant)\n-   [vim-vaultproject](https://github.com/hashivim/vim-vaultproject)\n\nPlease see the individual repositories above for further information\non each one. This repository is created by brute-force combining the\nothers with the `assemble.sh` script, so please file any issues or pull\nrequests against the individual repos, not this one. Thanks.\n\n## Installation\n\nWith [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:\n\n    cd ~/.vim/bundle\n    git clone https://github.com/hashivim/vim-hashicorp-tools.git\n\nIf you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.\n\n## Credits\n\nSee individual repositories for credits for the code contained within\nthem.
