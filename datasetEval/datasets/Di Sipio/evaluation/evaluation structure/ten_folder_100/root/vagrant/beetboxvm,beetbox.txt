b'# Beetbox - a pre-provisioned L*MP stack\n\nA VM for local L*MP development, built with Packer, Vagrant + Ansible\n\nBeetbox is essentially a pre-provisioned version of [Drupal VM](http://www.drupalvm.com/) mainly to speed up initial virtual machine build time, but also to reduce the size of each VM by leveraging [linked clones](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vagrant-1-8.html).\n\nWhilst it contains a set of default feature configuration, it is extremely extensible and almost anything can be overridden/extended with a simple YAML config file.\n\nIt is designed to have an instance (VM) per project and be integrated into a VCS like git, so that configuration can be easily shared within a team and a setup of a new project should be as simple as `git clone ...; vagrant up`.\n\nThis particular project contains the plumbing to manage the automated build of the pre-provisioned Vagrant base box, so almost all functionality is provided by ansible roles external to this project.\n\n[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/beetboxvm/beetbox.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/beetboxvm/beetbox)

Version](https://poser.pugx.org/beet/box/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/beet/box)\n[![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/beet/box/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/beet/box)\n[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/beet/box/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/beet/box)\n[![Docker](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/beet/box.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/beet/box/builds/)\n\n## What\'s different about this project?\n\n* It\'s a composer plugin which automatically creates a Vagrantfile.\n* You only add config to your project and don\'t need to manage a fork of the whole provisioning system.\n* It uses a pre-provisioned base box so it\xe2\x80\x99s much faster to provision.\n* Each new version of the box gets published to Atlas only if all roles are provisioned making the box always stable.\n* With linked clones each VM is a small clone of a single master.\n* You can reuse the same provisioning system for a CI environment.\n* Minimal host machine dependencies.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)\n* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) >= 1.8\n* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)\n* [Vagrant Hostsupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater)\n```\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater\n```\n* [Vagrant Auto-network](https://github.com/oscar-stack/vagrant-auto_network)\n```\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-auto_network\n```\n\n## Quickstart\n\n```\ncomposer require --dev beet/box\nvagrant up\n```\n\nThis will automatically generate a Vagrantfile and the `.beetbox` directory, which will contain a `config.yml` file used to configure overrides.\n\nYou can see some examples in [`config.yml`](https://github.com/beetboxvm/beetbox/blob/master/.beetbox/config.yml)\n\n## Updating\n\n```\ncomposer update beet/box\n```\n\nVersion constraints should automatically keep you to the same minor release. `(0.0.x)`\nHowever, you may need to update your configuation when upgrading minor releases. `(0.x.0)`\nSee the release notes for more information.\n\n## Drupal Quickstart\n\nTo get a simple Drupal 8 site up and running with Beetbox, run the following commands:\n\n```\ncomposer create-project drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev drupal8 --stability dev --no-interaction\ncd drupal8\ncomposer require --dev beet/box\nvagrant up\n```\n\nAfter which you can install the site at [http://drupal8.local/install.php](http://drupal8.local/install.php)\n\nor add the following to `./.beetbox/config.yml` and run `vagrant provision` to automatically install drupal:\n\n```\ndrupal_install_site: yes\ndrupal_account_name: admin\ndrupal_account_pass: admin\n```\n\nFor PHP 5.6 add `php_version: "5.6"` to `./.beetbox/config.yml`, then run `vagrant provision`.\n\n## Project roles.\n\nThese roles are mantained by Beetbox team.\n\n| Project | Build status |\n| --- | --- |\n|
