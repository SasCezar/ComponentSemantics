This is great news as it has allowed a number of outstanding\nPR\'s to be merged, with more to come.\n\nThere is also a Vagrantfile included for running the tests locally.\n\nThe next release will be v0.5.0, but no release date has been set at this point.\n\nMore to come...\n\nWhy use LXDock?\n===============\n\n**It\'s fast.** LXDock is much *much* faster than a typical Vagrant + Virtualbox setup.\n\n**Multi-arch.** Vagrant has been designed with Virtualbox and x86 in mind. Even if you use\nalternative providers, you\'re going to have to jump through inelegant hoops to have your\n``Vagrantfile`` work on x86 and arm (for example) at the same time because the very concept of a\nVagrant box is arch-specific.\n\n**Simpler.** When working with containers, much of the complexity of Vagrant becomes useless. Why\nthe need for special "vagrant-prepared" boxes when ``lxc exec`` is available? It\'s much simpler to\nuse whatever images are provided directly by lxd. By removing the need to manage boxes, ``lxdock``\nsuddenly becomes much simpler (a simple wrapper around lxd, really).\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nOnline browsable documentation is available at https://lxdock.readthedocs.io.\n\nHead over to the documentation for all the details on how to set up LXDock and how to start using\ncontainers in your project!\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nLXD_, Python 3.4+.
