It enables you to easily create custom apps for both user and bot identities (bot API alternative) via the [MTProto API](https://core.telegram.org/api#telegram-api).\n\n> [Pyrogram in fully-asynchronous mode is also available \xc2\xbb](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram/issues/181)\n>\n> [Working PoC of Telegram voice calls using Pyrogram \xc2\xbb](https://github.com/bakatrouble/pytgvoip)\n\n### Features\n\n- **Easy**: You can install Pyrogram with pip and start building your applications right away.\n- **Elegant**: Low-level details are abstracted and re-presented in a much nicer and easier way.\n- **Fast**: Crypto parts are boosted up by [TgCrypto](https://github.com/pyrogram/tgcrypto), a high-performance library\n  written in pure C.\n- **Documented**: Pyrogram API methods, types and public interfaces are well documented.\n- **Type-hinted**: Exposed Pyrogram types and method parameters are all type-hinted.\n- **Updated**, to make use of the latest Telegram API version and features.\n- **Bot API-like**: Similar to the Bot API in its simplicity, but much more powerful and detailed.\n- **Pluggable**: The Smart Plugin system allows to write components with minimal boilerplate code.\n- **Comprehensive**: Execute any advanced action an official client is able to do, and even more.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Python 3.5.3 or higher.\n- A [Telegram API key](https://docs.pyrogram.org/intro/setup#api-keys).\n\n### Installing\n\n``` bash\npip3 install pyrogram\n```\n\n### Resources\n\n- The Docs contain lots of resources to help you getting started with Pyrogram: https://docs.pyrogram.org.\n- Reading [Examples in this repository](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram/tree/master/examples) is also a good way\n  for learning how Pyrogram works.\n- Seeking extra help? Don\'t be shy, come join and ask our [Community](https://t.me/PyrogramChat)!\n- For other requests you can send an [Email](mailto:dan@pyrogram.org) or a [Message](https://t.me/haskell).\n\n### Contributing\n\nPyrogram is brand new, and **you are welcome to try it and help make it even better** by either submitting pull\nrequests or reporting issues/bugs as well as suggesting best practices, ideas, enhancements on both code\nand documentation.
