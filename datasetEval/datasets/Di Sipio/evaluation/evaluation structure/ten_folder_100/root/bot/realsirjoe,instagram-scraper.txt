b'# instagram_scraper\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realsirjoe/designs/master/flat_illustration.png" align="right">\nThis is a minimalistic Instagram scraper written in Python.\n<br /><br />\nIt can fetch media, accounts, videos, comments etc.\n`Comment` and `Like` actions are also supported.\n\nIt is not easy to get Applications approved for Instagram\'s API therefore I created this tool inspired by [instagram-php-scraper](https://github.com/postaddictme/instagram-php-scraper).\n<br /><br />\nThe goal of this project is to become as minimalistic as possible while still having all the needed functionality so that its easy to add code to it!\n\nAny \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f or contribution is appreciated if you like the project \xf0\x9f\xa4\x98\n\n## How to install\nSimply run:\n```\npip install igramscraper\n```\n\nor download the project via git clone and run the following:\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Usages\nSome methods do require authentication:\n```python\n\nfrom igramscraper.instagram import Instagram\n\ninstagram = Instagram()\n\n# authentication supported\ninstagram.with_credentials(\'username\', \'password\')\ninstagram.login()\n\n#Getting an account by id\naccount = instagram.get_account_by_id(3)\n\n# Available fields\nprint(\'Account info:\')\nprint(\'Id: \', account.identifier)\nprint(\'Username: \', account.username)\nprint(\'Full name: \', account.full_name)\nprint(\'Biography: \', account.biography)\nprint(\'Profile pic url: \', account.get_profile_pic_url_hd())\nprint(\'External Url: \', account.external_url)\nprint(\'Number of published posts: \', account.media_count)\nprint(\'Number of followers: \', account.followed_by_count)\nprint(\'Number of follows: \', account.follows_count)\nprint(\'Is private: \', account.is_private)\nprint(\'Is verified: \', account.is_verified)\n\n# or simply for printing use \nprint(account)\n```\nIf you use authentication, the program will cache the user session by default so one doesn\'t need to create session every time.  \nIf one want to disable the user session cache, assign `True` to Instagram.login() method\n\nTwo Factor Authentication is also supported through cli interface, simply use \'True\' for second argument of login() function \n  \nMany of the methods do not require authentication\n\nfor more info browse through the examples folder\n\nUsing proxy for requests:\n```python\nfrom igramscraper.instagram import Instagram \n\nproxies = {\n    \'http\': \'http://123.45.67.8:1087\',\n    \'https\': \'http://123.45.67.8:1087\',\n}\n\ninstagram = Instagram()\ninstagram.set_proxies(proxies)\n\naccount = instagram.get_account(\'kevin\')\nprint(account.identifier)\n```\n\n## Recommended Limits\nIf you make too many requests too fast you will get a 429 Error or something similar.\n- It is recommended to make a short break between each request of 30s (+- random)\n- In between all 10 requests a long break (300-600s)\n\nIf different proxies and accounts are used for all requests and the circle doesn\'t repeat too fast these limits don\'t apply ;)\n\nFeel free to make your own tests and let us know of any limits you experienced\n\n## More usages\nSee examples [here](https://github.com/SergioWagenleitner/instagram-scraper/tree/master/examples).\n\n## How to contribute\nEvery contribution is welcome, check out our [TODOs](https://github.com/realsirjoe/instagram-scraper/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n<br />\nand join our telegram group: https://t.me/joinchat/J86yTBAtZlEi-6T6LOxijw\n\n## Other\ninstagram-php-scraper [here](https://github.com/postaddictme/instagram-php-scraper/)\n'
