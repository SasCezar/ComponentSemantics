You don\'t have time to check social media and you want to give attention to someone so that she notices you.\n - You are in a relationship. Your girlfriend is constantly nagging you for not being the \'first-one\' to like her Instagram pics.\n\n How does it work?\n================  \n This script runs Instagram API every 15mins (cronjob) and checks for any new Instagram post for a paticular `user_id`. If a new a post is found it likes the post and sends a notification to your configured Slack channel using Slack Webhooks.\n\nInstallation\n===============\n\n - `git clone https://github.com/gulzar1996/auto-like-my-gf-insta-pic`\n - `npm install`\n - create a `.env` file (you must set `accessToken`, `user_id` (Target user id) from [Instagram Developer API](https://www.instagram.com/developer) and `slack_url` from [Slack Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) ) as shown.\n ![.env file](/env.png)\n This would assure that your keys are secured and index.js file is untouched.\n - `npm start` (run the app)\n\nLike all the recent instagram post (test)\n\n     GET http://localhost:3000/run\n\nDeploy to Heroku\n================\n\n - `cd auto-like-my-gf-insta-pic`\n - `heroku login`\n - `heroku create` (add heroku to project)\n - `git push heroku master` (deploy to heroku)\n - `heroku ps:scale worker=1` (start dyno worker)\n\n Heroku will generate a url for you\n\n      http://<HEROKU_URL>.herokuapp.com/run\n\nSetting up Cron Job   \n===================\n\n - create an account [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/en/)\n - create a cronjob\n - paste the url `http://<HEROKU_URL>.herokuapp.com/run` in address\n - schedule every `15 mins`\n\n Using node-cron (local cron)\n ===============\n - `npm start` (run the app)\n - `node cron.js &` create a node-cron that sends GET to the app every 15 min\n - `ps` to list background processes\n - `kill <process id>` to stop the node-cron\n \n \nDocker Setup\n===================\n\n - Docker >= 17.x, docker-compose >= 1.x\n - Specify environment values in docker-compose.yml.\n - Run `docker-compose up`\n \n ## TODO\n- [ ] Twitter Support\n- [ ] Like only pictures of Gf/Bf (face recognition)\n\n  \n Thanks\n=================\n\nInspired from https://github.com/cyandterry/Like-My-GF. Code written in JS from scratch.\n'
