See [here](https://github.com/discordrb/discordrb/wiki/Installing-libopus) for installation instructions.\n* [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed and in your PATH\n\nIn addition to this, if you\'re on Windows and want to use voice functionality, your installed Ruby version **needs to be 32 bit**, as otherwise Opus won\'t work.\n\n## Installation\n\n### With Bundler\n\nUsing [Bundler](https://bundler.io/#getting-started), you can add discordrb to your Gemfile:\n\n    gem \'discordrb\'\n\nAnd then install via `bundle install`.\n\nRun the [ping example](https://github.com/discordrb/discordrb/blob/master/examples/ping.rb) to verify that the installation works (make sure to replace the token and client ID in there with your bots\'!):\n\nTo run the bot while using bundler:\n\n    bundle exec ruby ping.rb\n\n### With Gem\n\nAlternatively, while Bundler is the recommended option, you can also install discordrb without it.\n\n#### Linux / macOS\n\n    gem install discordrb\n\n#### Windows\n\n> **Make sure you have the DevKit installed! See the [Dependencies](https://github.com/discordrb/discordrb#dependencies) section)**\n\n    gem install discordrb --platform=ruby\n\nTo run the bot:\n\n    ruby ping.rb\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\n**If you get an error like this when installing the gem**:\n\n    ERROR:  Error installing discordrb:\n            The \'websocket-driver\' native gem requires installed build tools.\n\nYou\'re missing the development kit required to build native extensions.\n\n##### RubyInstaller for ruby 2.4.3-2 and above\n\nRubyInstaller after version 2.3.3 now includes the development kit in the installer. If you do not have the development kit and have installed ruby using RubyInstaller, open a command prompt with administrator privileges and run:\n\n    ridk install\n\nSelect option 3, and then run\n\n    ridk enable\n\nTo enable the changes\n\n**If Ruby complains about `ffi_c` not being able to be found:**\n\nFor example\n\n    C:/Ruby25-x64/lib/ruby/2.5.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:55:in `require\': cannot load such file -- ffi_c (LoadError)\n\nYour ffi setup is screwed up, first run `gem uninstall ffi` (uninstall all versions if it asks you, say yes to any unmet dependencies), then run `gem install ffi --platform=ruby` to fix it. If it says something about build tools, follow the steps in the first troubleshooting section.\n\n**If you\'re having trouble getting voice playback to work**:\n\nLook here: https://github.com/discordrb/discordrb/wiki/Voice-sending#troubleshooting\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can make a simple bot like this:\n\n```ruby\nrequire \'discordrb\'\n\nbot = Discordrb::Bot.new token: \'<token here>\'\n\nbot.message(with_text: \'Ping!\') do |event|\n  event.respond \'Pong!\'\nend\n\nbot.run\n```\n\nThis bot responds to every "Ping!" with a "Pong!".\n\nSee [additional examples here](https://github.com/discordrb/discordrb/tree/master/examples).\n\nYou can find examples of projects that use discordrb by [searching for the discordrb topic on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/discordrb).\n\nIf you\'ve made an open source project on GitHub that uses discordrb, consider adding the `discordrb` topic to your repo!\n\n## Webhooks Client\n\nAlso included is a webhooks client, which can be used as a separate gem `discordrb-webhooks`. This special client can be used to form requests to Discord webhook URLs in a high-level manner.\n\n- [`discordrb-webhooks` documentation](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/discordrb-webhooks)\n- [More information about webhooks](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)\n- [Embed visualizer tool](https://leovoel.github.io/embed-visualizer/) - Includes a discordrb code generator for forming embeds\n\n### Usage\n\n```ruby\nrequire \'discordrb/webhooks\'\n\nWEBHOOK_URL = \'https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/424070213278105610/yByxDncRvHi02mhKQheviQI2erKkfRRwFcEp0MMBfib1ds6ZHN13xhPZNS2-fJo_ApSw\'.freeze\n\nclient = Discordrb::Webhooks::Client.new(url: WEBHOOK_URL)\nclient.execute do |builder|\n  builder.content = \'Hello world!\'\n  builder.add_embed do |embed|\n    embed.title = \'Embed title\'\n    embed.description = \'Embed description\'\n    embed.timestamp = Time.now\n  end\nend\n```\n\n**Note:** The `discordrb` gem relies on `discordrb-webhooks`. If you already have `discordrb` installed, `require \'discordrb/webhooks\'` will include all of the `Webhooks` features as well.\n\n## Support\n\nYou can find me (@meew0, ID 66237334693085184) on the unofficial Discord API server - if you have a question, just ask there, I or somebody else will probably answer you: https://discord.gg/3Trm6FW\n\n## Development\n\n**This section is for developing discordrb itself! If you just want to make a bot, see the [Installation](https://github.com/discordrb/discordrb#installation) section.**\n\nAfter checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can then run tests via `bundle exec rspec spec`. Make sure to run rubocop also: `bundle exec rubocop`. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.\n\nTo install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).\n\n## Contributing\n\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/discordrb/discordrb.\n\n## License\n\nThe gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n'
