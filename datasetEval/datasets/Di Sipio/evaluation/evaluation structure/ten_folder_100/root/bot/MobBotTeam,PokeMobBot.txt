Keep in mind that many of the API calls made by us ( and every other open source Bot out there ) are wrong. They will most likely flag you and get you banned.<br>\nThats why we started to work on a new Bot some while ago. MobBot Redux will feature a fully modular architecture, Plugins API and a totally redone API that focuses on emulating the client.
