It provides all the boilerplate code needed so that you\ncan make your bot live right away.\n\n## Why use JBot?\n\n* Provides you with __all the boilerplate code__ which handles underlying websocket connections and other complexities.\n* Supports __extra events__ in addition to all the events supported by Slack/Facebook which makes your work a lot more easier.\n* __Receiving & sending messages__ is as easy as defining a `@Controller` and calling `reply()`.\n* __Conversation feature__ of JBot makes talking to your bot a breeze. This feature makes JBot different than rest of the Java frameworks out there.\n* __Well tested__ with good coverage unit tests.\n* And many other features which can\'t just be mentioned here.\n\n**Not satisfied?** Read on...\n\n* JBot got more than __400 stars__ in just 2 days after release.\n* It is in the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12239667) 50 club.\n* Chosen by [DZone daily picks](http://mailer.dzone.com/display.php?M=15184241&C=dcebb6887365120539df1fbf19a071ed&S=9043&L=658&N=4604).\n* Last but not the least, it\'s listed on [Slack.com](https://api.slack.com/community)\n\n**Still worried?** Open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot/issues) and we can discuss.\n\n## JBot for Slack\n\n**Running your SlackBot is just 4 easy steps:**\n  \n1. Clone this project `$ git clone git@github.com:rampatra/jbot.git`.  \n2. [Create a slack bot](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) and get your slack token.  \n3. Paste the token in [application.properties](/jbot-example/src/main/resources/application.properties) file.  \n4. Run the example application by running `JBotApplication` in your IDE or via commandline: \n    ```bash\n    $ cd jbot\n    $ mvn clean install\n    $ cd jbot-example\n    $ mvn spring-boot:run\n    ```\n\nYou can now start talking with your bot ;)\n\nRead the detailed [Slack documentation](/docs/slack/README-Slack-JBot-4.0.0.md) to learn more.\n\n## JBot for Facebook\n\n**Similar to Slack, Facebook is simple too but has few extra steps:**\n\n1. Clone this project `$ git clone git@github.com:rampatra/jbot.git`.\n2. Create a [facebook app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register#create-app) and a \n[page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create).\n3. Generate a Page Access Token for the page (inside app\'s messenger settings).\n4. Paste the token created above in [application.properties](/jbot-example/src/main/resources/application.properties) file.\n5. Run the example application by running `JBotApplication` in your IDE or via commandline: \n    ```bash\n    $ cd jbot\n    $ mvn clean install\n    $ cd jbot-example\n    $ mvn spring-boot:run\n    ```\n6. Setup webhook to receive messages and other events. You need to have a public address to setup webhook. You may use\n[localtunnel.me](https://localtunnel.me) to generate a public address if you\'re running locally on your machine.\n7. Specify the address created above in "Callback Url" field under "Webooks" setting and give the verify token \nas `fb_token_for_jbot` and click "Verify and Save".\n\nYou can now start messaging your bot by going to the facebook page and clicking on the "Send message" button. \n\n_If you\'re too lazy to start now and just want to play around, you can try `jbot-example` by visiting \n[JBot facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/jbotframework/) and clicking on the "Send Message" button._\n\nRead the detailed [Facebook documentation](/docs/facebook/README-Facebook-JBot-4.0.0.md) to learn more.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the awesome people who contribute.
