You can [subscribe here](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/2aud-io) to be part of the first ones.\n\n## Introduction\n\nLeon is an **open-source personal assistant** who can live **on your server**.\n\nHe **does stuff** when you **ask him for**.\n\nYou can **talk to him** and he can **talk to you**.\nYou can also **text him** and he can also **text you**.\nIf you want to, Leon can communicate with you by being **offline to protect your privacy**.\n\n### Why?\n\n> 1. If you are a developer (or not), you may want to build many things that could help in your daily life.\n> Instead of building a dedicated project for each of those ideas, Leon can help you with his\n> packages/modules (skills) structure.\n> 2. With this generic structure, everyone can create their own modules and share them with others.\n> Therefore there is only one core (to rule them all).\n> 3. Leon uses AI concepts, which is cool.\n> 4. Privacy matters, you can configure Leon to talk with him offline. You can already text with him without any third party services.\n> 5. Open source is great.\n\n### What is this repository for?\n\n> This repository contains the following nodes of Leon:\n> - The server\n> - The packages/modules\n> - The web app\n> - The hotword node\n\n### What is Leon able to do?\n\n> Today, the most interesting part is about his core and the way he can scale up. He is pretty young but can easily scale to have new features (packages/modules).\n> You can find what he is able to do by browsing the [packages list](https://github.com/leon-ai/leon/tree/develop/packages).\n\nSounds good for you?
