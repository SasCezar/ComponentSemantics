Anytime a user interacts with an AI using natural language, their words need to be translated into a machine-readable description of what they meant.\n\nThe NLU engine first detects what the intention of the user is (a.k.a. `intent`_), then extracts the parameters (called `slots`_) of the query. The developer can then use this to determine the appropriate action or response.\n\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s take an example to illustrate this, and consider the following sentence:\n\n.. code-block:: text\n\n    "What will be the weather in paris at 9pm?"\n\nProperly trained, the Snips NLU engine will be able to extract structured data such as:\n\n.. code-block:: json\n\n    {\n       "intent": {\n          "intentName": "searchWeatherForecast",\n          "probability": 0.95\n       },\n       "slots": [\n          {\n             "value": "paris",\n             "entity": "locality",\n             "slotName": "forecast_locality"\n          },\n          {\n             "value": {\n                "kind": "InstantTime",\n                "value": "2018-02-08 20:00:00 +00:00"\n             },\n             "entity": "snips/datetime",\n             "slotName": "forecast_start_datetime"\n          }\n       ]\n    }\n\nIn this case, the identified intent is ``searchWeatherForecast`` and two slots were extracted, a locality and a datetime. As you can see, Snips NLU does an extra step on top of extracting entities: it resolves them. The extracted datetime value has indeed been converted into a handy ISO format.\n\nCheck out our `blog post`_ to get more details about why we built Snips NLU and how it works under the hood. We also published a `paper on arxiv`_, presenting the machine learning architecture of the Snips Voice Platform.\n\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\n-------------------\nSystem requirements\n-------------------\n\n- Python 2.7 or Python >= 3.5\n- RAM: Snips NLU will typically use between 100MB and 200MB of RAM, depending on the language and the size of the dataset.\n\n\n------------\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    pip install snips-nlu\n\nWe currently have pre-built binaries (wheels) for ``snips-nlu`` and its\ndependencies for MacOS (10.11 and later), Linux x86_64 and Windows.\n\nFor any other architecture/os `snips-nlu` can be installed from the source\ndistribution. To do so, `Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html>`_\nand `setuptools_rust <https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust>`_ must be\ninstalled before running the ``pip install snips-nlu`` command.\n\n------------------\nLanguage resources\n------------------\n\nSnips NLU relies on `external language resources`_ that must be downloaded before the\nlibrary can be used. You can fetch resources for a specific language by\nrunning the following command:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n    python -m snips_nlu download en\n\nOr simply:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n    snips-nlu download en\n\n\nThe list of supported languages is available at \n`this address <https://snips-nlu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/languages.html>`_.\n\nAPI Usage\n---------\n\n----------------------\nCommand Line Interface\n----------------------\n\nThe easiest way to test the abilities of this library is through the command line interface.\n\nFirst, start by training the NLU with one of the `sample datasets`_:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n    \n    snips-nlu train path/to/dataset.json path/to/output_trained_engine\n\nWhere ``path/to/dataset.json`` is the path to the dataset which will be used during training, and ``path/to/output_trained_engine`` is the location where the trained engine should be persisted once the training is done.\n\nAfter that, you can start parsing sentences interactively by running:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n    \n    snips-nlu parse path/to/trained_engine\n\nWhere ``path/to/trained_engine`` corresponds to the location where you have stored the trained engine during the previous step.\n\n\n-----------\nSample code\n-----------\n\nHere is a sample code that you can run on your machine after having\ninstalled `snips-nlu`, fetched the english resources and downloaded one of the `sample datasets`_:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> from __future__ import unicode_literals, print_function\n    >>> import io\n    >>> import json\n    >>> from snips_nlu import SnipsNLUEngine\n    >>> from snips_nlu.default_configs import CONFIG_EN\n    >>> with io.open("sample_datasets/lights_dataset.json") as f:\n    ...     sample_dataset = json.load(f)\n    >>> nlu_engine = SnipsNLUEngine(config=CONFIG_EN)\n    >>> nlu_engine = nlu_engine.fit(sample_dataset)\n    >>> text = "Please turn the light on in the kitchen"\n    >>> parsing = nlu_engine.parse(text)\n    >>> parsing["intent"]["intentName"]\n    \'turnLightOn\'\n\n\nWhat it does is training an NLU engine on a sample weather dataset and parsing\na weather query.\n\nSample datasets\n---------------\n\nHere is a list of some datasets that can be used to train a Snips NLU engine:\n\n- `Lights dataset <sample_datasets/lights_dataset.json>`_: "Turn on the lights in the kitchen", "Set the light to red in the bedroom"\n- `Beverage dataset <sample_datasets/beverage_dataset.json>`_: "Prepare two cups of cappucino", "Make me a cup of tea"\n- `Flights dataset <sample_datasets/flights_dataset.json>`_: "Book me a flight to go to boston this weekend", "book me some tickets from istanbul to moscow in three days"\n\nBenchmarks\n----------\n\nIn January 2018, we reproduced an `academic benchmark`_ which was published during the summer 2017. In this article, authors assessed the performance of API.ai (now Dialogflow, Google), Luis.ai (Microsoft), IBM Watson, and `Rasa NLU`_. For fairness, we used an updated version of Rasa NLU and compared it to the latest version of Snips NLU (both in dark blue).\n\n.. image:: .img/benchmarks.png\n\nIn the figure above, `F1 scores`_ of both intent classification and slot filling were computed for several NLU providers, and averaged accross the three datasets used in the academic benchmark mentionned before.
