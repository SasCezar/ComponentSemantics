Designed for scripting and automation.\n\n[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/blob/master/LICENSE)\n[![Swift 4.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Swift_4.2-orange.svg)](https://swift.org)\n[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/mas-cli/mas.svg)](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/releases)\n[![Reviewed by Hound](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reviewed_by-Hound-8E64B0.svg)](https://houndci.com)\n[![Pipeline Status](https://jenkins.log-g.co/buildStatus/icon?job=mas-cli/mas/master)](https://jenkins.log-g.co/job/mas-cli/job/mas/job/master/)\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x93\xb2 Install\n\n### \xf0\x9f\x8d\xba Homebrew\n\n[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is the preferred way to install:\n\n```bash\nbrew install mas\n```\n\n### \xe2\x98\x8e\xef\xb8\x8f Older macOS Versions\n\nmacOS 10.13 (High Sierra) is required to install mas from the core Homebrew formula.\nWe provide a [custom Homebrew tap](https://github.com/mas-cli/homebrew-tap) with pre-built bottles\nfor all macOS versions since 10.11.\n\n#### \xf0\x9f\x98\xb4 TL;DR\n\nJust run this command:\n\n```bash\nbrew install mas-cli/tap/mas\n```\n\n### \xf0\x9f\x90\x99 GitHub Releases\n\nAlternatively, binaries are available in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/releases)\n\n## \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb3\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb Usage\n\nEach application in the Mac App Store has a product identifier which is also\nused for mas-cli commands. Using `mas list` will show all installed\napplications and their product identifiers.\n\n```bash\n$ mas list\n446107677 Screens\n407963104 Pixelmator\n497799835 Xcode\n```\n\nIt is possible to search for applications by name using `mas search` which\nwill search the Mac App Store and return matching identifiers.\nInclude the `--price` flag to include prices in the result.\n\n```bash\n$ mas search Xcode\n497799835 Xcode\n688199928 Docs for Xcode\n449589707 Dash 3 - API Docs & Snippets. Integrates with Xcode, Alfred, TextWrangler and many more.\n[...]\n```\n\nTo install or update an application simply run `mas install` with an\napplication identifier:\n\n```bash\n$ mas install 808809998\n==> Downloading PaintCode 2\n==> Installed PaintCode 2\n```\n\nIf you want to install the first result that the `search` command returns, use the `lucky` command.\n\n```bash\n$ mas lucky twitter\n==> Downloading Twitter\n==> Installed Twitter\n```\n\n> Please note that this command will not allow you to install (or even purchase) an app for the first time:\nit must already be in the Purchased tab of the App Store.\n\nUse `mas outdated` to list all applications with pending updates.\n\n```bash\n$ mas outdated\n497799835 Xcode (7.0)\n446107677 Screens VNC - Access Your Computer From Anywhere (3.6.7)\n```\n\n> `mas` is only able to install/update applications that are listed in the Mac App Store itself.\nUse [`softwareupdate(8)`] utility for downloading system updates (like iTunes, Xcode Command Line Tools, etc)\n\nTo install all pending updates run `mas upgrade`.\n\n```bash\n$ mas upgrade\nUpgrading 2 outdated applications:\nXcode (7.0), Screens VNC - Access Your Computer From Anywhere (3.6.7)\n==> Downloading Xcode\n==> Installed Xcode\n==> Downloading iFlicks\n==> Installed iFlicks\n```\n\nUpdates can be performed selectively by providing the app identifier(s) to\n`mas upgrade`\n\n```bash\n$ mas upgrade 715768417\nUpgrading 1 outdated application:\nXcode (8.0)\n==> Downloading Xcode\n==> Installed Xcode\n```\n\n### \xf0\x9f\x9a\x8f\xf0\x9f\x93\xa5 Sign-in\n\nTo sign into the Mac App Store for the first time run `mas signin`.\n\n```bash\n$ mas signin mas@example.com\n==> Signing in to Apple ID: mas@example.com\nPassword:\n```\n\n> \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f Due to breaking changes in the underlying API that mas uses to interact with the Mac App Store,\n> the `signin` command has been temporarily disabled on macOS 10.13+ \xe2\x9b\x94.\n> For more information on this issue, see [#164](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/issues/164).\n\nIf you experience issues signing in this way, you can ask to signin using a graphical dialog (provided by Mac App Store application):\n\n```bash\n$ mas signin --dialog mas@example.com\n==> Signing in to Apple ID: mas@example.com\n```\n\nYou can also embed your password in the command.\n\n```bash\n$ mas signin mas@example.com \'ZdkM4f$gzF;gX3ABXNLf8KcCt.x.np\'\n==> Signing in to Apple ID: mas@example.com\n```\n\nUse `mas signout` to sign out from the Mac App Store.\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x8d\xba Homebrew integration\n\n`mas` is integrated with [homebrew-bundle]. If `mas` is installed, and you run `brew bundle dump`,\nthen your Mac App Store apps will be included in the Brewfile created. See the [homebrew-bundle]\ndocs for more details.\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x92\xa5 When something doesn\'t work\n\nIf you see the error "This redownload is not available for this Apple ID either because it was bought by a different user of the item was refunded or cancelled.", it\'s probably because you haven\'t installed the app through the App Store yet. See [#46](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/issues/46#issuecomment-248581233).\n\nIf `mas` doesn\'t work for you as expected (e.g. you can\'t update/download apps), run `mas reset` and try again. If the issue persists, please [file a bug](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas/issues/new)! All your feedback is much appreciated \xe2\x9c\xa8\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x93\xba Using `tmux`\n\n`mas` operates via the same system services as the Mac App Store. These exist as\nseparate processes with communication through XPC. As a result of this, `mas`\nexperiences similar problems as the pasteboard when running inside `tmux`. A\n[wrapper tool exists](https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard) to\nfix pasteboard behaviour which also works for `mas`.\n\nYou should consider configuring `tmux` to use the wrapper but if you do not wish\nto do this it can be used on a one-off basis as follows:\n\n```bash\nbrew install reattach-to-user-namespace\nreattach-to-user-namespace mas install\n```\n\n## \xe2\x84\xb9\xef\xb8\x8f Build from source\n\nYou can now build from Xcode by opening `mas-cli.xcodeproj`, or from the Terminal:\n\n```bash\nscript/build\n```\n\nBuild output can be found in the `build/` directory within the project.\n\n## \xe2\x9c\x85 Tests\n\nThe tests in this project are a recent work-in-progress.\nSince Xcode does not officially support tests for command-line tool targets,\nall logic is part of the MasKit target with tests in MasKitTests.\nTests are written using [Quick].\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x93\x84 License\n\nmas-cli was created by [@argon](https://github.com/argon).\nCode is under the [MIT license](LICENSE).\n\n[homebrew-bundle]: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle\n[mas-cli]: https://github.com/mas-cli/mas\n[`softwareupdate(8)`]: https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/softwareupdate.8.html\n[Quick]: https://github.com/Quick/Quick\n'
