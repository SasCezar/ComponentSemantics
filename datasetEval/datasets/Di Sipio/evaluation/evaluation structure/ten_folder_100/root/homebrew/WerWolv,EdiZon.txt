Download the latest release from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/WerWolv/EdiZon/releases/latest).\r\n  2. Unpack the downloaded zip file, put the files on your Nintendo Switch\'s SD card and let the folders merge.\r\n  3. Use a free open source CFW like [Atmosph\xc3\xa8re](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) to launch the hbmenu and start EdiZon from there.\r\n     1. If you want to use the cheat manager you absolutely have to use [Atmosph\xc3\xa8re](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) as only their cheats are supported.\r\n     2. For the best experience, open the `/atmosphere/system_settings.ini` file and change `dmnt_cheats_enabled_by_default = u8!0x1` to `dmnt_cheats_enabled_by_default = u8!0x0`.\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to compile\r\n\r\n  1. Clone the EdiZon repo to your computer using `git clone https://github.com/WerWolv/EdiZon`.\r\n  2. Download and install devkitA64. It comes bundled with the [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org) toolchain.\r\n  3. Use the pacman package manager that comes with devkitPro to download and install libNX, portlibs (`switch-portlibs`) and freetype2 (`switch-freetype`).\r\n  4. The rest of the compilation works using the `make` command.\r\n\r\n# Discord\r\n\r\n  For support with the usage of EdiZon or the creation of save editor configs and scripts, feel free to join the EdiZon server on Discord: https://discord.gg/qyA38T8\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n\r\n  Thanks to...\r\n\r\n  - [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org) for their amazing toolchain!\r\n  - [3096](https://github.com/3096) for [save dumping/injecting](https://github.com/3096/nut)\r\n  - [Bernardo Giordano](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano) for some code from [Checkpoint](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/Checkpoint).\r\n  - [SwitchBrew](https://switchbrew.org/) for the [Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/switchbrew/nx-hbmenu) GUI and shared font code.\r\n  - [thomasnet-mc](https://github.com/thomasnet-mc/) for most of the save backup and restore code and the updater script.\r\n  - [trueicecold](https://github.com/trueicecold) for batch backups and the editable-only mode.\r\n  - [onepiecefreak](https://github.com/onepiecefreak3) for the edizon debugger and LOTS of reviewing implementations.\r\n  - [Jojo](https://github.com/drdrjojo) for the Travis CI configuration and the config creator.\r\n  - [Ac_K](https://github.com/AcK77) for help with the server side update scripts and the EdiZon save website.\r\n  - [jakibaki](https://github.com/jakibaki) for his massive help with the implementation of RAM editing and sys-netcheat which was used as inspiration.\r\n  - [SciresM](https://github.com/SciresM) for the aarch64 hardware accelerated SHA256 code, his implementation of the Atmosph\xc3\xa8re cheat engine and his support during development.\r\n  - **kardch** for the beautiful current icon.\r\n  - **bernv3** for the beautiful old icon.\r\n  - **All config creators** for bringing this project to life!\r\n\r\n  <br>\r\n\r\n  - [nlohmann](https://github.com/nlohmann) for his great json library.\r\n  - [Martin J.
