b'# Strap\nA script to bootstrap a minimal macOS development system. This does not assume you\'re doing Ruby/Rails/web development but installs the minimal set of software every macOS developer will want.\n\n## Motivation\nReplacing [Boxen](https://github.com/boxen/boxen/) in [GitHub](https://github.com/) with a better tool. This post outlines the problems with Boxen and requirements for Strap and other tools used by GitHub: https://mikemcquaid.com/2016/06/15/replacing-boxen/\n\n## Features\n- Disables Java in Safari (for better security)\n- Enables the macOS screensaver password immediately (for better security)\n- Enables the macOS application firewall (for better security)\n- Adds a `Found this computer?` message to the login screen (for machine recovery)\n- Enables full-disk encryption and saves the FileVault Recovery Key to the Desktop (for better security)\n- Installs the Xcode Command Line Tools (for compilers and Unix tools)\n- Agree to the Xcode license (for using compilers without prompts)\n- Installs [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) (for installing command-line software)\n- Installs [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) (for `bundler`-like `Brewfile` support)\n- Installs [Homebrew Services](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services) (for managing Homebrew-installed services)\n- Installs [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) (for installing graphical software)\n- Installs the latest macOS software updates (for better security)\n- Installs dotfiles from a user\'s `https://github.com/username/dotfiles` repository and runs `script/setup` to configure them; also runs `script/strap-after-setup` after setting up everything else\n- Installs software from a user\'s `Brewfile` in their `https://github.com/username/homebrew-brewfile` repository or `.Brewfile` in their home directory.\n- A simple web application to set Git\'s name, email and GitHub token (needs authorized on any organisations you wish to access)\n- Idempotent\n\n## Out of Scope Features\n- Enabling any network services by default (instead enable them when needed)\n- Installing Homebrew formulae by default for everyone in an organisation (install them with `Brewfile`s in project repositories instead of mandating formulae for the whole organisation)\n- Opting-out of any macOS updates (Apple\'s security updates and macOS updates are there for a reason)\n- Disabling security features (these are a minimal set of best practises)\n- Add phone number to security screen message (want to avoid prompting users for information on installation)\n\n## Usage\nOpen https://macos-strap.herokuapp.com/ in your web browser.\n\nInstead, to run Strap locally run:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap\ncd strap\nbash bin/strap.sh # or bash bin/strap.sh --debug for more debugging output\n```\n\nInstead, to run the web application locally run:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap\ncd strap\nGITHUB_KEY="..." GITHUB_SECRET="..." ./script/server\n```\n\nInstead, to deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) click:\n\n[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\n\n## Web Application Configuration Environment Variables\n- `GITHUB_KEY`: the GitHub.com Application Client ID.\n- `GITHUB_SECRET`: the GitHub.com Application Client Secret.\n- `SESSION_SECRET`: the secret used for cookie session storage.\n- `WEB_CONCURRENCY`: the number of Unicorn (web server) processes to run (defaults to 3).\n- `STRAP_ISSUES_URL`: the URL where users should file issues (defaults to no URL).\n- `STRAP_BEFORE_INSTALL`: instructions displayed in the web application for users to follow before installing Strap (wrapped in `<li>` tags).\n- `CUSTOM_HOMEBREW_TAP`: an optional Homebrew tap to install with `brew tap`. Specify multiple arguments to brew tap by separating values with spaces.\n- `CUSTOM_BREW_COMMAND`: a single `brew` command that is run after all other stages have completed.\n\n## Status\nStable and in active development.\n\n## Contact\n[Mike McQuaid](mailto:mike@mikemcquaid.com)\n\n## License\nLicensed under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).\nThe full license text is available in [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).\n'
