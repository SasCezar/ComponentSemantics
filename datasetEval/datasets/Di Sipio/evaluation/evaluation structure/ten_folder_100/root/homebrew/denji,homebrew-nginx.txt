b'# NGINX Homebrew Tap\n\nThis tap is designed specifically for a custom build of NGINX with more module options.\n\n## How do I install these formule (NGINX Modules)?\nOnce the tap is installed, you can install `nginx-full`\nwith optional [additional modules](https://denji.github.io/homebrew-nginx/#modules):\n\n    brew tap denji/nginx\n    brew install nginx-full --with-upload-module\n\nFor a list of available configuration options run:\n\n    brew options nginx-full\n    brew info nginx-full\n\n## What about conflicts?\nYou are free to install this version alongside a current install of NGINX from `Homebrew/homebrew` if you wish. However, they cannot be linked at the same time. To switch between them use brew\'s built in linking system.\n\n    brew unlink nginx\n    brew link nginx-full\n\n## Documentation\n`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew\'s documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/README.md).\n\n## Contributing\nPlease see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/denji/homebrew-nginx/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## How to submit a new formula\n* Fork this repository on GitHub.\n* Clone to your Mac.\n* Read and look at the other formule here.\n* In your locally cloned `homebrew-nginx` repo, create a new branch: `git checkout --branch my_new_formula`\n* Write/edit your formula (ruby file).
