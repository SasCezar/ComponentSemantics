b"nxdk - *the new open source xdk*\n================================\nnxdk is a software development kit for the original Xbox. nxdk is a revitalization of [OpenXDK](https://web.archive.org/web/20170624051336/http://openxdk.sourceforge.net:80/).\n\nNotable features:\n- No complicated cross-compiling or big library dependencies! Builds with `make` and just needs standard tools and llvm.\n- 3D graphics! nxdk includes and expands on pbkit, a library for interfacing with the Xbox GPU.\n\nStatus\n------\nnxdk is currently in early stages of development.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n### Prerequisites\nYou will need the following tools:\n- GNU make\n- [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/)\n- [GNU bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) and [flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net/)\n- [lld](http://lld.llvm.org/)\n- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)\n- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)\n\nOS-specific instructions for installing these prerequisites can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk/wiki/Install-the-Prerequisites)\n\n### Download nxdk\n    git clone https://github.com/xqemu/nxdk.git\n    cd nxdk\n    git submodule init\n    git submodule update --recursive\n\n### Build Samples\nSamples are easily built by running the Makefile in one of the sample directories. Details can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk/wiki/Build-a-Sample). nxdk also supports automatic [creation of ISO files](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk/wiki/Create-an-XISO).\n\nNext Steps\n----------\nCopy one of the sample directories to get started. You can copy it anywhere you\nlike, but make sure that the `NXDK_DIR` variable in the Makefile points to\ncorrect place. Then, in the directory, you can simply run `make`.\n\nCredits\n-------\n- [OpenXDK](https://web.archive.org/web/20170624051336/http://openxdk.sourceforge.net:80/) is the inspiration for nxdk, and large parts of it have been reused.

Hacked together parts of an old Linux OHCI stack.\n* `lib/winapi` - Xbox specific implementations of common useful WinAPI-functions.\n* `lib/xboxkrnl` - Header and import library for interfacing with the Xbox kernel.\n* `lib/xboxrt` - Miscellaneous functionality for debugging etc.\n* `lib/xlibc-rt` - Implementations of supportive functions required at runtime.\n* `tools/cxbe` - Simple converter for PE executables to the Xbox executable format, from OpenXDK.\n* `tools/fp20compiler` - Translates register combiner descriptions to Xbox pushbuffer commands.\n* `tools/vp20compiler` - Translates vertex program assembly to Xbox microcode.\n* `tools/extract-xiso` - Generates and extracts ISO images compatible with the Xbox (and XQEMU).\n* `samples/` - Sample applications to get started.\n"
