b'# homebrew-cask-drivers\nCasks of drivers\n\n# Usage\n\nAfter you install Homebrew, run the following command:\n\n```sh\n$ brew tap homebrew/cask-drivers\n```\n\nYou can now install the casks in this repo.\n\n```sh\n$ brew cask install xbox360-controller-driver-unofficial\n```\n\n## On macOS version compatibility\n\nDrivers have strict requirements regarding which versions of an operating system they can run on. If you wish to expand the OS support for a driver cask, *you need to provide a link to the upstream page that verifies said support*. This is to say that \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve tried it on my machine and it worked\xe2\x80\x9d is not sufficient reasoning. For all we know, the software may break on the next point release, or it may just be your specific configuration that allows it to run even though your OS version is not officially supported.\n\nIf you believe the upstream requirements are incorrect, please contact *them* and get them to correct the information on their page, at which point the cask requirements can also be updated.\n\n## License\n[The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)\n'
