As the console os doesn\'t implement custom themes natively most of this is done by patching system SZS files to get the desidered aspect.\\\n\\\nUnfortunately SZS files from the switch os contain copyrighted data so to make theme sharing legal the **nxtheme format** has been developed, it\'s 100% legal and works on every firmware >= 5.0, unless you\'re dealing with making your own patches and custom layouts you should only use nxtheme files.\n\n# Usage\nOpen the injector and go to the NXThemes builder tab, open any 720p image (1280x720 pixels) and fill the form, then click on build nxtheme.\\\nTo install nxthemes files on your console download the NxThemes installer homebrew from the releases then just select any nxtheme file from your sd.\\\nThis app works on windows, you can use the CLI through mono on linux using the package `mono-complete`. \\\nNote that on linux you must use DDS files as the built-in image converter works only on windows.\n\n## Command line args\nYou can automate theme creation using command line args.\n### Building nxthemes\nThe syntax is:\n```\nSwitchThemes.exe buildNX home "<your image.png/jpg/dds>" "<json layout file, optional>" "name=<theme name>" "author=<author name>" "out=<OutputPath>.nxtheme"\n```\nthis will build a theme for the home menu, instead of `home` you can use: `lock` for lockscreen, `apps` for the all apps screen, `set` for the settings applet, `user` for the user page applet and `news` for the news applet. Only the image and out file args are needed. \\\nOther options specific to the theme target such as applet icons are availbale as well, run `SwitchThemes.exe help` for more info\n### Patching SZS files\n```\nSwitchThemes.exe szs "<input file>" "<your image.png/jpg/dds>" "<json layout file, optional>" "album=<custom album icon.png/dds>" "out=<OutputPath>.szs"\n```\n`album` will only be used if patching a residentMenu szs.\n### Remote install\nUsing the remote install feature in the NXThemesInstaller homebrew\n```\nSwitchThemes.exe install 192.168.X.Y "<nxtheme/szs file>"\n```\n\n# Useful resources\nCheck out how to make your own layouts and animations [here](https://github.com/exelix11/SwitchThemeInjector/blob/master/CustomLayouts.md) \\\nYou can also find more info about the szs patching process [here](https://github.com/exelix11/SwitchThemeInjector/blob/master/SzsPatching.md)\n'
