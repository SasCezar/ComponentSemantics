b'# Redis.app\n\n### The easiest way to get started with Redis on the Mac\n\n*Just download, drag to the applications folder, and double-click.*\n\n![Screenshot](https://jpadilla.github.io/redisapp/assets/img/screenshot.png)\n\n### [Download](http://jpadilla.github.io/redisapp)\n\n--\n\n### Version numbers\n\nVersion numbers of this project (Redis.app) try to communicate the version of the included Redis binaries bundled with each release.\n\nThe version number also includes a build number which is used to indicate the current version of Redis.app and it\'s independent from the bundled Redis\'s version.\n\n### Adding Redis binaries to your path\n\nIf you need to add the Redis binaries to your path you can do so by adding the following to your `~/.bash_profile`.\n\n```bash\n# Add Redis.app binaries to path\nPATH="/Applications/Redis.app/Contents/Resources/Vendor/redis/bin:$PATH"\n```\n\nOr using the `path_helper` alternative:\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &&\necho /Applications/Redis.app/Contents/Resources/Vendor/redis/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/redisapp\n```\n\n### Installing with Homebrew Cask\n\nYou can also install Redis.app with [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/).\n\n```bash\n$ brew cask install redis-app\n```\n\n### Credits\n\nForked and adapted from [Mongodb.app](https://github.com/gcollazo/mongodbapp).
