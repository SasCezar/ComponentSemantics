b"# dotfiles\n\nGabriel Berke-Williams' dotfiles for Zsh, ruby, git, and more.\n\nThey assume you're using OSX.\n\nQuestions? Comments?

However, non-configuration files and folders like `system/`,\n`Brewfile`, `README.md`, etc will not be linked because they are in the\n`EXCLUDES` section of the [`rcrc`](/rcrc) file.\n\n## Tags\n\n`rcm` has the concept of tags: items under `tag-git/` are in the `git` tag, and\nso on. I'm using it for organization, so that if someone starts using Haskell I\ncan point them at all of my Haskell configuration across Vim/Zsh/GHCi, all in\none place.\n\n## Zsh\n\nAll of the Zsh configuration is in [`zshrc`](/zshrc).\n\n## Attribution\n\nMany scripts and configurations have been inspired by or outright stolen from\nmy colleagues at thoughtbot. Of special note, I've stolen many things from\n[Chris Toomey], [Gordon Fontenot], and [Teo Ljungberg], among others that I'm\nsure I'm forgetting.\n\n[Chris Toomey]: https://github.com/christoomey/dotfiles\n[Gordon Fontenot]: https://github.com/gfontenot/dotfiles\n[Teo Ljungberg]: https://github.com/teoljungberg/dotfiles\n"
