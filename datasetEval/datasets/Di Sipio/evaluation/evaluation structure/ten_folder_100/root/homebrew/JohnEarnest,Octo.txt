b'Octo\n====\n\n![Title Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/gh-pages/images/f8z.gif)\n\n[Octo](http://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/) is a high-level assembler for the [Chip8](http://mattmik.com/chip8.html) virtual machine, complete with an environment for testing programs, and tools for sharing your creations.

By default, Octo stores programs in its own backend, indexed based on a `key`.\n\nUsing the "Save HTML" button in the "Binary Tools" panel of the toolbox, you can generate a single HTML file containing the Octo emulator and your program, allowing you to easily host a game yourself or on sites like [Itch.io](https://internet-janitor.itch.io/an-evening-to-die-for). Octo can be configured to offer adaptive multitouch controls, making your games playable on mobile devices and tablets!\n\n![Screenshot of HTML export dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/gh-pages/images/html-export-screenshot.png)\n\nOcto can also save "Cartridges" which embed programs and their metadata in an animated GIF. Cartridges are easy to share via email or image hosting sites, and include the source code of your programs, so others can riff on your creations:\n\n![Cartridge Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/gh-pages/images/murdercart.gif)\n\nFinally, [Doct](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/tree/gh-pages/tools/Doct) is an experimental tool for building standalone binaries which run Octo programs. Give it a whirl!\n\nLicensing\n---------\nOcto, along with all its associated documentation, examples and tooling, are made available under the MIT license. See LICENSE.txt for additional details.
