b"# Plutonium - an easy-to-use UI framework for Nintendo Switch homebrew\n\n## What is Plutonium?\n\nPlutonium is a high-level, C++ graphical library with the aim of making UIs in a more user-firendly way.\n\nIt uses libnx and SDL2, so both libraries are required.\n\nTo be more exact, this libraries should be installed via pacman:\n\n```sh\npacman -S switch-sdl2 switch-sdl2_ttf switch-sdl2_image switch-sdl2_gfx switch-sdl2_mixer switch-mesa switch-glad switch-glm switch-libdrm_nouveau switch-libwebp switch-libpng switch-freetype switch-bzip2 switch-libjpeg-turbo switch-opusfile switch-libopus\n```\n\n## Internal structure and performance\n\nPlutonium uses SDL2 for UI rendering.\n\nPlutonium's performance is based on WPF's system. The user doesn't directly interact with the rendering, as it's done via a main rendering system and different objects to render.\n\nSame way WPF does, you can create an UI by making a custom Application class inheriting from `pu::Application` class, or simply creating a variable and adding elements to it.\n\nThe main function to initialize the application is `Show()`.\n\nCheck the [examples](Examples) for a basic usage of the libraries. In case you want to see a really powerful app which really shows what Plutonium is capable of, take a look at [Goldleaf](https://github.com/XorTroll/Goldleaf).\n\nCheck the [documentation](https://XorTroll.github.io/Plutonium/) for a more detailed explanation of the library's usage.\n\n## Using this libraries\n\nOn the [releases](https://github.com/XorTroll/Plutonium/releases) page you have all the released versions. All of them are zipped files, containing `include` and `lib` directories.\n\n### Simple project layout\n\nThis is how a regular Plutonium project would (more or less) have its Makefile and project layout using Plutonium:\n\n- Makefile\n\n```Makefile\n...\n\nLIBS := -lpu -lfreetype -lSDL2_mixer -lopusfile -lopus -lmodplug -lmpg123 -lvorbisidec -logg -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_gfx -lSDL2_image -lSDL2 -lEGL -lGLESv2 -lglapi -ldrm_nouveau -lwebp -lpng -ljpeg `sdl2-config --libs` `freetype-config --libs` -lnx\nLIBDIRS := $(PORTLIBS) $(LIBNX) $(CURDIR)/Plutonium\n\n...\n```\n\n- Project directory\n\n```txt\nProject\n |\n |-- Makefile\n |-- source\n |-- include\n |-- Plutonium\n      |\n      |-- include\n      |-- lib\n```\n\n## Building\n\nClone the repository, cd into `Plutonium` directory and run `make`.\n\nYou will need devkitPro, libnx and all the libraries mentioned above installed via pacman.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you would like to be more informed about my projects' status and support, you should check [H&H](https://discord.gg/3KpFyaH), my Discord server.
