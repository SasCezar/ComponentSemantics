I\'m gonna send my game to Nintendo and get cartridge of my game and I\'l-\n\nStop right there kiddo, this is for Homebrew only.\n\nThis is not for releasing a real 3DS title. I dunno, contact Nintendo if that\'s what you want.\n\n#### Can I use this to run Mari0?\nNo.\n\n# Showcase\n * [Picroxx!](https://gbatemp.net/threads/picroxx-the-ultimate-picross-clone.412055) by Substance12\n * [Space Shooter Game](http://novaember.com/s/8f9453/FIrGGQ.mp4) by Darkwater\n * [Ludum Dare 33 Entry](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=31436) by me\n * [NumberFucker3DS](https://github.com/VideahGams/NumberFucker3DS) by unek & me\n * [SpaceFruit](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-space-fruit.399088/) by TurtleP\n * [Loophole](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-loophole-3ds-port.399585/) by Aaron Butterworth & CKlidify\n * [Hax0r](https://gbatemp.net/threads/preview-hax0r.401707) by TurtleP\n * [Idiot](https://gbatemp.net/threads/preview-idiot-a-puzzle-platformer.408774) by TurtleP\n * [ravimid](https://hoksy.itch.io/ravimid) by hoksy "raisin bran" jp\n * [Jetski 3DS](https://github.com/miltoncandelero/JETSKI-3DS/releases/tag/Potato-Version) by miltoncandelero\n \nSend me your projects so I can showcase them here!\n\n# Dependencies\nThe following dependencies are required to be installed properly in your dev environment for LovePotion to build.\n * [3ds_portlibs](https://github.com/cpp3ds/3ds_portlibs)\n * [citro3d](https://github.com/fincs/citro3d)\n * [sf2dlib](https://github.com/xerpi/sf2dlib)\n * [sftdlib](https://github.com/xerpi/sftdlib)\n * [sfillib](https://github.com/xerpi/sfillib)\n\n# Credits\n\n * Smealum and everyone who worked on [ctrulib](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib) and ~~[Ninjhax](http://smealum.net/ninjhax)~~ all the Hax!\n * xerpi for [sf2dlib](https://github.com/xerpi/sf2dlib) and [sftdlib](https://github.com/xerpi/sftdlib) and [sfillib](https://githubcom/xerpi/sfillib)\n * Everyone who worked on [lua-compat-5.2](https://github.com/keplerproject/lua-compat-5.2)\n * Everyone who has worked on [Citra](http://citra-emu.org/)\n * Everyone who worked on [DevKitARM](http://devkitpro.org/)\n * rxi for [lovedos](https://github.com/rxi/lovedos) which has been good learning material (I also used his luaobj util)\n * Firew0lf, Reuh, Negi and everyone else who worked on [ctruLua](https://github.com/Firew0lf/ctruLua)\n * TurtleP for help/advice and being my best customer\n * Mik Embley for his contributions\n * All of the L\xc3\x96VE community, for being awesome\n * Anyone that I forgot\n \n\n# License\n\nThis code is licensed under the MIT Open Source License.\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2016 Ruairidh Carmichael - ruairidhcarmichael@live.co.uk\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
