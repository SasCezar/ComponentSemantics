b'# Homebrew-autoupdate\n\nAn easy, convenient way to automatically update Homebrew.\n\nThis script will run `brew update` in the background once every 24 hours by default.\n\n`brew upgrade` and `brew cleanup` can also be handled automatically but\nare optional flags. If you have `terminal-notifier` installed you can\nalso request desktop notifications when this command runs.\n\n[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/update.png)](https://xkcd.com/1328/)\n\n## Installing this command\n\nJust `brew tap domt4/autoupdate`.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nbrew autoupdate --start [interval] [--upgrade] [--cleanup] [--enable-notification]:\n  Start autoupdating either once every interval hours or once every 24 hours.\n  Please note the interval has to be passed in seconds, so 12 hours would be:\n    brew autoupdate --start 43200.\n\n  If --upgrade is specified, autoupdate will also upgrade your installed\n  formulae. If the Caskroom exists locally Casks will be upgraded as well.\n\n  If --cleanup is specified, autoupdate will also automatically clean\n  brew\'s cache and logs.\n\n  If --enable-notification is specified, autoupdate will send a notification\n  when the autoupdate process has finished successfully, if terminal-notifier\n  is installed & found.\n\n autoupdate --stop:\n  Stop autoupdating, but retain plist & logs.\n\n autoupdate --delete:\n  Cancel the autoupdate, delete the plist and logs.\n\n autoupdate --status:\n  Prints the current status of this tool.\n\n autoupdate --version:\n  Output this tool\'s current version.\n```\n\n## This Vs brew\'s built-in autoupdate mechanism\n\nThis command mostly exists to ensure Homebrew is updated regardless of whether\nyou invoke `brew` or not, which is the primary difference from the autoupdate\nmechanism built into `brew`, the latter requiring a user to explicitly run\nany of `brew install`, `brew tap` or `brew upgrade`.\n\nIf you run `brew` commands regularly yourself, you may wish to consider using\nthe built-in autoupdate mechanism, which can be instructed to autoupdate less\noften or disabled entirely. If you wish to update every 24 hours using the\nbuilt-in autoupdate mechanism set this in your environment:\n\n```bash\nexport HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS="86400"\n```\n\nor if you wish to disable the built-in autoupdate mechanism entirely:\n\n```bash\nexport HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE="1"\n```\n\nPlease note that Homebrew themselves slightly frown upon people disabling\nthe built-in autoupdate mechanism.\n\n## License\n\nCode is under the [BSD 2 Clause (NetBSD) license](https://github.com/DomT4/homebrew-autoupdate/blob/master/LICENSE).\n'
