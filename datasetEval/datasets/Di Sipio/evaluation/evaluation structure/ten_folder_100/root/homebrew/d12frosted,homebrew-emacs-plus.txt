b'* Emacs Plus\n#+BEGIN_HTML\n<img src="https://travis-ci.org/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus.svg?branch=master">\n#+END_HTML\n\nEmacs Plus is GNU Emacs formulae based on =emacs= [[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/emacs.rb][formulae]]. The difference is\nthat some of the options available from =emacs= formulae are enabled by default\nin =emacs-plus= and some new [[#options][additional options]] are available for user.\n\n** Upgrade from Emacs 25.x\nWith release of Emacs 26.1 many options were removed from the formula, as\nfeatures behind them are already in released version.\n\nBut most of the users might suffer due to removal of =--natural-title-bar=\noption. In order to duplicate its behaviour add following lines to your\n=init.el= file.\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp\n  (add-to-list \'default-frame-alist\n               \'(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))\n\n  (add-to-list \'default-frame-alist\n               \'(ns-appearance . light)) ;; or dark - depending on your theme\n#+END_SRC\n\nIn case for some reason you still want to use old Emacs 25 formula, it is\navailable as =emacs-plus@25=.\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC bash\n  $ brew install emacs-plus@25 [all-your-favourite-options]\n#+END_SRC\n\n** Install\n#+BEGIN_SRC bash\n  $ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus\n  $ brew install emacs-plus [options]\n#+END_SRC\n\nBy default (without any addition options) this formula install Cocoa version of\nEmacs with support of =gnutls=, =imagemagick=, =librsvg=, =libxml2=, dynamic\nmodules and multicolor fonts and Spacemacs icon. Please see the list of\navailable options to disable any bit of default behaviour or add even more\nstuff.\n\nIn order to install without Spacemacs icon you should use following command.\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC bash\n  $ brew install emacs-plus --without-spacemacs-icon\n#+END_SRC\n\n*** macOS Mojave users\n\nIf you are using macOS Mojave, please note that most of the experimental options\nare forbidden on Mojave. This is temporary decision.\n\n** Options\nTo get list of all available options, call ~brew info emacs-plus~. Here is\nrelevant part from output of that command for your convenience.\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC bash\n  ==> Options\n  --with-ctags\n    Don\'t remove the ctags executable that Emacs provides\n  --with-dbus\n    Build with dbus support\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-EmacsIcon1\n    Using Emacs icon project EmacsIcon1\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-EmacsIcon2\n    Using Emacs icon project EmacsIcon2\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-EmacsIcon3\n    Using Emacs icon project EmacsIcon3\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-EmacsIcon4\n    Using Emacs icon project EmacsIcon4\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-EmacsIcon5\n    Using Emacs icon project EmacsIcon5\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-EmacsIcon6\n    Using Emacs icon project EmacsIcon6\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-EmacsIcon7\n    Using Emacs icon project EmacsIcon7\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-EmacsIcon8\n    Using Emacs icon project EmacsIcon8\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-EmacsIcon9\n    Using Emacs icon project EmacsIcon9\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-emacs-card-blue-deep\n    Using Emacs icon project emacs-card-blue-deep\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-emacs-card-british-racing-green\n    Using Emacs icon project emacs-card-british-racing-green\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-emacs-card-carmine\n    Using Emacs icon project emacs-card-carmine\n  --with-emacs-icons-project-emacs-card-green\n    Using Emacs icon project emacs-card-green\n  --with-mailutils\n    Build with mailutils support\n  --with-modern-icon\n    Using a modern style Emacs icon by @tpanum\n  --with-no-frame-refocus\n    Disables frame re-focus (ie. closing one frame does not refocus another one)\n  --with-no-titlebar\n    Experimental: build without titlebar\n  --with-pdumper\n    Experimental: build from pdumper branch and with increased remembered_data size (--HEAD only)\n  --with-x11\n    Experimental: build with x11 support\n  --with-xwidgets\n    Build with xwidgets\n  --with-jansson\n    Build with jansson support (--HEAD only)\n  --without-cocoa\n    Build a non-Cocoa version of Emacs\n  --without-gnutls\n    Build without gnutls support\n  --without-imagemagick@6\n    Build without imagemagick@6 support\n  --without-imagemagick@7\n    Build without imagemagick@7 support (--HEAD only)\n  --without-librsvg\n    Build without librsvg support\n  --without-libxml2\n    Build without libxml2 support\n  --without-little-cms2\n    Build without little-cms2 support\n  --without-modules\n    Build without dynamic modules support\n  --without-multicolor-fonts\n    Build without a patch that enables multicolor font support\n  --without-spacemacs-icon\n    Build without Spacemacs icon by Nasser Alshammari\n  --devel\n    Install development version 26.1-rc1\n  --HEAD\n    Install HEAD version\n#+END_SRC\n\nNote that by default =emacs-plus= builds the Cocoa version of Emacs with\n=gnutls=, =imagemagick=, =librsvg= and dynamic modules support by default. Also\nit changes default GNU Emacs icon to Spacemacs icon. If you wish to change\ndefaults, just use =--without-FEATURE= flag.\n\nNote that =--HEAD= builds are not really supported. They may fail to install,\nthey may crash at run time. Or even worse, they may work as expected. So use this\noption at your own risk. And feel free to open up issues you face, just remember\nthat I am not close enough to Emacs development process to provide you much help\nwith any arising issues.\n\n*** No Titlebar\nThis patch is enabled with the =--with-no-titlebar= option. It is meant for use with\nwindow tiling applications like chunkwm or amethyst so that the titlebar you will\nnever need to click on won\'t take up screen real estate. If you see gaps between your\nemacs frames and other windows, try this:\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp\n  (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t)\n#+END_SRC\n\n*** Portable dumper\nThe portable dumper is a feature that may be available with Emacs 27.1, but for\nnow the code is in the =dumper= branch of the Emacs Git repository.\n\nIn order to use that branch, please use =--with-pdumper --HEAD= options.\n\nPlease, take a look at it\'s usage in [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/EXPERIMENTAL.org#spacemacs-dumps-using-the-portable-dumper][Spacemacs]].\n\n*** Xwidgets (webkit)\nThe original [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsXWidgets][Emacs xwidgets]] builds and works on macOS however must be used with\nx11 and hence not practical option on macOS. This version enables xwidgets on\nnative macOS X Cocoa via embedding a native webkit window.\n\nMore details can be seen here [[https://github.com/veshboo/emacs][Veshboo\'s emacs branch]].\n\n** Emacs configuration\nEmacs is a journey.

But here are several\nyou should be aware of.\n\n*** =emacs= dependency in other formulas\nIn some cases (like when installing =cask=) regular =emacs= package will be\nrequired. In such cases you might want to install all dependencies manually\n(except for =emacs=) and then install desired package with\n=--ignore-dependencies= option.\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC bash\n$ brew install cask --ignore-dependencies\n#+END_SRC\n\n** Screenshots\n#+BEGIN_HTML\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/b6r8m3runia01fz/screen1.png?raw=1">\n  <p>by @j-martin</p>\n</p>\n#+END_HTML\n\n** Acknowledgements\nMany thanks to all [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/graphs/contributors][contributors]], issue reporters and bottle providers ([[https://github.com/wadkar][Sudarshan\nWadkar]], [[https://github.com/jonhermansen][Jon Hermansen]]).\n'
