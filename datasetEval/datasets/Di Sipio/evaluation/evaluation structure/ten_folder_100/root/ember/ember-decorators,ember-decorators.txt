b'Ember Decorators\n==============================================================================\n\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-decorators.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-decorators)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ember-decorators/ember-decorators.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ember-decorators/ember-decorators)\n\nEmber Decorators began as a project dedicated to exploring and unlocking the \nfuture of native classes in Ember.js. Now, that future is here! Decorators will\nbe landing soon in Ember, and there is a [polyfill available for \nthem](https://github.com/pzuraq/ember-decorators-polyfill).\n\nThis library now contains a few extra decorators which were not upstreamed to \nEmber, and may still be useful to some users. Check out the [documentation \nwebsite](https://ember-decorators.github.io/ember-decorators) for detailed API \ndocumentation for all the decorators included in this addon.\n\nUsage\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst install the main `ember-decorators` addon.\n\n```sh\nember install ember-decorators\n```\n\nThis addon doesn\'t contain any decorators itself, but includes the core set of\nsubaddons that are necessary to begin writing Ember using native classes:\n\n* `@ember-decorators/component`\n* `@ember-decorators/object`\n\nSee the [API Documentation](https://ember-decorators.github.io/ember-decorators)\nfor detailed examples and documentation of the individual decorators.\n\nDevelopment\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Specs\n\nEmber follows the [legacy decorators "stage 1" proposal API](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy#why-legacy). \nThe decorators proposal is currently being redesigned for stage 3, and the\nchampions have [publicly stated that this is the recommended path forward](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators#how-should-i-use-decorators-in-transpilers-today).\n\n### Organization\n\nThis repository consists of multiple packages managed with [lerna.js](https://lernajs.io/).\nThe decorators all reside in their own individual packages under `/packages`,\nalong with the main `ember-decorators` package.\n\nThe main package serves three purposes:\n\n1. A quick way to install all of the subpackages and get new projects up and\n  running. Installing the main package also adds any necessary babel transforms,\n  and sets up ESLint properly.\n2. A place for common functionality, such as the native class blueprints that\n  overwrite the default Ember blueprints.\n3. A place for the documentation site and tests for all of the other addons.\n  Tests were consolidated from the other addons in order to speed up the testing\n  and development process.\n\n### Setting up\n\n* Fork the repository\n* `git clone <your-fork-url>`\n* `cd ember-decorators`\n* `npm install`\n\n### Linting\n\n* `npm run lint:js`\n* `npm run lint:js -- --fix`\n\n### Running tests\n\n* `npm test` \xe2\x80\x93 Runs the test suite on the current Ember version\n\n### Running the dummy application\n\n* `npm start`\n* Visit the dummy application at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).\n\nLicense\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).\n'
