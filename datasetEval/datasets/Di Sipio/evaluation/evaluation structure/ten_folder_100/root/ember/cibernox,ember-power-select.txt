Any deprecation will be considered a bug.\n\nAs any other ember-cli addon, run:\n\n```\nember install ember-power-select\n```\n\nEmber Power Select 2.X requires Ember **2.10.0+**.\nEmber Power Select 3.X requires Ember **3.11.0+**.\n\n## Features overview\n\nEmber Power Select wants to be as agnostic as possible about how you're going to use it, but it still provides\nsome default implementations that will match 95% of your needs, and exposes actions to customize the other\n5% of usages.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n* Single select\n* Multiple select\n* HTML inside the options or the trigger.\n* Filter options sanitizing diacritics.\n* Custom matchers.\n* Asynchonous searches.\n* Theming\n* Fully promise-aware, with loading states.\n* Compatible with ember-concurrency task cancellation.\n* Compatibility with ember-data's ArrayProxies\n* Groups (with not deep limit), placeholders...\n* Clear the selection\n* Disable the component or individual options\n* CSS animations and transitions\n* ... and anything else you want. Just replace parts of the selects with your own components.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nCheck the full documentation with live examples at [www.ember-power-select.com](http://www.ember-power-select.com) and\nplease open an issue if something doesn't work or is not clear enough.\n\nGood docs are important :)\n\n## Extensions\n\nEmber-power-select's focus on flexibility enables the community to build richer and more tailor made\ncomponents on top of it, focused in solving one particular problem, using composition.\n\nCheck the [addons](http://www.ember-power-select.com/addons) section to see some and if you create\none that you want to open source open a PR to include it in the list.\n\n## Browser support\n\nThis component was just tested it in modern browsers but there is no technical reason it\nwouldn't work in IE9+. If you find any problem please file an issue.\n\n## Testing\n\nIn testing it requires phantomjs 2.0+. This component also provides some convenient [test helpers](http://www.ember-power-select.com/docs/test-helpers)\nto interact with the component in acceptance tests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny contribution is welcome. Please read our [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\nHowever, if your contribution involves adding a new feature, please open an issue before to\nshare your plan and agree the details of the feature before starting implementing it.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf something doesn't work visit the [Troubleshooting](http://www.ember-power-select.com/docs/troubleshooting)\nsection of the docs first and if your problem persist open an issue, specify the version of the component,\nEmber and browser.\n\n"
