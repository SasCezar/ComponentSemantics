b"# Ember Wordpress\n\nEmber Wordpress is an addon for ember-cli that makes it easy to fetch data from the Wordpress API (WP-API) in your Ember sites. It includes an application adapter, serializer as well as some default models: post, page, category and tag.\n\n## Demonstration\n\n- [Demo website](https://ember-wordpress.surge.sh/)\n- [Source code for the demo](https://github.com/oskarrough/ember-wordpress/tree/master/tests/dummy/app)\n- [API for the demo](https://dev-ember-wordpress.pantheonsite.io/wp-json/wp/v2/)\n\n> Note, the demo API sometimes goes to _sleep_. Please open an issue if so.\n\nA few sites using ember-wordpress:\n\n- https://www.alivefestival.dk, http://pfadfinderei.com, http://magnus-winter.de, http://kunstjagd.com and yours?\n\n## How to install\n\n1. Run `ember install ember-wordpress`\n2. Define where your Wordpress installation is:\n\n```js\n// config/environment.js\n...\nENV.emberWordpress: {\n  host: 'https://my-wordpress-site.com'\n}\n```\n\nOn a version before 2.0.1? Use `ENV.wordpressHost` instead.\n\n## Models\n\nYou'll have seven models ready out of the box: `wordpress/post`, `wordpress/page`, `wordpress/category` `wordpress/tag`, `wordpress/attachment`,  `wordpress/comment`, `wordpress/user`.\n\nNote: the `wordpress/post` and `wordpress/page` models are identical and so are `wordpress/category` and `wordpress/tag`. For your own custom post types, it is recommended to extend the `post` model:\n\n```js\n// app/models/recipe.js\nimport DS from 'ember-data';\nimport PostModel from 'ember-wordpress/models/post';\nexport default PostModel.extend({\n  ingredients: DS.attr()\n});\n```\n\nIf you're using the ACF plugin your custom fields will be at `model.get('acf.myCustomField')`.\n\n## Configuring Wordpress\n\nSince Wordpress version 4.7 the REST API is included in core Wordpress. If you are on an earlier version you will need to install the [WP API v2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/) plugin, which also works fine.\n\nAfter installing, create some posts or pages in Wordpress and see your data at `example.com/wp-json/wp/v2`.\n\nIf you're having CORS trouble: [WP-CORS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cors/)\nIf you want custom fields: [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) and [ACF To REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-to-rest-api/)\n\n### Wordpress custom post types\n\nTo use a custom post type together with the WP API you have to be aware of two additional arguments, when you define them.\n\n1. `show_in_rest` must be set to true.\n2. `rest_base` will be the endpoint of your post type. Sset it to the plural form of your model, as this is what Ember expects. E.g. the endpoint for a `recipe` post type should be `recipies` and not `recipe`.\n\nHere's a full example. You could save this file as `wp-content/plugins/my-custom-post-types.php`.\n\n```php\n<?php\n/*\nPlugin Name: My custom post types\nAuthor URI: https://github.com/oskarrough/ember-wordpress/\n*/\nfunction artist_post_type() {\n\t$labels = array(\n\t\t'name' => 'Artists',\n\t\t'singular_name' => 'Artist',\n\t\t'menu_name' => 'Artists',\n\t);\n\t$args = array(\n\t\t'labels' => $labels,\n\t\t'show_in_rest'\t=> true,\n\t\t'rest_base' => 'artists',\n\t);\n\tregister_post_type('artist', $args);\n}\n\nadd_action('init', 'artist_post_type');\n?>\n```\n\n## Queries\n\nThe WP API supports many [arguments](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/posts/#arguments) that you can use but it's not super friendly so here are some tips.\n\n### How to query more than 10 items\n\nBy default the WP API returns a maximum of 10 items. For instance, `this.store.findAll('post')` would return 10 posts. To change that we need to find the right argument and endpoint. Looking at the documentation for WP API we find `per_page`. It could look like `wp-json/wp/v2/posts?per_page=99` which translates into the ember-data query `this.store.query('post', {per_page: 99})`.\n\n### How to query by slug\n\n- Endpoint:  `wp-json/wp/v2/posts?slug=some-post-slug`\n- Query: `this.store.query('post', {slug: 'some-post-plug'}).then(models => models.get('firstObject'));`\n\nWe take the first object because `query` always returns an array and we expect our query to only return a single object.\n\n### How to query by category\n\nTo query posts by category slug you will need two queries.\n \nFirst get the category id with the\n\n- Endpoint: `wp-json/wp/v2/categories?slug=some-category-slug`\n- Query: `this.store.query('category', {slug: 'some-category-slug'}).then(models => models.get('firstObject'));`\n\nThen, get the posts\n\n- Endpoint: `wp-json/wp/v2/posts?categories=category-id&per_page=99`\n- Query: `this.store.query('post', {per_page: 99, categories: category-id}).then(models => models.get('firstObject'));`\n\n### How to enable caching for the WP API\n\nEnable caching by installing the [wp-rest-api-cache](https://github.com/airesvsg/wp-rest-api-cache) wordpress plugin.\n\n## Server-side rendering with FastBoot\n\nTo get server-side rendering, install [Ember Fastboot](https://ember-fastboot.com/). Here's a [demo](https://ember-wordpress-nymqnnqwxp.now.sh/) of the Ember Wordpress dummy app served by fastboot. You'll see the actual HTML rendered if you view the source. Ember Wordpress doesn't require anything special to make this work. Here's a small [deployment tip](https://gist.github.com/oskarrough/42cef880cbfa874637e90c08102f18d0).\n\n### Eager loading\n\nBy default, Ember loads every request to a record separately from the server. If you want to display a post and the names of all of it's tags for example, Ember will query the main post and every single tag. A post with five tags will result in six requests to the server. \n\nSince Ember and WP-API supports loading of multiple resources of the same type in one request, you can opt-in to this feature:\n\n```\nvar ENV = {\n  ...\n  emberWordpress: {\n    coalesceFindRequests: true\n  }  \n  ...\n```\n\nWith this option enabled, loading a post with five tags will result in just two requests, because all tags of the post will be loaded together. This can improve the load time of your Ember app a lot!\n\n## Contributing\n\nIt's the goal of ember-wordpress to be the bridge between ember/ember-data and the official WP REST API. Ideally, in addition to the provided adapter, serializer and models, this readme and the project's demo app should serve as good examples.
