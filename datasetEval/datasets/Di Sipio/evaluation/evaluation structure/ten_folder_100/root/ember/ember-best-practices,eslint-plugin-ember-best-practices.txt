b'# Ember Best Practices\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ember-best-practices/eslint-plugin-ember-best-practices.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ember-best-practices/eslint-plugin-ember-best-practices)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/ember-best-practices/eslint-plugin-ember-best-practices/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/ember-best-practices/eslint-plugin-ember-best-practices?branch=master)\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/eslint-plugin-ember-best-practices.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/eslint-plugin-ember-best-practices)\n\nThis adds more guard rails for Ember. Just because something "works" does not mean it is correct or in line with the framework\'s programming model. These footguns include:\n\n- Not adhering to Data Down Actions Up\n- Side-effect programming\n- Usage of observers\n- Usage of attrs.*\n- Computed properties without dependent keys\n\n# Why\nAs we\'ve scaled out to over hundreds developers and thousands of lines of code it has become clear that more "development time" guidance is required. While the guides do a good job about getting started, it\'s good to have some friction to make sure the app code is aligned with how Ember works.\n\n## Using the plugin with Ember CLI\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall the plugin as a dev dependency in your Ember CLI project.\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-ember-best-practices\n```\n\nThis will make the plugin available to ESLint.\n\nNext, install the [ember-cli-eslint](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-eslint) addon so that your app can be linted during development and testing. This will also uninstall [ember-cli-jshint](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-jshint) since there is no need to have both linters running at the same time.\n\n```\nember install ember-cli-eslint\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe `ember-cli-eslint` addon blueprint generates a .eslintrc.js configuration file at the root of the project.\n\nAdd the plugin\'s [recommended](https://github.com/ember-best-practices/eslint-plugin-ember-best-practices/blob/master/config/recommended.js) configuration to the list of extensions:\n\n```\n// .eslintrc.js\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  extends: [\n    \'eslint:recommended\',\n    \'plugin:ember-best-practices/recommended\'\n  ],\n  rules: {\n  }\n};\n```\n'
