b'# Corber [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isleofcode/corber.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/isleofcode/corber)\n\nCorber is a CLI that improves the hybrid app build experience for Vue, Ember, Glimmer, and React apps using Cordova.\n\nCorber handles framework and app builds and validations with a single command: `corber build` - without affecting existing web flows. The CLI also includes on-device livereload for development and utility functions for icons, plugins, and more. And when needed, it can proxy to the Cordova CLI.\n\nIt is a continuation of the ember-cordova project. ember-cordova users can find details [here](http://blog.isleofcode.com/announcing-corber-ember-cordova-vue), and continue to access the existing [ember addon](https://github.com/isleofcode/ember-cordova) and [documentation](http://ember-cordova.com). For migration instructions, see [Migrating from Ember Cordova](http://corber.io/pages/ember-cordova-migration).\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n# Yarn\nyarn global add corber\n\n# NPM\nnpm install -g corber\n```\n\n## Initialize Corber\n1. Change to your project directory.\n2. Run `corber init`.\n3. Select iOS and press space to select the platform.\n\n## Configure Your Project for Corber\n### Vue CLI 3\n1. Open `vue.config.js`. (Create file in project root if it doesn\'t exist. See [Example Vue Config](http://corber.io/pages/frameworks/vue).)\n2. Require `corber-webpack-plugin` and assign it as `CorberWebpackPlugin`.\n3. Add `new CorberWebpackPlugin()` to the `configureWebpack.plugins` array.\n\nFor Vue CLI 2 or Non-Vue CLI, see [Configure Vue CLI 2 or Non-Vue CLI projects](http://corber.io/pages/frameworks/vue).\n\n### Ember\n1. Open `config/environment.js`.\n2. Set `locationType` to `hash`.\n3. Update `rootURL` or `baseURL` to remove its leading slash, if it has one.\n\n### Extending Frameworks\nCorber comes with built-in support for Vue, Ember, and React, but can be extended to work with the framework of your choice. See [Extending Corber to Support Other Frameworks](http://corber.io/pages/frameworks/extending).\n\n## Run App on an Emulator with Live Reload\n1. Run `corber start`.\n2. Select an emulator.\n\n## Build, Flash, and Run App on Your Device\n1. Run `corber build`. (Ignore error code 65 error, signing will be set in step 3.)\n2. Run `corber open` to open the Xcode project.\n3. *First Time Only*: In Xcode, select the Project Navigator, select your project, and under Signing, set your Team.\n4.
