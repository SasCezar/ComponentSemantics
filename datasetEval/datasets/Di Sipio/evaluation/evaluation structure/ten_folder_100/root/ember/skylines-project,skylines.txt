b"# SkyLines\n\n*SkyLines* is a web platform where pilots can share their flights with others\nafter, or even during flight via live tracking.  *SkyLines* is a sort of social\nnetwork for pilots including rankings, statistics and other interesting\nfeatures.  Most of all *SkyLines* is truly open in all regards compared to\nother similar platforms.\n\n*SkyLines* has started development in 2012 as a spin-off from the popular\n[XCSoar](http://www.xcsoar.org/) glide computer. Internally *SkyLines* is still\nsharing some code with XCSoar in the algorithmic areas and is providing the\nbase for XCSoar's live tracking functionalities.\n\n*SkyLines* is far from finished yet, but it has been running in production for\nquite some time now. You can reach the official server at\n<http://www.skylines.aero>.\n\nBuild Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skylines-project/skylines.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skylines-project/skylines)\n\n## Getting the source\n\nThe *SkyLines* source code is managed with [git](http://www.git-scm.com/).\nIt can be downloaded with the following command:\n\n    $ git clone git://github.com/skylines-project/skylines.git\n\nFor more information, please refer to the [git documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation).\n\n## Installation and Setup\n\n*SkyLines* is based on Python and depends on the following major components:\n\n* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database with\n  [PostGIS 2.x](http://www.postgis.net/) extension\n* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web application microframework for Python\n* [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) ORM framework with\n  [GeoAlchemy 2](https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.org) extension\n* [gevent](http://www.gevent.org/) coroutine-based network library for Python (used for\n  the live tracking server)\n\nThe process of installing these components and setting up a server for local\ndevelopment is described in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.\n\n## Contact and Contributing\n\nYou read about news on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/skylines.project) and\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/skylinesproject).
