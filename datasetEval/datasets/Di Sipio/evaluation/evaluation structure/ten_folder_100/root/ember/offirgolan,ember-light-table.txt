We\'re happy to help you there!\n\n## :metal: Getting Involved\n\nWe\'re glad you love *ember-light-table* just as much as we do! If you want to help us making it even better, we would be delighted to have you on board, even if you\'ve just started using Ember.\n\n### :bulb: Submitting Ideas\n\nIf you\'ve got a great idea in store, but don\'t feel up for the task to implement it yourself, just [**open an issue**][new-issue]. That way you can put your thoughts out there for discussion and we can evolve it further.\n\nWe\'ll see, whether this feature is a good fit for *ember-light-table* itself or could better be implemented in a third-party addon.\n\nYou\'re also always invited to chime in on ongoing issues, *especially* for issues marked with [**ideas-wanted**][ideas-wanted].\n\n### :keyboard: Contributing Code\n\nContributing to an Ember addon is a great opportunity to get in touch with advanced concepts. You\'re also getting free peer review for your code as a bonus!\n\nAnd most importantly, you\'re doing something good for the community!\n\n#### :sparkles: New Features\n\nIf you want to make a bigger change, we recommend [**opening an issue**][new-issue] first, so we can agree on the best possible implementation first and none of your work goes to waste.\n\n#### :eyes: Don\'t know where to start?\n\nYou don\'t have a specific feature in mind but want to help out anyways? Awesome!\n\nIssues marked with [**help wanted**][help-wanted] are generally agreed upon and ready to get implemented. Oftentimes we have clearly outlined how these issues should get resolved.\n\nWe try hard to accurately estimate the overall difficulty and scope of issues and organize them with labels:\n\n- :relaxed: [**difficulty-easy**][difficulty-easy]: Perfect for beginners or if you don\'t have much time on your hands.\n- :wink: [**difficulty-medium**][difficulty-medium]: A fair knowledge of *ember-light-table* and Ember.js / ember-cli is recommended. The higher level plan or expected API has been clearly outlined. The implementation details should be pretty easy to figure out.\n- :thinking: [**difficulty-hard**][difficulty-hard]: For the experienced. Implementation details are important to get right as to not wreak havoc or kill performance. Still the overall plan should be clearly outlined.\n- :scream: [**difficulty-epic**][difficulty-epic]: Up for a challenge, eh? Either this issue has a really broad scope, requires substantial refactoring and rewrites or we know what we want to achieve, but are not quite sure how.\n\n#### :handshake: Got Stuck?\n\nWe\'re here to help! It\'s a good idea to submit you\'re pull request (PR) right away. Just prefix the title with `[WIP]` (work in progress) so we know that you\'re not done yet.\n\nThis way, you can get feedback early on or ask others for help. Your commits are also automatically tested by Travis CI. :robot:\n\nPull requests marked with [**ideas-wanted**][pr-ideas-wanted] are stuck and we would like to hear your thought.\n\nIf a pull request is marked with [**help wanted**][pr-help-wanted] we just don\'t have the time and resources to work on it right now. You\'re invited to continue working on it instead!\n\n[new-issue]: https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table/issues/new\n\n[ideas-wanted]: https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aideas-wanted\n[help-wanted]: https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22\n\n[pr-ideas-wanted]: https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%ideas-wanted\n[pr-help-wanted]: https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp+wanted\n\n[difficulty-easy]: https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adifficulty-easy\n[difficulty-medium]: https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adifficulty-medium\n[difficulty-hard]: https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adifficulty-hard\n[difficulty-epic]: https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adifficulty-epic\n\n[demo]: https://offirgolan.github.io/ember-light-table/\n[cookbook]: https://offirgolan.github.io/ember-light-table/#/cookbook\n[docs]: https://offirgolan.github.io/ember-light-table/docs/\n\n[slack]: https://embercommunity.slack.com/messages/C615THVGF\n[slackin]: https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/\n'
