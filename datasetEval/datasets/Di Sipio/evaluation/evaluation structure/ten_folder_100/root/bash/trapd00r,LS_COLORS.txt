Most of them use the extended color map,\ndescribed in the ECMA-48 document; in other words, you\'ll need a terminal\nwith capabilities of displaying 256 colors.\n\nAs of this writing, around 300 different filetypes/extensions is supported.\nThat\'s indeed a lot of extensions, but there\'s a lot more! Your help is greatly\nappreciated.\n\nFork this project on github, add the extensions you are missing, and send a pull\nrequest.\n\nSome guidelines:\n\nFor files that usually ends up next to each other, like html, css and js,\ntry to pick colors that fits in nicely together. Filetypes with multiple\npossible extensions, like htm and html, should have the same color.\n\n# What does it look like?\nHere\'s a screenshot _(font and minor color shades, of course, depend on terminal and its configuration)_:\n\n![Screenshot1](http://orig07.deviantart.net/f59a/f/2016/087/a/e/ls_colors_1_by_trapd00r-d9wrdoa.png)\n\nAnd another one:\n\n![Screenshot2](http://orig02.deviantart.net/5c73/f/2016/087/4/8/ls_colors_2_by_trapd00r-d9wrdrq.png)\n\n  [0]: https://github.com/trapd00r/zsh-syntax-highlighting-filetypes\n  [1]: https://github.com/trapd00r/File-LsColor\n  [2]: https://github.com/trapd00r/File-LsColor/tree/master/bin\n  [3]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lscolors-git\n\n# Installation\nTo install and use this file, put something like this in your shell resource\nfile:\n```shell\neval $( dircolors -b $HOME/.dircolors )\n```\n\nA quick way to install would be the following set of commands (assuming bash):\n\n```shell\nwget https://raw.github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS/master/LS_COLORS -O $HOME/.dircolors\necho \'eval $(dircolors -b $HOME/.dircolors)\' >> $HOME/.bashrc\n. $HOME/.bashrc\n```\n\n## Arch Linux\nArch Linux users can install the [`lscolors-git`][3] package from the AUR for easy\nintegration with bash, csh, or zsh.\n\n## zsh integration with Zplugin\nThere\'s a Zsh plugin manager `Zplugin` that nicely works with this repository\n\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0`dircolors` will be ran **only once on each update**. So `dircolors` will not\nread the `LS_COLORS` definitions and perform the computation each time a new\nshell is started, but **instead** only once per `trapd00r/LS_COLORS` install\nand per update (with `zplugin update trapd00r/LS_COLORS`) and only then\ngenerating the script `c.zsh` containing the `dircolors` output and after this\njust sourcing it when the shell starts, thus making the shell to startup faster:\n\n```\nzplugin ice atclone"dircolors -b LS_COLORS > c.zsh" atpull\'%atclone\' pick"c.zsh"\nzplugin load trapd00r/LS_COLORS\n```\n\n## ZSH syntax highlighting\n[zsh-syntax-highlighting-filetypes][0] highlights file on the command-line in\nrealtime, using these colors.\n\n## fish shell\n```fish\neval ( dircolors --c-shell $HOME/.dircolors)\n```\n\nPlace it in `~/.config/fish/config.fish` or any `*.fish*` file inside `~/.config/fish/conf.d/` to be loaded.\n\n# Information for Developers\nThere\'s a [library][1] I\'ve written that lets you use various LS COLORS on\narbitrary files and directories. A simple implementation can be found [here][2].\n\nUsing this, you can do\n```shell\nfind $HOME -maxdepth 1  | ls_color\n\nmpc search artist Laleh | ls_color\n```\n\n... and so on.\n\n# Legal \n\xc2\xa9 Copyright 2014-2018 Magnus Woldrich.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\nWARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE.
