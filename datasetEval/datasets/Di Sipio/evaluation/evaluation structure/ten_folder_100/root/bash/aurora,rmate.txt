b'# rmate\n\n## Description\n\nTextMate 2 adds a nice feature, where it is possible to edit files on a remote server\nusing a helper script. The original helper script provided with TM2 is implemented in\nruby. Here is my attempt to replace this ruby script with a shell script, because in\nsome cases a ruby installation might just be too much overhead for just editing remote\nfiles.\n\nThis script can be used with some other editors (e.g. Sublime Text) via available plug-ins.\n\nThe shell script needs to be copied to the server, you want to remote edit files, on.\nAfter that, you should set-up your editor to communicate with rmate.\n\n### Quick install\n\n```bash\nsudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/rmate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aurora/rmate/master/rmate\nsudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/rmate\n```\n\nor with [bpkg](https://github.com/bpkg/bpkg)\n\n```bash\nbpkg install aurora/rmate\n```\n\n### Set-up editor\n\n#### TextMate 2\n\nOpen your TM2 preferences and enable "Allow rmate connections" setting in\nthe "Terminal" settings and adjust the setting "Access for" according to your needs:\n\n![TM2_terminal_preferences](https://macromates.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/terminal_preferences.png)\n\n##### Local clients\n\nIt\'s a good idea to allow access only for local clients. In this case you need to open\na SSH connection to the system you want to edit a file on and specify a remote tunnel in\naddition:\n```bash\nssh -R 52698:localhost:52698 user@example.com\n```\n\nOr put the following lines in your local `~/.ssh/config`:\n```ssh-conf\nHost example.com\n    RemoteForward 52698 127.0.0.1:52698\n```\n\nIf you are logged in on the remote system, you can now just execute\n```bash\nrmate test.txt\n```\n\n##### Remote clients\n\nOn some machines, where port forwarding is not possible, for example due to a missing ssh\ndaemon, you can allow access for "remote clients". Just ssh or telnet to the remote machine\nand execute:\n```bash\nrmate -H textmate-host test.txt\n```\n\n#### Sublime Text\n\nTo use rmate with Sublime Text, yoou need to install a plug-in, e.g.\n[rsub](https://github.com/henrikpersson/rsub)\nor [RemoteSubl](https://github.com/randy3k/RemoteSubl).\n\nYou can install plug-ins via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/).\n[Install Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation),\npress `Cmd + Shift + P` for Mac and `Ctrl + Shift + P` for Linux/Windows,\nselect `Package Control: Install Package`,\nand, finally, select `rsub` for rsub or `RemoteSubl` for RemoteSubl.\n\nAlso, you can install plug-ins manually.\n\n* Linux\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/henrikpersson/rsub ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/rsub\ngit clone https://github.com/randy3k/RemoteSubl ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/RemoteSubl\n```\n\n* Windows\n```batch\ngit clone https://github.com/henrikpersson/rsub %APPDATA%/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Packages/rsub\ngit clone https://github.com/randy3k/RemoteSubl %APPDATA%/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Packages/RemoteSubl\n```\n\n* OS X\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/henrikpersson/rsub ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Packages/rsub\ngit clone https://github.com/randy3k/RemoteSubl ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/Packages/RemoteSubl\n```\n\nThen do the same things as described in [Local clients](#local-clients) part of this document.\n\n### Example\n\nExample session: Editing html file located on an SGI o2: <https://github.com/aurora/rmate/wiki/Screens>\n\n## Requirements\n\nA bash with compiled support for `/dev/tcp` is required. This is not the case on some\nolder linux distributions, like Ubuntu 9.x.\n\n## Usage\n\nEdit specified file\n```console\n$ ./rmate [arguments] [--] file-path\n```\n\nRead text from stdin\n```console\n$ echo "hello TextMate" | ./rmate [arguments] -\n```\n\n### Arguments\n\n    -H, --host HOST  Connect to HOST. Use \'auto\' to detect the host from SSH.\n    -p, --port PORT  Port number to use for connection.\n    -w, --[no-]wait  Wait for file to be closed by TextMate.\n    -l, --line LINE  Place caret on line number after loading file.\n    +N               Alias for --line, if N is a number (eg.: +5).\n    -m, --name NAME  The display name shown in TextMate.\n    -t, --type TYPE  Treat file as having specified type.\n    -n, --new        Open in a new window (Sublime Text).\n    -f, --force      Open even if file is not writable.\n    -v, --verbose    Verbose logging messages.\n    -h, --help       Display this usage information.\n        --version    Show version and exit.\n\n\n### Default parameter configuration\n\nSome default parameters (`host` and `port`) can be configured by defining them\nas the environment variables `RMATE_HOST` and `RMATE_PORT` or by putting them\nin a configuration file. The configuration files loaded are `/etc/rmate.rc`\nand `~/.rmate.rc`, e.g.:\n```ini\nhost: auto  # prefer host from SSH_CONNECTION over localhost\nport: 52698\n```\n\nAlternative notation for configuration file is:\n```ini\nhost=auto\nport=52698\n```\n\nThe precedence for setting the configuration is (higher precedence counts):\n\n1. default (`localhost`, `52698`)\n2. `/etc/rmate.rc`\n3. `~/.rmate/rmate.rc`\n4. `~/.rmate.rc`\n5. environment variables (`RMATE\\_HOST`, `RMATE\\_PORT`)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nUse with caution.
