b'# bash-powerline\n\nPowerline for Bash in pure Bash script.\n\n![bash-powerline](https://raw.github.com/riobard/bash-powerline/master/screenshots/solarized-light.png)\n\n## Features\n\n* Git: show branch name, tag name, or unique short hash.\n* Git: show "*" symbol with uncommited modifications.\n* Git: show "\xe2\x86\x91" symbol and number of commits ahead of remote.\n* Git: show "\xe2\x86\x93" symbol and number of commits behind remote.\n* Platform-dependent prompt symbols.\n* Color-coded prompt symbol according to previous command execution status.\n* Use Bash builtin when possible to reduce delay. Delay sucks!\n* No need for patched fonts.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nDownload the Bash script\n\n    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riobard/bash-powerline/master/bash-powerline.sh > ~/.bash-powerline.sh\n\nAnd source it in your `.bashrc`\n\n    source ~/.bash-powerline.sh\n\nFor best result, use [Solarized\ncolorscheme](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) for your terminal\nemulator. Or hack your own colorscheme by modifying the script. It\'s really\neasy.\n\n\n## Why?\n\nThis script is inspired by\n[powerline-shell](https://github.com/milkbikis/powerline-shell), which is\nimplemented in Python. Python scripts are much easier to write and maintain than\nBash scripts, but invoking Python interpreter introduces noticable delay to\ndraw. I hate delays, so I ported just the part I need to pure Bash script.\n\nThe other reason is that I don\'t like the idea of patching fonts. The\nfont patching mechanism from the original Powerline does not work with the\nbitmap font (Apple Monaco without anti-aliasing) I use on non-retina screens.\nI\'d rather stick with existing unicode symbols.\n\n\n## See also\n\n* [zsh-powerline](https://github.com/riobard/zsh-powerline): Same thing but for\n    Zsh.\n* [powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline): Unified Powerline\n  written in Python.
