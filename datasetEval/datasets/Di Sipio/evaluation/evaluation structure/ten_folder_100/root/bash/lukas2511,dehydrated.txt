b"# dehydrated [![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=23P9DSJBTY7C8)\n\n![](docs/logo.jpg)\n\nDehydrated is a client for signing certificates with an ACME-server (e.g. Let's Encrypt) implemented as a relatively simple (zsh-compatible) bash-script.\nThis client supports both ACME v1 and the new ACME v2 including support for wildcard certificates!\n\nIt uses the `openssl` utility for everything related to actually handling keys and certificates, so you need to have that installed.\n\nOther dependencies are: cURL, sed, grep, awk, mktemp (all found pre-installed on almost any system, cURL being the only exception).\n\nCurrent features:\n- Signing of a list of domains (including wildcard domains!)\n- Signing of a custom CSR (either standalone or completely automated using hooks!)\n- Renewal if a certificate is about to expire or defined set of domains changed\n- Certificate revocation\n\nPlease keep in mind that this software, the ACME-protocol and all supported CA servers out there are relatively young and there might be a few issues. Feel free to report any issues you find with this script or contribute by submitting a pull request,\nbut please check for duplicates first (feel free to comment on those to get things rolling).\n\n## Getting started\n\nFor getting started I recommend taking a look at [docs/domains_txt.md](docs/domains_txt.md), [docs/wellknown.md](docs/wellknown.md) and the [Usage](#usage) section on this page (you'll probably only need the `-c` option).\n\nGenerally you want to set up your WELLKNOWN path first, and then fill in domains.txt.\n\n**Please note that you should use the staging URL when experimenting with this script to not hit Let's Encrypt's rate limits.** See [docs/staging.md](docs/staging.md).\n\nIf you have any problems take a look at our [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) guide.\n\n## Config\n\ndehydrated is looking for a config file in a few different places, it will use the first one it can find in this order:\n\n- `/etc/dehydrated/config`\n- `/usr/local/etc/dehydrated/config`\n- The current working directory of your shell\n- The directory from which dehydrated was run\n\nHave a look at [docs/examples/config](docs/examples/config) to get started, copy it to e.g. `/etc/dehydrated/config`\nand edit it to fit your needs.\n\n## Usage:\n\n```text\nUsage: ./dehydrated [-h] [command [argument]] [parameter [argument]] [parameter [argument]] ...\n\nDefault command: help\n\nCommands:\n --version (-v)                   Print version information\n --register                       Register account key\n --account                        Update account contact information\n --cron (-c)                      Sign/renew non-existent/changed/expiring certificates.\n --signcsr (-s) path/to/csr.pem   Sign a given CSR, output CRT on stdout (advanced usage)\n --revoke (-r) path/to/cert.pem   Revoke specified certificate\n --cleanup (-gc)                  Move unused certificate files to archive directory\n --help (-h)                      Show help text\n --env (-e)                       Output configuration variables for use in other scripts\n\nParameters:\n --accept-terms                   Accept CAs terms of service\n --full-chain (-fc)               Print full chain when using --signcsr\n --ipv4 (-4)                      Resolve names to IPv4 addresses only\n --ipv6 (-6)                      Resolve names to IPv6 addresses only\n --domain (-d) domain.tld         Use specified domain name(s) instead of domains.txt entry (one certificate!)\n --alias certalias                Use specified name for certificate directory (and per-certificate config) instead of the primary domain (only used if --domain is specified)\n --keep-going (-g)                Keep going after encountering an error while creating/renewing multiple certificates in cron mode\n --force (-x)                     Force renew of certificate even if it is longer valid than value in RENEW_DAYS\n --no-lock (-n)                   Don't use lockfile (potentially dangerous!)\n --lock-suffix example.com        Suffix lockfile name with a string (useful for with -d)\n --ocsp                           Sets option in CSR indicating OCSP stapling to be mandatory\n --privkey (-p) path/to/key.pem   Use specified private key instead of account key (useful for revocation)\n --config (-f) path/to/config     Use specified config file\n --hook (-k) path/to/hook.sh      Use specified script for hooks\n --out (-o) certs/directory       Output certificates into the specified directory\n --alpn alpn-certs/directory      Output alpn verification certificates into the specified directory\n --challenge (-t) http-01|dns-01  Which challenge should be used? Currently http-01 and dns-01 are supported\n --algo (-a) rsa|prime256v1|secp384r1 Which public key algorithm should be used? Supported: rsa, prime256v1 and secp384r1\n```\n\n## Donate\n\nI'm a student hacker with a few (unfortunately) quite expensive hobbies (self-hosting, virtualization clusters, routing,\nhigh-speed networking, embedded hardware, etc.).\nI'm really having fun playing around with hard- and software and I'm steadily learning new things.\nWithout those hobbies I probably would never have started working on dehydrated to begin with :)\n\nI'd really appreciate if you could [donate a bit of money](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=23P9DSJBTY7C8)\nso I can buy cool stuff (while still being able to afford food :D).  \n\nIf you have hardware laying around that you think I'd enjoy playing with (e.g. decommissioned but still modern-ish servers,\n10G networking hardware, enterprise grade routers or APs, interesting ARM/MIPS boards, etc.) and that you would be willing\nto ship to me please contact me at `donations@dehydrated.io` or on Twitter [@lukas2511](https://twitter.com/lukas2511).\n\nIf you want your name to be added to the [donations list](https://dehydrated.io/donations.html) please add a note or send me an\nemail `donations@dehydrated.io`. I respect your privacy and won't publish your name without permission.\n\nOther ways of donating:\n - [My Amazon Wishlist](http://www.amazon.de/registry/wishlist/1TUCFJK35IO4Q)\n - Monero: 4Kkf4tF4r9DakxLj37HDXLJgmpVfQoFhT7JLDvXwtUZZMTbsK9spsAPXivWPAFcDUj6jHhY8hJSHX8Cb8ndMhKeQHPSkBZZiK89Fx8NTHk\n - Bitcoin: 12487bHxcrREffTGwUDnoxF1uYxCA7ztKK\n"
