b'# shpotify\n\n*shpotify* is a simple Bash/Apple script to control\n [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) from the command line on a Mac.\n\nIf you find this interesting, you should [follow me on\nTwitter](https://twitter.com/copingbear) to learn about the other\nthings I do.\n\n## Installation\n\n[Download and install](http://www.spotify.com/download) the Spotify\ndesktop application if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t already.\n\n### With Homebrew\n\nThe easiest way to install shpotify is by using the [Homebrew package\nmanager](http://brew.sh):\n\n````\nbrew install shpotify\n````\n\n### Manual installation\n\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t use Homebrew, you can install the script manually by\nfollowing a few simple steps:\n\n1. Fetch a copy of this repository, either with git or [download the\n   zip archive](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify/archive/master.zip).\n\n2. Navigate to the folder where you fetched the repository (unzip if\n   needed) and make sure the file called `spotify` is executable:\n   ````\n   cd shpotify\n   chmod +x spotify\n   ````\n\n3. Copy the file `spotify` to a convenient location in your `PATH`, or\n   set your `PATH` to include the folder where the file is located.\n\n### Connecting to Spotify\xe2\x80\x99s API\n\nshpotify needs to connect to Spotify\xe2\x80\x99s API in order to find music by\nname. It is very likely you want this feature!\n\nTo get this to work, you first need to sign up (or into) Spotify\xe2\x80\x99s\ndeveloper site and [create an *Application*][spotify-dev]. Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve\ndone so, you can find its `Client ID` and `Client Secret` values and\nenter them into your shpotify config file at `${HOME}/.shpotify.cfg`.\n\nBe sure to quote your values and don\xe2\x80\x99t add any extra spaces. When\ndone, it should look like the following (but with your own values):\n\n````\nCLIENT_ID="abc01de2fghijk345lmnop"\nCLIENT_SECRET="qr6stu789vwxyz"\n````\n\n## Usage\n\nWith shpotify you can control Spotify with the following commands:\n````\nspotify play                       Resumes playback where Spotify last left off.\nspotify play <song name>           Finds a song by name and plays it.\nspotify play album <album name>    Finds an album by name and plays it.\nspotify play artist <artist name>  Finds an artist by name and plays it.\nspotify play list <playlist name>  Finds a playlist by name and plays it.\nspotify play uri <uri>             Play songs from specific uri.\n\nspotify next                       Skips to the next song in a playlist.\nspotify prev                       Returns to the previous song in a playlist.\nspotify replay                     Replays the current track from the beginning.\nspotify pos <time>                 Jump to a specific time (in seconds) in the current song.\nspotify pause                      Pauses (or resumes) Spotify playback.\nspotify stop                       Stops playback.\nspotify quit                       Stops playback and quits Spotify.\n\nspotify vol up                     Increases the volume by 10%.\nspotify vol down                   Decreases the volume by 10%.\nspotify vol <amount>               Sets the volume to an amount between 0 and 100.\nspotify vol [show]                 Shows the current volume.\n\nspotify status                     Shows the play status, including the current song details.\nspotify status artist              Shows the currently playing artist.\nspotify status album               Shows the currently playing album.\nspotify status track               Shows the currently playing track.\n\nspotify share                      Displays the current song\'s Spotify URL and URI.\nspotify share url                  Displays the current song\'s Spotify URL and copies it to the clipboard.\nspotify share uri                  Displays the current song\'s Spotify URI and copies it to the clipboard.\n\nspotify toggle shuffle             Toggles shuffle playback mode.\nspotify toggle repeat              Toggles repeat playback mode.\n````\n\n## Authors and contributing\n\nshpotify is primarily written and maintained by [Harish\nNarayanan](https://harishnarayanan.org).\n\nSince it\xe2\x80\x99s an open source project, it contains numerous contributions\nfrom many helpful people, including:\n\n* Jorge Colindres\n* Thomas Pritchard\n* iLan Epstein\n* Gabriele Bonetti\n* Sean Heller\n* Eric Martin\n* Peter Fonseca\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in contributing too, please consider addressing\nsome of the [issues people have previously\nreported](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify/issues) and\n[submitting a pull\nrequest](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). **Thank\nyou!**\n\n## Copyright and license\n\nCopyright (c) 2012\xe2\x80\x932019 [Harish Narayanan](https://harishnarayanan.org).\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
