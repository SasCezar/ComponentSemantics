b"![Nexus Tools logo](https://i.imgur.com/2l38Zqb.png)\n================\n\nNexus Tools is a simple installer for the [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) package, which includes [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html), Fastboot, [Systrace](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/systrace-commandline.html), and other applications.\n\nInstalling these tools requires downloading the proper files, extracting them somewhere, and [adding the files' folder to your system's path](https://askubuntu.com/a/60221). Nexus Tools does all that hard work for you, and installs additional configuration files to fix common USB problems.\n\n### Features\n\n* Works on Linux, Bash for Windows 10\xc2\xb9, Linux on Chromebooks\xc2\xb2, and Mac. An x86 processor is required on all platforms.\n* The SDK Platform Tools package is downloaded from Google's servers, so you're always getting the latest version.\n* All files are stored in `~/.nexustools`, so sudo access is not required.\n* A [USB Vendor ID list](https://apkudo.com/one-true-adb_usb-ini-to-rule-them-all/) and [UDEV rules file](https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/blob/master/51-android.rules) are installed to fix common USB connection issues (UDEV file only applies to Linux and is optional).\n* Can be easily removed.\n\n\xc2\xb9*Windows Subsystem for Linux doesn't support USB connections. However, it is possible to [use ADB over a Wi-Fi connection](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.wifiadb).*\n\n\xc2\xb2*Chrome OS 75 or newer is required for [USB support](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/06/26/chrome-os-75/).*\n\n### How to install\n\nNexus Tools does not need to be downloaded, just paste this command into the terminal:\n```\nbash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/nexus-tools/master/install.sh)\n```\nTo uninstall, run this command:\n```\nbash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/nexus-tools/master/uninstall.sh)\n```\n\nOnce Nexus Tools is finished, you can run `adb`, `fastboot`, and other commands straight from the terminal. **You may need to open a new terminal window for changes to take effect.** To update, just run the installer again.\n\n[XDA thread for Nexus Tools](http://forum.xda-developers.com/general/general/tool-nexus-tools-2-8-featured-xda-t3258661)\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
