Be a good hacker and contribute your wisdom to the hive mind by [tweaking existing snippets and adding your own](https://github.com/ok-borg/borg/tree/master/docs).\n\n### Install\n\nThe following releases only let you search snippets. To add or edit snippets, install from source. Releases are coming soon.\n\n```\nbrew install borg\n```\n\nFor Linux, download [a release](https://github.com/ok-borg/borg/releases) manually:\n\n```\nwget https://github.com/ok-borg/borg/releases/download/v0.0.3/borg_linux_amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/borg\nchmod 755 /usr/local/bin/borg\n```\n\nSame for Mac:\n\n```\nwget https://github.com/ok-borg/borg/releases/download/v0.0.3/borg_darwin_amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/borg\nchmod 755 /usr/local/bin/borg\n```\n\n### Rate results: `worked`\n\nWhen a result works for you, use the `worked` command to give feedback:\n\n```\nborg worked 12\n```\n\nThis will rank the result higher for similar queries\xe2\x80\x94especially helpful when a good result was buried in the search results.\n\n### Advanced usage\n\nFor more commands and their explanations, please see [advanced usage](https://github.com/ok-borg/borg/tree/master/docs).\n\n### How does borg work?\n\nThe client connects to a server at [ok-b.org](https://ok-b.org/). You can host your own server too (see daemon folder), though self-hosting will become less appealing once people start contributing their own content to the database.\n\n### UI explanation\n\n- `()` denotes hits for your query\n- `[]` denotes snippets found for a given query\n- `...` under a `[]` means more lines to display (use the `-f` flag for full display, see more about usage below)\n\n### Credits\n\nThe borg mascot has been delivered to you by the amazing [Fabricio Rosa Marques](https://dribbble.com/fabric8).\n\n### Community\n\n- Use the [dockerized borg client](https://github.com/juhofriman/borg-docker) if you don\'t want to install anything on your host!\n'
