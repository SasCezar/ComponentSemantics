Write and evaluate mathematical equations involving multidimensional arrays easily. If this sounds like [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), it\'s because the idea is quite similar. Specifically, the library is pretty low-level, like Theano, but has higher goals like Tensorflow.\n\nGorgonia:\n\n* Can perform automatic differentiation\n* Can perform symbolic differentiation\n* Can perform gradient descent optimizations\n* Can perform numerical stabilization\n* Provides a number of convenience functions to help create neural networks\n* Is fairly quick (comparable to Theano and Tensorflow\'s speed)\n* Supports CUDA/GPGPU computation (OpenCL not yet supported, send a pull request)\n* Will support distributed computing\n\n# Why Use Gorgonia? #\n\nThe main reason to use Gorgonia is developer comfort. If you\'re using a Go stack extensively, now you have access to the ability to create production-ready machine learning systems in an environment that you are already familiar and comfortable with. \n\nML/AI at large is usually split into two stages: the experimental stage where one builds various models, test and retest; and the deployed state where a model after being tested and played with, is deployed. This necessitate different roles like data scientist and data engineer.\n\nTypically the two phases have different tools: Python ([PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), etc) is commonly used for the experimental stage, and then the model is rewritten in some more performant language like C++ (using [dlib](http://dlib.net/ml.html), [mlpack](http://mlpack.org) etc). Of course, nowadays the gap is closing and people frequently share the tools between them. Tensorflow is one such tool that bridges the gap.\n\nGorgonia aims to do the same, but for the Go environment. Gorgonia is currently fairly performant - its speeds are comparable to PyTorch\'s and Tensorflow\'s  CPU implementations. GPU implementations are a bit finnicky to compare due to the heavy cgo tax, but rest assured that this is an area of active improvement.\n\n# Installation #\n\nThe package is go-gettable: `go get -u gorgonia.org/gorgonia`.\n\nGorgonia is compatible with go modules :\n\n[embedmd]:# (go.mod)\n```go\nmodule example.com/gorgonia_test\n\ngo 1.12\n\nrequire gorgonia.org/gorgonia v0.9.3\n```\n\nThe current stable version is 0.9.3\n\n\n## Versioning ## \n\nWe use [semver 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) for our versioning. Before 1.0, Gorgonia\'s APIs are expected to change quite a bit. API is defined by the exported functions, variables and methods. For the developers\' sanity, there are minor differences to semver that we will apply prior to version 1.0. They are enumerated below:\n\n* The MINOR number will be incremented every time there is a deletrious break in API. This means any deletion, or any change in function signature or interface methods will lead to a change in MINOR number. \n* Additive changes will NOT change the MINOR version number prior to version 1.0. This means that if new functionality were added that does not break the way you use Gorgonia, there will not be an increment in the MINOR version. There will be an increment in the PATCH version.  \n\n## Go Version Support ##\n\nGorgonia supports 2 versions below the Master branch of Go. This means Gorgonia will support the current released version of Go, and up to 4 previous versions - providing something doesn\'t break. Where possible a shim will be provided (for things like new `sort` APIs or `math/bits` which came out in Go 1.9).\n\nThe current version of Go is 1.13.1. The earliest version Gorgonia supports is Go 1.11.x but Gonum supports only 1.12+. Therefore, the minimum Go version to run the master branch is Go > 1.12.\n\n## Hardware and OS supported ##\n\nGorgonia runs on :\n- linux/AMD64\n- linux/ARM7\n- linux/ARM64\n- win32/AMD64\n- darwin/AMD64\n- freeBSD/AMD64\n\nIf you have tested gorgonia on other platform, please update this list.\n\n## Hardware accelaration\n\nGorgonia use some pure assembler instructions to accelerate somes mathematical operations. Unfortunately, only amd64 is supported.\n\n\n## Dependencies ##\n\nThere are very few dependencies that Gorgonia uses - and they\'re all pretty stable, so as of now there isn\'t a need for vendoring tools. These are the list of external packages that Gorgonia calls, ranked in order of reliance that this package has (subpackages are omitted):\n\n|Package|Used For|Vitality|Notes|Licence|\n|-------|--------|--------|-----|-------|\n|[gonum/graph](https://github.com/gonum/gonum/tree/master/graph)| Sorting `*ExprGraph`| Vital.

Official updates and announcements will be posted to those two sites.\n\n# Usage #\n\nGorgonia works by creating a computation graph, and then executing it. Think of it as a programming language, but is limited to mathematical functions, and has no branching capability (no if/then or loops). In fact this is the dominant paradigm that the user should be used to thinking about. The computation graph is an [AST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). \n\nMicrosoft\'s [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK), with its BrainScript, is perhaps the best at exemplifying the idea that building of a computation graph and running of the computation graphs are different things, and that the user should be in different modes of thoughts when going about them. \n\nWhilst Gorgonia\'s implementation doesn\'t enforce the separation of thought as far as CNTK\'s BrainScript does, the syntax does help a little bit.\n\nHere\'s an example - say you want to define a math expression `z = x + y`. Here\'s how you\'d do it:\n\n[embedmd]:# (example_basic_test.go)\n```go\npackage gorgonia_test\n\nimport (\n\t"fmt"\n\t"log"\n\n\t. "gorgonia.org/gorgonia"\n)\n\n// Basic example of representing mathematical equations as graphs.\n//\n// In this example, we want to represent the following equation\n//\t\tz = x + y\nfunc Example_basic() {\n\tg := NewGraph()\n\n\tvar x, y, z *Node\n\tvar err error\n\n\t// define the expression\n\tx = NewScalar(g, Float64, WithName("x"))\n\ty = NewScalar(g, Float64, WithName("y"))\n\tif z, err = Add(x, y); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\t// create a VM to run the program on\n\tmachine := NewTapeMachine(g)\n\tdefer machine.Close()\n\n\t// set initial values then run\n\tLet(x, 2.0)\n\tLet(y, 2.5)\n\tif err = machine.RunAll(); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Printf("%v", z.Value())\n\t// Output: 4.5\n}\n```\n\nYou might note that it\'s a little more verbose than other packages of similar nature. For example, instead of compiling to a callable function, Gorgonia specifically compiles into a `*program` which requires a `*TapeMachine` to run. It also requires manual a `Let(...)` call.\n\nThe author would like to contend that this is a Good Thing - to shift one\'s thinking to a machine-based thinking. It helps a lot in figuring out where things might go wrong.\n\nAdditionally, there are no support for branching - that is to say there are no conditionals (if/else) or loops. The aim is not to build a Turing-complete computer. \n\n### VMs ###\n\nThere are two VMs in the current version of Gorgonia:\n\n* `TapeMachine`\n* `LispMachine`\n\nThey function differently and take different inputs. The `TapeMachine` is useful for executing expressions that are generally static (that is to say the computation graph does not change). Due to its static nature, the `TapeMachine` is good for running expressions that are compiled-once-run-many-times (such as linear regression, SVM and the like).\n\nThe `LispMachine` on the other hand was designed to take a graph as an input, and executes directly on the nodes of the graph. If the graph change, simply create a new lightweight `LispMachine` to execute it on. The `LispMachine` is suitable for tasks such as creating recurrent neural networks without a fixed size.\n\nPrior to release of Gorgonia, there was a third VM - a stack based VM that is similar to `TapeMachine` but deals with artificial gradients better. It may see light of day again, once this author has managed to fix all the kinks.\n\n## Differentiation ##\n\nGorgonia performs both symbolic and automatic differentiation. There are subtle differences between the two processes. The author has found that it\'s best to think of it this way - Automatic differentiation is differentiation that happens at runtime, concurrently with the execution of the graph, while symbolic differentiation is differentiation that happens during the compilation phase. \n\nRuntime of course, refers to the execution of the expression graph, not the program\'s actual runtime.\n\nWith the introduction to the two VMs, it\'s easy to see how Gorgonia can perform both symbolic and automatic differentiation. Using the same example as above, the reader should note that there was no differentiation done. Instead, let\'s try with a `LispMachine`:\n\n[embedmd]:# (example_autodiff_test.go)\n```go\npackage gorgonia_test\n\nimport (\n\t"fmt"\n\t"log"\n\n\t. "gorgonia.org/gorgonia"\n)\n\n// Autodiff showcases automatic differentiation\nfunc Example_autodiff() {\n\tg := NewGraph()\n\n\tvar x, y, z *Node\n\tvar err error\n\n\t// define the expression\n\tx = NewScalar(g, Float64, WithName("x"))\n\ty = NewScalar(g, Float64, WithName("y"))\n\tif z, err = Add(x, y); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\t// set initial values then run\n\tLet(x, 2.0)\n\tLet(y, 2.5)\n\n\t// by default, LispMachine performs forward mode and backwards mode execution\n\tm := NewLispMachine(g)\n\tdefer m.Close()\n\tif err = m.RunAll(); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Printf("z: %v\\n", z.Value())\n\n\tif xgrad, err := x.Grad(); err == nil {\n\t\tfmt.Printf("dz/dx: %v\\n", xgrad)\n\t}\n\n\tif ygrad, err := y.Grad(); err == nil {\n\t\tfmt.Printf("dz/dy: %v\\n", ygrad)\n\t}\n\n\t// Output:\n\t// z: 4.5\n\t// dz/dx: 1\n\t// dz/dy: 1\n}\n```\n\nOf course, Gorgonia also supports the more traditional symbolic differentiation like in Theano:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t"fmt"\n\t"log"\n\n\t. "gorgonia.org/gorgonia"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tg := NewGraph()\n\n\tvar x, y, z *Node\n\tvar err error\n\n\t// define the expression\n\tx = NewScalar(g, Float64, WithName("x"))\n\ty = NewScalar(g, Float64, WithName("y"))\n\tz, err = Add(x, y)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\t// symbolically differentiate z with regards to x and y\n\t// this adds the gradient nodes to the graph g\n\tvar grads Nodes\n\tgrads, err = Grad(z, x, y)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\t// create a VM to run the program on\n\tmachine := NewTapeMachine(g)\n\n\t// set initial values then run\n\tLet(x, 2.0)\n\tLet(y, 2.5)\n\tif machine.RunAll() != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Printf("z: %v\\n", z.Value())\n\n\txgrad, err := x.Grad()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tfmt.Printf("dz/dx: %v | %v\\n", xgrad, grads[0])\n\n\tygrad, err := y.Grad()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tfmt.Printf("dz/dy: %v | %v\\n", ygrad, grads[1])\n\n\t// Output:\n\t// z: 4.5\n\t// dz/dx: 1 | 1 :: float64{1}\n\t// dz/dy: 1 | 1 :: float64{1}\n}\n```\n\nCurrently Gorgonia only performs backwards mode automatic differentiation (aka backpropagation), although one may observe the vestiges of an older version which supported forwards mode differentiation in the existence of `*dualValue`. It may return in the future.\n\n## Graph ##\n\nA lot has been said about a computation graph or an expression graph. But what is it exactly? Think of it as an AST for the math expression that you want. Here\'s the graph for the examples (but with a vector and a scalar addition instead) above:\n\n![graph1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorgonia/gorgonia/master/media/exprGraph_example1.png)\n\nBy the way, Gorgonia comes with nice-ish graph printing abilities. Here\'s an example of a graph of the equation `y = x\xc2\xb2` and its derivation:\n\n![graph1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorgonia/gorgonia/master/media/exprGraph_example2.png)\n\nTo read the graph is easy. The expression builds from bottom up, while the derivations build from top down. This way the derivative of each node is roughly on the same level. \n\nRed-outlined nodes indicate that it\'s a root node. Green outlined nodes indicate that they\'re a leaf node. Nodes with a yellow background indicate that it\'s an input node. The dotted arrows indicate which node is the gradient node for the pointed-to node.\n\nConcretely, it says that `c42011e840` (`dy/dx`) is the gradient node of the input `c42011e000` (which is `x`).\n\n### Node Rendering ###\n\nA Node is rendered thusly:\n\n<table>\n<tr><td>ID</td><td>node name :: type</td></tr>\n<tr><td>OP*</td><td>op name :: type</td></tr>\n<tr><td colspan="2">shape</td></tr>\n<tr><td colspan="2">compilation metadata</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Value\xe2\x80\xa0</td><td>Gradient</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Additional Notes ###\n\n* If it\'s an input node, then the Op row will not show up.\n* If there are no Values bound to the node, it will show up as NIL. However, when there are values and gradients, it will try to as best as possible display the values bound to the node.\n\n\n## Using CUDA ##\n\nGorgonia comes with CUDA support out of the box. However, usage is specialized. To use CUDA, you must build your application with the build tag `cuda`, like so:\n\n``` \ngo build -tags=\'cuda\' .\n```\n\nFurthermore, there are some additional requirements:\n\n1. [CUDA toolkit 9.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) is required. Installing this installs the `nvcc` compiler which is required to run your code with CUDA.\n2. Be sure to follow the [post-installation steps](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#post-installation-actions)\n3. `go install gorgonia.org/gorgonia/cmd/cudagen`. This installs the `cudagen` program. \n4. Running `cudagen` will generate the relevant CUDA related code for Gorgonia. Note that you will need a folder at `src\\gorgonia.org\\gorgonia\\cuda modules\\target`\n4. Only certain ops are supported by the CUDA driver by now. They are implemented in a seperate [`ops/nn` package](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorgonia/gorgonia/ops/nn). \n5. `runtime.LockOSThread()` must be called in the main function where the VM is running. CUDA requires thread affinity, and therefore the OS thread must be locked.\n\nBecause `nvcc` only plays well with `gcc` version 6 and below (the current version is 7), this is also quite helpful: `sudo ln -s /path/to/gcc-6 /usr/local/cuda-9.0/bin/gcc` \n### Example ###\n\nSo how do we use CUDA? Say we\'ve got a file, `main.go`:\n\n[embedmd]:# (ops/nn/conv_test.go /import/ /^}$/)\n```go\nimport (\n\t"fmt"\n\t"log"\n\t"runtime"\n\n\t"gorgonia.org/gorgonia"\n\tnnops "gorgonia.org/gorgonia/ops/nn"\n\t"gorgonia.org/tensor"\n)\n\nfunc ExampleConv2d() {\n\tg := gorgonia.NewGraph()\n\tx := gorgonia.NodeFromAny(g, tensor.New(\n\t\ttensor.WithShape(1, 1, 7, 5),\n\t\ttensor.WithBacking([]float32{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34})))\n\tfilter := gorgonia.NodeFromAny(g, tensor.New(\n\t\ttensor.WithShape(1, 1, 3, 3),\n\t\ttensor.WithBacking([]float32{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1})))\n\ty := gorgonia.Must(nnops.Conv2d(x, filter, []int{3, 3}, []int{0, 0}, []int{2, 2}, []int{1, 1}))\n\tm := gorgonia.NewTapeMachine(g)\n\truntime.LockOSThread()\n\tfor i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {\n\t\tif err := m.RunAll(); err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Fatalf("iteration: %d. Err: %v", i, err)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\truntime.UnlockOSThread()\n\n\tfmt.Printf("%1.1f", y.Value())\n\t// output:\n\t// \xe2\x8e\xa1 54.0   72.0\xe2\x8e\xa4\n\t// \xe2\x8e\xa2144.0  162.0\xe2\x8e\xa5\n\t// \xe2\x8e\xa3234.0  252.0\xe2\x8e\xa6\n}\n```\n\nIf this is run normally:\n\n```\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nCUDA will not be used.\n\nIf the program is to be run using CUDA, then this must be invoked:\n\n```\ngo run -tags=\'cuda\'\n```\n\nAnd even so, only the `tanh` function uses CUDA. \n\n### Rationale ###\n\nThe main reasons for having such complicated requirements for using CUDA is quite simply performance related. As Dave Cheney famously wrote, [cgo is not Go](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/01/18/cgo-is-not-go). To use CUDA, cgo is unfortunately required. And to use cgo, plenty of tradeoffs need to be made.\n\nTherefore the solution was to nestle the CUDA related code in a build tag, `cuda`. That way by default no cgo is used (well, kind-of - you could still use `cblas` or `blase`). \n\nThe reason for requiring [CUDA toolkit 8.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) is because there are many CUDA [Compute Capabilities](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compute-capabilities), and generating code for them all would yield a huge binary for no real good reason. Rather, users are encouraged to compile for their specific Compute Capabilities.\n\nLastly, the reason for requiring an explicit specification to use CUDA for which ops is due to the cost of cgo calls. Additional work is being done currently to implement batched cgo calls,  but until that is done, the solution is keyhole "upgrade" of certain ops\n\n### `Op`s supported by CUDA ###\n\nAs of now, only the very basic simple ops support CUDA: \n\nElementwise unary operations:\n\n* `abs`\n* `sin`\n* `cos`\n* `exp`\n* `ln`\n* `log2`\n* `neg`\n* `square`\n* `sqrt`\n* `inv` (reciprocal of a number)\n* `cube`\n* `tanh`\n* `sigmoid`\n* `log1p`\n* `expm1`\n* `softplus`\n\nElementwise binary operations - only arithmetic operations support CUDA:\n\n* `add`\n* `sub`\n* `mul`\n* `div`\n* `pow`\n\nFrom a lot of profiling of this author\'s personal projects, the ones that really matter are `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `expm1`, `exp` and `cube` - basically the activation functions. The other operations do work fine with MKL+AVX and aren\'t the major cause of slowness in a neural network\n\n### CUDA improvements ###\n\nIn a trivial benchmark, careful use of CUDA (in this case, used to call `sigmoid`) shows impressive improvements over non-CUDA code (bearing in mind the CUDA kernel is extremely naive and not optimized):\n\n```\nBenchmarkOneMilCUDA-8   \t     300\t   3348711 ns/op\nBenchmarkOneMil-8       \t      50\t  33169036 ns/op\n```\n\n\n# API Stability #\nGorgonia\'s API is as of right now, not considered stable. It will be stable from version 1.0 forwards.\n\n# Roadmap #\n\nHere are the goals for Gorgonia, sorted by importance \n\n- [ ] 80+% test coverage. Current coverage is 50% for Gorgonia and 80% for the `tensor`.\n- [ ] More advanced operations (like `einsum`). The current Tensor operators are pretty primitive.\n- [x] TravisCI for this package.\n- [x] Coveralls for this package.\n- [x] Clean out the tests. The tests were the results of many years of accumulation. It\'d be nice to refactor them out nicely. Use table driven tests where possible. Use `testing/quick` where possible.\n- [x] Improve performance especially re: allocation, minimize impact of type system.\n- [x] Improve Op extensibility by exposing/changing the Op interface to be all exported, and not a mix of exported and unexported methods (Alternatively, create a `Compose` Op type for extensibility). This way everyone can make their own custom `Op`s.\n- [ ] Refactor the CuBLAS package as well as the Blase package to follow in vein of the CUDA implementation.\n- [ ] Distributed computing. The ability to spread jobs out across multiple machines and communicating with each other has been attempted at least 3 times, but failed each time.\n- [ ] Better documentation on why certain decisions were made, and the design of Gorgonia in general.\n- [ ] Higher order derivative optimization algorithms (LBFGS comes to mind)\n- [ ] Derivative-free optimization algorithms\n\n# Goals #\n\nThe primary goal for Gorgonia is to be a *highly performant* machine learning/graph computation-based library that can scale across multiple machines. It should bring the appeal of Go (simple compilation and deployment process) to the ML world. It\'s a long way from there currently, however, the baby steps are already there.\n\nThe secondary goal for Gorgonia is to provide a platform for exploration for non-standard deep-learning and neural network related things. This includes things like neo-hebbian learning, corner-cutting algorithms, evolutionary algorithms and the like. \n\n\n# Contributing #\n\nObviously since you are most probably reading this on Github, Github will form the major part of the workflow for contributing to this package.\n\nSee also: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n\n## Contributors and Significant Contributors ##\nAll contributions are welcome. However, there is a new class of contributor, called Significant Contributors. \n\nA Significant Contributor is one who has shown *deep understanding* of how the library works and/or its environs.  Here are examples of what constitutes a Significant Contribution:\n\n* Wrote significant amounts of documentation pertaining to **why**/the mechanics of particular functions/methods and how the different parts affect one another\n* Wrote code, and tests around the more intricately connected parts of Gorgonia\n* Wrote code and tests, and have at least 5 pull requests accepted\n* Provided expert analysis on parts of the package (for example, you may be a floating point operations expert who optimized one function)\n* Answered at least 10 support questions.\n\nSignificant Contributors list will be updated once a month (if anyone even uses Gorgonia that is).\n\n# How To Get Support #\nThe best way of support right now is to open a [ticket on Github](https://github.com/gorgonia/gorgonia/issues/new).\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions #\n\n### Why are there seemingly random `runtime.GC()` calls in the tests? ###\n\nThe answer to this is simple - the design of the package uses CUDA in a particular way: specifically, a CUDA device and context is tied to a `VM`, instead of at the package level. This means for every `VM` created, a different CUDA context is created per device per `VM`. This way all the operations will play nicely with other applications that may be using CUDA (this needs to be stress-tested, however). \n\nThe CUDA contexts are only destroyed when the `VM` gets garbage collected (with the help of a finalizer function). In the tests, about 100 `VM`s get created, and garbage collection for the most part can be considered random. This leads to cases where the GPU runs out of memory as there are too many contexts being used. \n\nTherefore at the end of any tests that may use GPU, a `runtime.GC()` call is made to force garbage collection, freeing GPU memories.\n\nIn production, one is unlikely to start that many `VM`s, therefore it\'s not really a problem. If there is, open a ticket on Github, and we\'ll look into adding a `Finish()` method for the `VM`s.\n\n\n# Licence #\n\nGorgonia is licenced under a variant of Apache 2.0.
