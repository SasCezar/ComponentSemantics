SHAP connects game theory with local explanations, uniting several previous methods [1-7] and representing the only possible consistent and locally accurate additive feature attribution method based on expectations (see our [papers](#citations) for details and citations).\n\n\n\n## Install\n\nSHAP can be installed from either [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/shap) or [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/shap):\n\n<pre>\npip install shap\n<i>or</i>\nconda install -c conda-forge shap\n</pre>\n\n## Tree ensemble example with TreeExplainer (XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost/scikit-learn/pyspark models)\n\nWhile SHAP values can explain the output of any machine learning model, we have developed a high-speed exact algorithm for tree ensemble methods ([Tree SHAP arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03888)). Fast C++ implementations are supported for *XGBoost*, *LightGBM*, *CatBoost*, *scikit-learn* and *pyspark* tree models:\n\n```python\nimport xgboost\nimport shap\n\n# load JS visualization code to notebook\nshap.initjs()\n\n# train XGBoost model\nX,y = shap.datasets.boston()\nmodel = xgboost.train({"learning_rate": 0.01}, xgboost.DMatrix(X, label=y), 100)\n\n# explain the model\'s predictions using SHAP values\n# (same syntax works for LightGBM, CatBoost, scikit-learn and spark models)\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)\n\n# visualize the first prediction\'s explanation (use matplotlib=True to avoid Javascript)\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value, shap_values[0,:], X.iloc[0,:])\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="811" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slundberg/shap/master/docs/artwork/boston_instance.png" />\n</p>\n\n<!--If you want to use `matplotlib` backend in place of javascript, you can do so as shown below. You can also rotate the feature names using `text_rotation` parameter, if your dataset has really long feature names.\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\nimport xgboost\nimport shap\n\n# train XGBoost model\nX,y = shap.datasets.boston()\n\nmodel = xgboost.train({"learning_rate": 0.01}, xgboost.DMatrix(X, label=y), 100)\n# explain the model\'s predictions using SHAP values\n# (same syntax works for LightGBM, CatBoost, scikit-learn and spark models)\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)\n# visualize the first prediction\'s explanation using matplotlib (no javascript needed)\n# rotate the annotations so that they are legible when you have really long attribute names\nshap.force_plot(\n    explainer.expected_value, \n    shap_values[0, :], \n    X.iloc[0, :], \n    matplotlib=True, \n    text_rotation=30, \n    show=True\n)\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="811" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vatsan/shap/master/docs/artwork/force_plot_matplotlib_rotate.png" />\n</p>-->\n\nThe above explanation shows features each contributing to push the model output from the base value (the average model output over the training dataset we passed) to the model output. Features pushing the prediction higher are shown in red, those pushing the prediction lower are in blue (these force plots are introduced in our [Nature BME paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-018-0304-0)).\n\nIf we take many explanations such as the one shown above, rotate them 90 degrees, and then stack them horizontally, we can see explanations for an entire dataset (in the notebook this plot is interactive):\n\n```python\n# visualize the training set predictions\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value, shap_values, X)\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="811" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slundberg/shap/master/docs/artwork/boston_dataset.png" />\n</p>\n\nTo understand how a single feature effects the output of the model we can plot the SHAP value of that feature vs. the value of the feature for all the examples in a dataset. Since SHAP values represent a feature\'s responsibility for a change in the model output, the plot below represents the change in predicted house price as RM (the average number of rooms per house in an area) changes. Vertical dispersion at a single value of RM represents interaction effects with other features. To help reveal these interactions `dependence_plot` automatically selects another feature for coloring. In this case coloring by RAD (index of accessibility to radial highways) highlights that the average number of rooms per house has less impact on home price for areas with a high RAD value.\n\n```python\n# create a SHAP dependence plot to show the effect of a single feature across the whole dataset\nshap.dependence_plot("RM", shap_values, X)\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="544" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slundberg/shap/master/docs/artwork/boston_dependence_plot.png" />\n</p>\n\n\nTo get an overview of which features are most important for a model we can plot the SHAP values of every feature for every sample. The plot below sorts features by the sum of SHAP value magnitudes over all samples, and uses SHAP values to show the distribution of the impacts each feature has on the model output. The color represents the feature value (red high, blue low). This reveals for example that a high LSTAT (% lower status of the population) lowers the predicted home price.\n\n```python\n# summarize the effects of all the features\nshap.summary_plot(shap_values, X)\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="483" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slundberg/shap/master/docs/artwork/boston_summary_plot.png" />\n</p>\n\nWe can also just take the mean absolute value of the SHAP values for each feature to get a standard bar plot (produces stacked bars for multi-class outputs):\n\n```python\nshap.summary_plot(shap_values, X, plot_type="bar")\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="470" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slundberg/shap/master/docs/artwork/boston_summary_plot_bar.png" />\n</p>\n\n## Deep learning example with DeepExplainer (TensorFlow/Keras models)\n\nDeep SHAP is a high-speed approximation algorithm for SHAP values in deep learning models that builds on a connection with [DeepLIFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02685) described in the SHAP NIPS paper. The implementation here differs from the original DeepLIFT by using a distribution of background samples instead of a single reference value, and using Shapley equations to linearize components such as max, softmax, products, divisions, etc. Note that some of these enhancements have also been since integrated into DeepLIFT. TensorFlow models and Keras models using the TensorFlow backend are supported (there is also preliminary support for PyTorch):\n\n```python\n# ...include code from https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py\n\nimport shap\nimport numpy as np\n\n# select a set of background examples to take an expectation over\nbackground = x_train[np.random.choice(x_train.shape[0], 100, replace=False)]\n\n# explain predictions of the model on four images\ne = shap.DeepExplainer(model, background)\n# ...or pass tensors directly\n# e = shap.DeepExplainer((model.layers[0].input, model.layers[-1].output), background)\nshap_values = e.shap_values(x_test[1:5])\n\n# plot the feature attributions\nshap.image_plot(shap_values, -x_test[1:5])\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="820" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slundberg/shap/master/docs/artwork/mnist_image_plot.png" />\n</p>\n\nThe plot above explains ten outputs (digits 0-9) for four different images. Red pixels increase the model\'s output while blue pixels decrease the output. The input images are shown on the left, and as nearly transparent grayscale backings behind each of the explanations. The sum of the SHAP values equals the difference between the expected model output (averaged over the background dataset) and the current model output. Note that for the \'zero\' image the blank middle is important, while for the \'four\' image the lack of a connection on top makes it a four instead of a nine.\n\n\n## Deep learning example with GradientExplainer (TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch models)\n\nExpected gradients combines ideas from [Integrated Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365), SHAP, and [SmoothGrad](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03825) into a single expected value equation. This allows an entire dataset to be used as the background distribution (as opposed to a single reference value) and allows local smoothing. If we approximate the model with a linear function between each background data sample and the current input to be explained, and we assume the input features are independent then expected gradients will compute approximate SHAP values. In the example below we have explained how the 7th intermediate layer of the VGG16 ImageNet model impacts the output probabilities.\n\n```python\nfrom keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16\nfrom keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input\nimport keras.backend as K\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\nimport shap\n\n# load pre-trained model and choose two images to explain\nmodel = VGG16(weights=\'imagenet\', include_top=True)\nX,y = shap.datasets.imagenet50()\nto_explain = X[[39,41]]\n\n# load the ImageNet class names\nurl = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/deep-learning-models/image-models/imagenet_class_index.json"\nfname = shap.datasets.cache(url)\nwith open(fname) as f:\n    class_names = json.load(f)\n\n# explain how the input to the 7th layer of the model explains the top two classes\ndef map2layer(x, layer):\n    feed_dict = dict(zip([model.layers[0].input], [preprocess_input(x.copy())]))\n    return K.get_session().run(model.layers[layer].input, feed_dict)\ne = shap.GradientExplainer(\n    (model.layers[7].input, model.layers[-1].output),\n    map2layer(X, 7),\n    local_smoothing=0 # std dev of smoothing noise\n)\nshap_values,indexes = e.shap_values(map2layer(to_explain, 7), ranked_outputs=2)\n\n# get the names for the classes\nindex_names = np.vectorize(lambda x: class_names[str(x)][1])(indexes)\n\n# plot the explanations\nshap.image_plot(shap_values, to_explain, index_names)\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="500" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slundberg/shap/master/docs/artwork/gradient_imagenet_plot.png" />\n</p>\n\nPredictions for two input images are explained in the plot above. Red pixels represent positive SHAP values that increase the probability of the class, while blue pixels represent negative SHAP values the reduce the probability of the class. By using `ranked_outputs=2` we explain only the two most likely classes for each input (this spares us from explaining all 1,000 classes).\n\n## Model agnostic example with KernelExplainer (explains any function)\n\nKernel SHAP uses a specially-weighted local linear regression to estimate SHAP values for any model. Below is a simple example for explaining a multi-class SVM on the classic iris dataset.\n\n```python\nimport sklearn\nimport shap\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# print the JS visualization code to the notebook\nshap.initjs()\n\n# train a SVM classifier\nX_train,X_test,Y_train,Y_test = train_test_split(*shap.datasets.iris(), test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\nsvm = sklearn.svm.SVC(kernel=\'rbf\', probability=True)\nsvm.fit(X_train, Y_train)\n\n# use Kernel SHAP to explain test set predictions\nexplainer = shap.KernelExplainer(svm.predict_proba, X_train, link="logit")\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test, nsamples=100)\n\n# plot the SHAP values for the Setosa output of the first instance\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[0], shap_values[0][0,:], X_test.iloc[0,:], link="logit")\n```\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="810" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slundberg/shap/master/docs/artwork/iris_instance.png" />\n</p>\n\nThe above explanation shows four features each contributing to push the model output from the base value (the average model output over the training dataset we passed) towards zero. If there were any features pushing the class label higher they would be shown in red.\n\nIf we take many explanations such as the one shown above, rotate them 90 degrees, and then stack them horizontally, we can see explanations for an entire dataset. This is exactly what we do below for all the examples in the iris test set:\n\n```python\n# plot the SHAP values for the Setosa output of all instances\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[0], shap_values[0], X_test, link="logit")\n```\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="813" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slundberg/shap/master/docs/artwork/iris_dataset.png" />\n</p>\n\n## SHAP Interaction Values\n\nSHAP interaction values are a generalization of SHAP values to higher order interactions. Fast exact computation of pairwise interactions are implemented for tree models with `shap.TreeExplainer(model).shap_interaction_values(X)`. This returns a matrix for every prediction, where the main effects are on the diagonal and the interaction effects are off-diagonal. These values often reveal interesting hidden relationships, such as how the increased risk of death peaks for men at age 60 (see the NHANES notebook for details):\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="483" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slundberg/shap/master/docs/artwork/nhanes_age_sex_interaction.png" />\n</p>\n\n## Sample notebooks\n\nThe notebooks below demonstrate different use cases for SHAP.
