To install Snorkel, we recommend using `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install snorkel\n```\n\nor `conda`:\n\n```bash\nconda install snorkel -c conda-forge\n```\n\nFor information on installing from source and contributing to Snorkel, see our\n[contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n<details><summary><b>Details on installing with <tt>conda</tt></b></summary>\n<p>\n\nThe following example commands give some more color on installing with `conda`.\nThese commands assume that your `conda` installation is Python 3.6,\nand that you want to use a virtual environment called `snorkel-env`.\n\n```bash\n# [OPTIONAL] Activate a virtual environment called "snorkel"\nconda create --yes -n snorkel-env python=3.6\nconda activate snorkel-env\n\n# We specify PyTorch here to ensure compatibility, but it may not be necessary.\nconda install pytorch==1.1.0 -c pytorch\nconda install snorkel==0.9.0 -c conda-forge\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><b>A quick note for Windows users</b></summary>\n<p>\n\nIf you\'re using Windows, we highly recommend using Docker\n(you can find an example in our\n[tutorials repo](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials/blob/master/Dockerfile))\nor the [Linux subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq).\nWe\'ve done limited testing on Windows, so if you want to contribute instructions\nor improvements, feel free to open a PR!\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n# Discussion\n\n## Issues\nWe use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel/issues) for posting bugs and feature requests \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0anything code-related.\nJust make sure you search for related issues first and use our Issues templates.\nWe may ask for contributions if a prompt fix doesn\'t fit into the immediate roadmap of the core development team.\n\n## Contributions\nWe welcome contributions from the Snorkel community! \nThis is likely the fastest way to get a change you\'d like to see into the library.\n\nSmall contributions can be made directly in a pull request (PR).\nIf you would like to contribute a larger feature, we recommend first creating an issue with a proposed design for discussion. \nFor ideas about what to work on, we\'ve labeled specific issues as [`help wanted`](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+).\n\nTo set up a development environment for contributing back to Snorkel, see our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\nAll PRs must pass the continuous integration tests and receive approval from a member of the Snorkel development team before they will be merged.\n\n## Community Forum\nFor broader Q&A, discussions about using Snorkel, tutorial requests, etc.,\xc2\xa0use the [Snorkel community forum](https://spectrum.chat/snorkel) hosted on Spectrum.\nWe hope this will be a venue for you to interact with other Snorkel users \xe2\x80\x94 please don\'t be shy about posting!\n\n## Announcements\nTo stay up-to-date on Snorkel-related announcements (e.g. version releases, upcoming workshops), subscribe to the [Snorkel mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/snorkel-ml). We promise to respect your inboxes \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0communication will be sparse!\n\n## Twitter\nFollow us on Twitter [@SnorkelML](https://twitter.com/SnorkelML).\n'
