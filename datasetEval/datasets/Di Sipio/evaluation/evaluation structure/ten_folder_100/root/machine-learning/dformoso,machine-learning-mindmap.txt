b"# Machine Learning Mindmap / Cheatsheet\nA Mindmap summarising Machine Learning concepts, from Data Analysis to Deep Learning.\n\n## Overview\nMachine Learning is a subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.\n\nMachine Learning is as fascinating as it is broad in scope. It spans over multiple fields in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Neuroscience. This is an attempt to summarize this enormous field in one .PDF file.\n\n## Download\nDownload the PDF here:\n> https://github.com/dformoso/machine-learning-mindmap/blob/master/Machine%20Learning.pdf\n\nSame, but with a white background:\n> https://github.com/dformoso/machine-learning-mindmap/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20-%20White%20BG.pdf\n\nI've built the mindmap with MindNode for Mac. https://mindnode.com\n\n## Companion Notebook\nThis Mindmap/Cheatsheet has a companion Jupyter Notebook that runs through most of the Data Science steps that can be found at the following link:\n> https://github.com/dformoso/sklearn-classification\n\n## Mindmap on Deep Learning\nHere's another mindmap which focuses only on Deep Learning\n> https://github.com/dformoso/deeplearning-mindmap\n\n## 1. Process\nThe Data Science it's not a set-and-forget effort, but a process that requires design, implementation and maintenance. The PDF contains a quick overview of what's involved. Here's a quick screenshot.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/dformoso/machine-learning-mindmap/blob/master/images/Process.png)\n\n## 2. Data Processing\nFirst, we'll need some data. We must find it, collect it, clean it, and about 5 other steps. Here's a sample of what's required.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/dformoso/machine-learning-mindmap/blob/master/images/Data%20Processing.png)\n\n## 3. Mathematics\nMachine Learning is a house built on Math bricks. Browse through the most common components, and send your feedback if you see something missing.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/dformoso/machine-learning-mindmap/blob/master/images/Mathematics.png)\n\n## 4. Concepts\nA partial list of the types, categories, approaches, libraries, and methodology.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/dformoso/machine-learning-mindmap/blob/master/images/Concepts.png)\n\n## 5. Models\nA sampling of the most popular models. Send your comments to add more.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/dformoso/machine-learning-mindmap/blob/master/images/Models.png)\n\n\n## References\nI'm planning to build a more complete list of references in the future.
