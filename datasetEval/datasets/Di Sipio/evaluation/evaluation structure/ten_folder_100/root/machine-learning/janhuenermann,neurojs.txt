It mainly focuses on reinforcement learning, but can be used for any neural network based task. It contains neat demos to visualise these capabilities, for instance a 2D self-driving car. \n\nFeel free to contribute. The development on such projects is more awesome in a community!\n\n**Note: this repo is no longer maintained since more general frameworks such as TensorFlow-JS emerged, which I recommend you to use.**\n\n### Features\n- Implements a full-stack neural-network based machine learning framework\n- Extended reinforcement-learning support\n\t+ Uniform and prioritised replay buffers\n\t+ Advantage-learning (increasing the action-gap) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04860v1.pdf\n\t+ Support for **deep-q-networks** and **actor-critic** models (via deep-deterministic-policy-gradients)\n- Binary import and export of network configurations (weights etc.)\n- High-performance\n\n### Examples\n- [Self-driving car](/examples/cars)\n- [Advanced XOR](/examples/adv-xor)\n- [Andrej Karpathy\'s Waterworld](/examples/waterworld) (ConvNetJS replaced with NeuroJS)\n\n### Running the examples\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nOpen `http://localhost:8080/examples/` in your browser and select the demo you want to run.\n\n### What\'s next?\n- More examples (pong, pendulum, snake,improved cars, etc.)\n- Support for web workers\n- LSTM and backpropagation through time\n'
