b'# Teachable Machine \n## About\nTeachable Machine is an experiment that makes it easier for anyone to explore machine learning, live in the browser \xe2\x80\x93 no coding required. Learn more about the experiment and try it yourself on [g.co/teachablemachine](https://g.co/teachablemachine). \n\nThe experiment is built using the [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) library.\n\nWe have also released a boilerplate version of this project that can be used as a starting point for your own projects: [googlecreativelab/teachable-machine-boilerplate](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/teachable-machine-boilerplate)\n\n## Development\n#### Install dependencies by running (similar to `npm install`)\n```\nyarn\n```\n\n#### Build project\n```\nyarn build\n```\n\n#### Start local server by running \n```\nyarn run watch\n```\n\n#### Code Styles\n- There\xe2\x80\x99s a pre-commit hook set up that will prevent commits when there are errors\n- Run `yarn eslint` for es6 errors & warnings\n- Run `yarn stylint` for stylus errors & warnings\n\n#### To run https locally:\nhttps is required to get camera permissions to work when not working with `localhost`\n\n1. Generate Keys\n```\nopenssl genrsa -out server.key 2048\nopenssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key server.key -out server.cer -days 365 -subj /CN=YOUR_IP\n```\n2. Use `yarn run watch-https`\n3. Go to `https://YOUR_IP:3000`, then accept the insecure privacy notice, and proceed.\n\n## Credit\nThis is not an official Google product, but an experiment that was a collaborative effort by friends from [St\xc3\xb8j](http://stoj.io/), [Use All Five](https://useallfive.com/) and Creative Lab and [PAIR](https://ai.google/pair/) teams at Google.\n'
