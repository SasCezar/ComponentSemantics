We are also part of the _Data Science for Civic Innovation Programme_ from [Open Knowledge Brasil](http://br.okfn.org).\n\nAmong founders and long-term members, we can list a group of eight people \xe2\x80\x93 plus numerous contributors from the open source and open knowledge communities:  [Tatiana Balachova](https://tatianasb.ru), [Felipe Cabral](https://twitter.com/felipebcabral), [Eduardo Cuducos](https://cuducos.me),  [Irio Musskopf](https://iriomk.com), [Bruno Pazzim](http://brunopazzim.com/), [Ana Schwendler](http://anaschwendler.com/), [Jessica Temporal](http://jtemporal.com/), [Yasodara C\xc3\xb3rdova](https://twitter.com/yaso) and [Pedro Vilanova](https://twitter.com/pedrovilanova).\n\n### How\n\nSimilar to organizations like Google, Facebook, and Netflix, we use technology to track government spendings and make open data accessible for everyone. We started looking into data from the Chamber of Deputies (Brazilian lower house) but we expanded to the Federal Senate (Brazilian upper house) and to municipalities.\n\n### When\n\nIrio had the main ideas for the project in early 2016. For a few months, he experimented and gathered people around the project. September, 2016 marks the launching of [our first crowd funding](https://catarse.me/serenata). Since then, we have been creating open source technological products and tools, as well as high quality content on civic tech on our [Facebook](https://fb.com/operacaoserenatadeamor) and [Medium](https://medium.com/serenata).\n\n### Where\n\nWe have no non-virtual headquarters, but we work remotely everyday. Most of our ideas are crafted to work in any country that offers open data, but our main implementations focus in Brazil.\n\n### Why\n\nEmpowering citizens with data is important: people talk about _smart cities_, _surveillance_ and _privacy_. We prefer to focus on _smart citizens_, _accountability_ and _open knowledge_.\n\n## Tech crash course into Opera\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o Serenata de Amor\n\n### What\n\nSerenata de Amor develops open source tools to make it easy for people to use open data. The focus is to gather relevant insights and share them in an accessible interface. Through this interface, we invite citizens to dialogue with politicians, state and government about public spendings.\n\n### Who\n\nSerenata's main role is played by [Rosie](rosie/README.md): she is an artificial intelligence who analyzes Brazilian congresspeople expenses while they are in office. Rosie can find suspicious spendings and engage citizens in the discussion about these findings. [She's on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RosieDaSerenata).\n\nTo allow people to visualize and make sense of data Rosie generates, we have created [Jarbas](jarbas/README.md). On this website, users can browse congresspeople expenses and get details about each of the suspicions. It is the starting point to validate a suspicion.\n\n### How\n\nWe have two main repositories [on GitHub](https://github.com/okfn-brasil). This is the _main repo_ and hosts [Rosie](rosie/README.md) and [Jarbas](jarbas/README.md). In addition, we have the [toolbox](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/serenata-toolbox) - a `pip` installable package. Yet there are experimental [notebooks](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/notebooks) maintained by the community and our [static webpage](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/serenata-website).\n\n### When\n\nDespite all these players acting together, the core part of the job is ran manually from time to time. The only part that is always online is Jarbas \xe2\x80\x93 freely serving a wide range of information about public expenditure 24/7.\n\nRoughly once a month, we manually run Rosie and update Jarbas. A few times per year, we upload versioned datasets accessible via the toolbox \xe2\x80\x93 but we encourage you to use the toolbox to generate fresh datasets whenever you need.\n\n### Where\n\nJarbas is running in [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) droplets, and deployed using the [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/) architecture.\n\n### Why\n\nThe answer to most technical _why_ questions is because that is what we had in the past and enabled us to deliver fast. We acknowledge that this is not the best stack ever, but it has brought us here.\n\n## Contributing with code and tech skills\n\nMake sure you have read the _Tech crash course_ on this page.
