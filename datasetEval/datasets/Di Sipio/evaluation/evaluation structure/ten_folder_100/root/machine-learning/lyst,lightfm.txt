It's easy to use, fast (via multithreaded model estimation), and produces high quality results.\n\nIt also makes it possible to incorporate both item and user metadata into the traditional matrix factorization algorithms. It represents each user and item as the sum of the latent representations of their features, thus allowing recommendations to generalise to new items (via item features) and to new users (via user features).\n\nFor more details, see the [Documentation](http://lyst.github.io/lightfm/docs/home.html).\n\nNeed help?

Only five\n# star ratings are treated as positive.\ndata = fetch_movielens(min_rating=5.0)\n\n# Instantiate and train the model\nmodel = LightFM(loss='warp')\nmodel.fit(data['train'], epochs=30, num_threads=2)\n\n# Evaluate the trained model\ntest_precision = precision_at_k(model, data['test'], k=5).mean()\n```\n\n## Articles and tutorials on using LightFM\n1.

To install for development:\n\n1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:lyst/lightfm.git`\n2. Install it for development using pip: `cd lightfm && pip install -e .`\n3. You can run tests by running `python setup.py test`.\n4. LightFM uses [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) (version `18.6b4`) to enforce code formatting.\n\nWhen making changes to the `.pyx` extension files, you'll need to run `python setup.py cythonize` in order to produce the extension `.c` files before running `pip install -e .`.\n"
