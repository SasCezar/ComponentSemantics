Vespa is a platform which performs these operations for you. It has been in development for many years \nand is used on a number of large internet services and apps which serve hundreds of thousands of queries from \nVespa per second.\n\n## Install\n\nTo get started using Vespa pick one of the quick start documents:\n\n- [Run on a Mac or Linux machine using Docker](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/vespa-quick-start.html)\n- [Run on a Windows machine using Docker](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/vespa-quick-start-windows.html)\n- [Run on a Mac or Linux machine using VirtualBox+Vagrant](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/vespa-quick-start-centos.html)\n- [Multinode install on AWS EC2](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/vespa-quick-start-multinode-aws.html)\n- [Multinode install on AWS ECS](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/vespa-quick-start-multinode-aws-ecs.html)\n\n## Usage \n\n- The application created in the quickstart is fully functional and production ready, but you may want to [add more nodes](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/multinode-systems.html) for redundancy.\n- Try the [Blog search and recommendation tutorial](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/tutorials/blog-search.html) to learn more about using Vespa\n- See [developing applications](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/jdisc/developing-applications.html) on adding your own Java components to your Vespa application.\n- [Vespa APIs](https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/api.html) is useful to understand how to interface with Vespa\n- Explore the [sample applications](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master)\n\nFull documentation is available on [https://docs.vespa.ai](https://docs.vespa.ai).\n\n## Contribute\n\nWe welcome contributions! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to contribute.\n\nIf you want to contribute to the documentation, see\n[https://github.com/vespa-engine/documentation](https://github.com/vespa-engine/documentation)\n\n\n## Building\n\nYou do not need to build Vespa to use it, but if you want to contribute you need to be able to build the code.\nThis section explains how to build and test Vespa. To understand where to make changes, see [Code-map.md](Code-map.md).\nSome suggested improvements with pointers to code are in [TODO.md](TODO.md).\n\n### Set up the build environment\n\nC++ and Java building is supported on CentOS 7. The Java source can also be built on any platform having Java 11 and Maven installed. \nWe recommend using the following environment: [Create C++ / Java dev environment on CentOS using VirtualBox and Vagrant](vagrant/README.md).\nYou can also setup CentOS 7 natively and install the following build dependencies:\n\n    sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/vespa/vespa/repo/epel-7/group_vespa-vespa-epel-7.repo\n    sudo yum -y install epel-release centos-release-scl yum-utils\n    sudo yum -y install ccache \\\n        rpm-build\n    yum-builddep -y <vespa-source>/dist/vespa.spec\n\n### Build Java modules\n\n    export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms128m -Xmx1024m"\n    source /opt/rh/rh-maven35/enable\n    bash bootstrap.sh java\n    mvn -T <num-threads> install\n\n### Build C++ modules\n\nReplace `<build-dir>` with the name of the directory in which you\'d like to build Vespa.\nReplace `<source-dir>` with the directory in which you\'ve cloned/unpacked the source tree.\n\n    bash bootstrap-cpp.sh <source-dir> <build-dir>\n    cd <build-dir>\n    make -j <num-threads>\n    ctest3 -j <num-threads>\n\n### Create RPM packages\n\n    sh dist.sh VERSION && rpmbuild -ba ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/vespa-VERSION.spec\n    \n## License\n\nCode licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
