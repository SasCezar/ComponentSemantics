To learn how it can best be combined with Prisma, check out the [`nexus-prisma`](https://github.com/prisma-labs/nexus-prisma) plugin.\n\n## Overview\n\n- **Code-first**: Programmatically define your GraphQL types in JavaScript/TypeScript\n- **Compatible with the GraphQL ecosystem**: Nexus is based on `graphql-js`\n- **Type-safe**: Nexus enables auto-completion and error checks in your IDE (even for JS)\n- **Generates SDL & TS definitions**: SDL schema and typings are updated as you code\n\n## Examples\n\n**"Hello World" GraphQL server with `graphql-yoga`**\n\n```ts\nimport { queryType, stringArg, makeSchema } from "nexus";\nimport { GraphQLServer } from "graphql-yoga";\n\nconst Query = queryType({\n  definition(t) {\n    t.string("hello", {\n      args: { name: stringArg({ nullable: true }) },\n      resolve: (parent, { name }) => `Hello ${name || "World"}!`,\n    });\n  },\n});\n\nconst schema = makeSchema({\n  types: [Query],\n  outputs: {\n    schema: __dirname + "/generated/schema.graphql",\n    typegen: __dirname + "/generated/typings.ts",\n  },\n});\n\nconst server = new GraphQLServer({\n  schema,\n});\n\nserver.start(() => `Server is running on http://localhost:4000`);\n```\n\nAll examples of GraphQL Nexus can be found in the [`/examples`](./examples) directory:\n\n- [githunt-api](./examples/githunt-api)\n- [ts-ast-reader](./examples/ts-ast-reader)\n- [apollo-fullstack](./examples/apollo-fullstack)\n- [star-wars](./examples/star-wars)\n- [kitchen-sink](./examples/kitchen-sink)\n\nIf you\'re interested in examples using the [`nexus-prisma`](https://github.com/prisma-labs/nexus-prisma) plugin, check out the official [`prisma-examples`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/) repo:\n\n- [GraphQL blogging app](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/master/typescript/graphql)\n- [GraphQL blogging app with authentication & authorization](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/master/typescript/graphql-auth)\n- [GraphQL CRUD example](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/master/typescript/graphql-crud)\n\n## Features\n\n- Expressive, declarative API for building schemas\n- No need to re-declare interface fields per-object\n- Optionally possible to reference types by name (with autocomplete) rather than needing to import every single piece of the schema\n- Assumes non-null by default, but makes this configurable on per-schema/per-type basis\n- Interoperable with vanilla `graphql-js` types, and it\'s _just_ a [`GraphQLSchema`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema) so it fits in just fine with existing community solutions of `apollo-server`, `graphql-middleware`, etc.\n- Inline function resolvers for when you need to do simple field aliasing\n- Auto-generated graphql SDL schema, great for when seeing how any code changes affected the schema\n- Lots of good [examples](https://github.com/prisma-labs/nexus/tree/develop/examples) to get you started and thorough [API documentation](https://nexus.js.org/docs/api-core-concepts)\n- Full type-safety for free\n- Internal structure allows library authors to build more advanced abstractions\n- Independent from Prisma, but integrates nicely using the [`nexus-prisma`](https://github.com/prisma-labs/nexus-prisma) plugin\n- Allows code re-use by creating higher level "functions" which wrap common fields\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find the docs for GraphQL Nexus [here](https://nexus.js.org).\n\n## Install\n\nGraphQL Nexus can be installed via the `nexus` package. It also requires `graphql` as a [peer dependency](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/):\n\n```\nnpm install --save nexus graphql\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nyarn add nexus graphql\n```\n\n## Migrate from SDL\n\nIf you\'ve been following an [SDL-first](https://www.prisma.io/blog/the-problems-of-schema-first-graphql-development-x1mn4cb0tyl3/) approach to build your GraphQL server and want to see what your code looks like when written with GraphQL Nexus, you can use the [**SDL converter**](https://nexus.js.org/converter):\n\n![](https://imgur.com/AbkFWNO.png)\n\n---\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n(c) 2018-2019 Tim Griesser\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
