You can more learn about the idea behind GraphQL boilerplates [here](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-boilerplates-graphql-create-how-to-setup-a-graphql-project-6428be2f3a5).\n\n## Quickstart\n\nSelect a boilerplate and follow the instructions in the belonging README to get started:\n\n- [`minimal`](./minimal): Minimal boilerplate with basic "Hello World" functionality\n- [`basic`](./basic): Basic boilerplate based on a simple data model and with a GraphQL database\n- [`advanced`](./advanced): Advanced boilerplate with a GraphQL database, authentication and realtime subscriptions\n\nAll projects are based on [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga/) & [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe GraphQL boilerplates are maintained by the GraphQL community, with official support from the [Apollo](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com) & [Graphcool](https://blog.graph.cool/) teams.\n\nYour feedback is **very helpful**, please share your opinion and thoughts!
