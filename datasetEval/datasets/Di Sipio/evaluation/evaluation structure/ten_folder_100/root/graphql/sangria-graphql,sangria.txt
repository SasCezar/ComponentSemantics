b'![Sangria Logo](http://sangria-graphql.org/assets/img/sangria-logo.svg)\n\n[Sangria](http://sangria-graphql.org/) is a scala [GraphQL](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/) library.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sangria-graphql/sangria.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sangria-graphql/sangria) [![Coverage Status](http://coveralls.io/repos/sangria-graphql/sangria/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](http://coveralls.io/github/sangria-graphql/sangria?branch=master) [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.sangria-graphql/sangria_2.11/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.sangria-graphql/sangria_2.11) [![License](http://img.shields.io/:license-Apache%202-brightgreen.svg)](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) [![Scaladocs](https://www.javadoc.io/badge/org.sangria-graphql/sangria_2.12.svg?label=docs)](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.sangria-graphql/sangria_2.12) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sangria-graphql/sangria](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/sangria-graphql/sangria?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\nSBT Configuration:\n\n```scala\nlibraryDependencies += "org.sangria-graphql" %% "sangria" % "1.4.2"\n``` \n\nYou can find an example application that uses akka-http with sangria here:\n\nhttps://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria-akka-http-example\n\nMore info and the documentation can be found in the project home page:\n\n[http://sangria-graphql.org](http://sangria-graphql.org)\n\nI would also recommend you to check out [http://try.sangria-graphql.org](http://try.sangria-graphql.org).\nIt is an example of GraphQL server written with Play framework and Sangria. It also serves as a playground,\nwhere you can interactively execute GraphQL queries and play with some examples.\n\nIf you want to use sangria with [react-relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay) framework, then you also may be interested in [sangria-relay](https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria-relay).\n\nSangria is a spec compliant GraphQL implementation, so it works out of the box with [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) and other GraphQL tools and libraries.\n\n\n## Hello World Example\n\nIn this example we will use [circe](https://github.com/circe/circe) JSON marshalling, so we also need to include following dependency:\n\n```scala\nlibraryDependencies += "org.sangria-graphql" %% "sangria-circe" % "1.2.1"\n```\n\nThe most simple Hello World application might look like this:\n\n```scala\nimport sangria.schema._\nimport sangria.execution._\nimport sangria.macros._\nimport sangria.marshalling.circe._\nimport scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global\n\nval QueryType = ObjectType("Query", fields[Unit, Unit](\n  Field("hello", StringType, resolve = _ \xe2\x87\x92 "Hello world!")\n))\n\nval schema = Schema(QueryType)\n\nval query = graphql"{ hello }"\n\nval result = Executor.execute(schema, query)\n\nresult.foreach(res \xe2\x87\x92 println(res.spaces2))\n```\n\nthis example will print following result JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  "data" : {\n    "hello" : "Hello world!"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor more complex example, I would recommend you to check out the [Getting Started Tutorial](https://sangria-graphql.org/getting-started/).\n\n## Issues, Bugs, Ideas\n\nIf you\'ve got some interesting ideas to share or discovered a nasty bug, feel free to use\n[Sangria\'s issue tracker](https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria/issues).\nAlso feel free to fork project and create the pull requests - they are highly appreciated!\n\nIf you are facing an issue and not sure what would be the best way to describe it, the I would recommend you to use [this minimal gist](https://gist.github.com/OlegIlyenko/4068ad92e008cd4b5def1baa4ec3a67c) as a template. \n\n## StackOverflow\n\nIn case you need some help or support, then you can use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sangria) for this.\nWhen you are [asking a question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=scala,graphql,sangria),\nbe sure to add `scala`, `graphql` and `sangria` tags, so that other people can easily find them.\n\n## Gitter & Mailing List \n\nFor more general, lengthy discussions or pretty much anything else please join us in the \n[gitter chat](https://gitter.im/sangria-graphql/sangria) and [google groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sangria-graphql).\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you like the project and would like to support it or contribute to it, then you are very welcome to do so.\nYou can spread the word and tweet about the project or even better - create a small blog post, video, example project and show how you use sangria and GraphQL.\nI\'m pretty sure it would be interesting for many people.\n\nAlso you can contribute to [the documentation](https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria-website) or help others by answering questions on\n[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sangria) or joining discussions at [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sangria-graphql) and [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/sangria-graphql/sangria).\nIt would be very helpful!\n\nNot to mention the code itself. There is nothing more exciting than hacking some stuff together :)\nSo please feel free to materialize your ideas in form of code and send pull requests! \n\n## License\n\n**Sangria** is licensed under [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n'
