It is provided along with a library that can be used in any Go application to implement the Mercure protocol directly (without a hub) and an official Docker image.\n\nIn addition, a managed and high-scalability version of Mercure is [available in private beta](mailto:dunglas+mercure@gmail.com?subject=I%27m%20interested%20in%20Mercure%27s%20private%20beta).\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Credits\n\nCreated by [K\xc3\xa9vin Dunglas](https://dunglas.fr).
