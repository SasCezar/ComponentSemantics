b'# GraphQL IDE Monorepo\n\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphql/graphiql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/graphql/graphiql)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/586999333447270440.svg)](https://discord.gg/RfY2dvr)\n\n[![](packages/graphiql/resources/graphiql.png)](https://graphiql-test.netlify.com/)\n\n## Intro\n\nGraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. The code uses the permissive MIT license.\n\nThe `graphql-language-service-interface` should be your go-to for language server protocol spec (LSP) implementations, which is now our first order IDE spec.\n\nThe purpose of this monorepo is to give folks a solid language service, and editor modes, and to show an example of how to use them with GraphiQL.\n\n\n## [GraphiQL](packages/graphiql#readme)\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/graphiql.svg)](https://npmjs.com/graphiql)\n[![CDNJS](https://img.shields.io/cdnjs/v/graphiql.svg)](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/graphiql)\n\n**Note**: We are aware that `graphiql.min.js` is not working as of `0.15.0`, and we are waiting for the resolution to be approved so we can re-release it. If you need to use a CDN build, you can use the unminified `graphiql.js` which is working for all versions.\n\n_/\xcb\x88\xc9\xa1raf\xc9\x99k(\xc9\x99)l/_ A graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE. [Try the live demo](http://graphql.org/swapi-graphql). We also have [a demo using our latest netlify build](http://graphiql-test.netlify.com) for the master branch.\n\nThe GraphiQL IDE, implemented in React, currently using [GraphQL mode for CodeMirror](packages/codemirror-graphql#readme) & [GraphQL Language Service](packages/graphql-language-service#readme).\n\n### How To Setup/Implement GraphiQL\nThe [GraphiQL Readme](packages/graphiql#readme) explains some of the ways to implement GraphiQL, and we also have the [examples](packages/examples) directory as well!\n\n## [GraphQL mode for CodeMirror](packages/codemirror-graphql#readme)\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/codemirror-graphql.svg)](https://npmjs.com/codemirror-graphql)\n\nProvides CodeMirror with a parser mode for GraphQL along with a live linter and typeahead hinter powered by your GraphQL Schema\n\n\n## [GraphQL Language Service](packages/graphql-language-service#readme)\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/graphql-language-service.svg)](https://npmjs.com/graphql-language-service)\n\nProvides an interface for building GraphQL language services for IDEs.\n\n\n##  [GraphQL Language Service Server](packages/graphql-language-service-server#readme)\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/graphql-language-service.svg)](https://npmjs.com/graphql-language-service)\n\nServer process backing the [GraphQL Language Service](packages/graphql-language-service#readme).\n\n\n## [GraphQL Language Service Interface](packages/graphql-language-service-interface#readme)\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/graphql-language-service-interface.svg)](https://npmjs.com/graphql-language-service-interface)\n\nLSP Interface to the [GraphQL Language Service](packages/graphql-language-service#readme)\n\n\n## [GraphQL Language Service Parser](packages/graphql-language-service-parser#readme)\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/graphql-language-service-parser.svg)](https://npmjs.com/graphql-language-service-parser)\n\nAn online immutable parser for [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/), designed to be used as part of syntax-highlighting and code intelligence tools such as for the [GraphQL Language Service](packages/graphql-language-service#readme) and [codemirror-graphql](packages/codemirror-graphql#readme).\n\n\n## [GraphQL Language Service Types](packages/graphql-language-service-types#readme)\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/graphql-language-service-types.svg)](https://npmjs.com/graphql-language-service-types)\n\n[Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type definitions for the [GraphQL Language Service](packages/graphql-language-service#readme).\n\n\n## [GraphQL Language Service Utilities](packages/graphql-language-service-utils#readme)\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/graphql-language-service-utils.svg)](https://npmjs.com/graphql-language-service-utils)\n\nUtilities to support the [GraphQL Language Service](packages/graphql-language-service#readme).\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis is an open source project, and we welcome contributions. Please see\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute.\n\n\n## Fielding Proposals!\n\nThe door is open for proposals for the new GraphiQL Plugin API, and other ideas on how to make the rest of the IDE ecosystem more performant, scaleable, interoperable and extensible.\nFeel free to open a PR to create a document in the `/proposals/` directory. \nEventually we hope to move these to a repo that serves this purpose.\n\n\n## Community\n\n- __Discord__ - Most discussion outside of github happens on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/eNuu9Cb)\n- __Twitter__ - [@GraphiQL](https://twitter.com/@GraphiQL) and [#GraphiQL](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GraphiQL)\n- __GitHub__ - Create feature requests and start discussions above\n'
