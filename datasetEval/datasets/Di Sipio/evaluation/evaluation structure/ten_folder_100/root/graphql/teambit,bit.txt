It\'s faster to build, easier to test, simpler to maintain and more fun to collaborate on. Bit turns modularity into a practical commodity, bringing component source-code management and dependency management together. It helps teams build better software faster together.\n\n*Bit is a collaborative open source project, actively developed and maintained by a venture-backed team and used by more teams and communities every day*.  \n\n## Contents  \n\n- [Examples](#examples)\n- [Getting started](https://bit.dev)\n- [Docs](https://docs.bit.dev)\n- [Workflow](#workflow)\n- [Bit in the wild](#bit-in-the-wild)\n  - [Bit monorepo](#bit-monorepo)\n  - [Bit across apps](#bit-across-apps)\n  - [Component design system](#component-design-system)\n- [Motivation](#motivation)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)  \n\n## Examples  \n\nBit is used to quickly share and reuse code from any project. Every component can be installed, developed and used in any other project. Popular use cases are [UI components](https://bit.dev/components?labels=ui%20components) and [React components](https://bit.dev/components?labels=react), [JavaScript functions](https://bit.dev/components?labels=utils) and more.  \n\nLearn: **[Build a Super-Modular Todo App with React and Bit Components](https://blog.bitsrc.io/build-a-super-modular-todo-app-with-react-and-bit-components-aa06bbac4084)**.\n\n### UI components\n\nShare components from UI libraries and projects, and use them to build new apps. [Discover components](https://bit.dev/components?labels=react) from the community, to add to your apps. Example:\n\n**React spinners**:  \n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://bit.dev/bondz/react-epic-spinners"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bit-docs/react-spinners-bit-ui-gif.gif"></a>\n</p>  \n\n[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bondz/react-epic-spinners) \xe2\x86\x92 [Components with Bit](https://bit.dev/bondz/react-epic-spinners).  \n\nOnce you choose a component, you can play with it in a live playground, save examples, and use npm/yarn to install it in your project.  \n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://bit.dev/davidhu2000/react-spinners/pacman-loader"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bit-docs/react-pacman-loader-ui-gif.gif"></a>\n</p>  \n\n\n### Plain JavaScript and NodeJS\n\nShare components from JavaScript libraries and projects, and use them to build new apps.   \n\n**Ramda functions**:  \n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://bit.dev/ramda/ramda"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bit-docs/ramda-functions-bit-gif2.gif"></a>\n</p>  \n\n[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ramda/ramda) \xe2\x86\x92 [Functions with Bit](https://bit.dev/ramda/ramda).\n\n## Workflow\n\nBit turns components into isolated and reusable building blocks you can run and develop from any other project in any context. It works in any given repository structure, without changing it at all, so the repository\xe2\x80\x99s structure will remain the same.  \n\n### Component isolation and sharing\n\nWhen running the `bit add` command Bit will isolate components in the existing project structure. Meaning, Bit will [track the components](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/add-and-isolate-components.html) and create a dependency graph for each of them. With this data, Bit creates an isolated environment for each component, which lets the component run and work in any other project. For example, components written in typescript can be used and developed in a project written in flow-typed.\n\nTo [tag a version]((https://docs.bit.dev/docs/tag-component-version.html)) for the components, use the `bit tag` command. At any point, you can use the `bit status` command to learn more.  \n\nThen, `bit export` them to a [remote collection](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/organizing-components.html) from which they can be installed in other projects. You can set up a collection on any server, or use [Bit\xe2\x80\x99s component hub](https://bit.dev). Here\xe2\x80\x99s a quick demo.\n\n**Exporting 256 Ramda components (functions) from the repository to Bit\xe2\x80\x99s hub in 2 minutes**:  \n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz0y2GTsSrU"><img width="460" height="300" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bit-docs/image-ramda-256-components.png"></a>\n</p>  \n\n### Component usage  \n\nOnce components are shared to Bit\xe2\x80\x99s hub (which isn\xe2\x80\x99t mandatory; Bit is distributed and you can [set up a collection](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/bit-on-the-server.html) on any server), you can use them in other projects in a number of methods:  \n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://bit.dev/davidhu2000/react-spinners/pacman-loader"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bit-docs/Install-compnent-npm-yarn-bit.png"></a>\n</p>\n\n* [Install components with NPM and Yarn](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/installing-components.html)\n* [Import components with Bit](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/sourcing-components.html)  \n\n#### Installing components with npm/yarn\n\nYou can install components shared to [Bit\xe2\x80\x99s hub](https://bit.dev/components) from Bit\xe2\x80\x99s [package registry](https://blog.bitsrc.io/introducing-bits-npm-package-registry-f4892de57b0c) via the NPM or Yarn clients. This means Bit can turn any repository and library into a multi-package monorepo almost instantly, without refactoring, and with advanced discoverability.\n\n#### Importing components with Bit\n\nYou can import components shared to [Bit\xe2\x80\x99s hub](https://bit.dev/components) using the `bit import` command. This will [source the component](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/sourcing-components.html) in your local project, so you can [continue to develop it](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/modifying-sourced-components.html) right from the consuming project. Since Bit will keep tracking the component, you can [update](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/update-dependencies.html) and [sync](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/merge-changes.html) changes from your project to Bit\xe2\x80\x99s hub (and if you wish, eject the component to become a package dependency) and to other projects.  \n\n### Distributed component development\n\nRelying on Bit\xe2\x80\x99s ability to [import component](#importing-components-with-bit) into any project, you can develop the same component from different projects at the same time.  \n\nThis creates a distributed workflow in which your team can collaborate and suggest new updates for each other\xe2\x80\x99s components, so that they can be extended over time. It also lets you control permissions for who can update which component, rather than being limited by access to the library from which the components were shared from.  \n\n### Extending Bit \n\nBit can be extended to play with the tools you work with, including [build and test environments](https://bit.dev/bit/envs) to test and compile your components. \n\nPre-made environments, which are also Bit components that can be imported into your project before tagging the components, save the overhead of configurations for each component. You can use the [example environments](https://bit.dev/bit/envs) in Bit\xe2\x80\x99s hub, or create your own. You can learn more about it [in the docs](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/building-components.html).\n\nUpdate: An extensive extension system is in the works and should become available within weeks. This will make the process of creating extensions effortless, and open new possibilities to integrate any tool or workflow into Bit\xe2\x80\x99s code-sharing workflow.\n\n## Bit in the wild\n\n### Bit monorepo\n\nAny repository or library containing components is already a Bit monorepo.  \n\nAdding Bit to the repository will not change its structure, source code or configurations. You won\xe2\x80\x99t need to refactor or create separate directories and configurations for every component.  \nInstead, you can use Bit to track and share the components from your library directly to Bit\xe2\x80\x99s hub. Then, they become available to install as individual NPM packages.   \n\nThis means that your React UI library + Bit will become a monorepo from which components can be individually discovered and installed, without changing the library. Component dependencies will be automatically defined by Bit, and build/test configurations will be [applied to all the components](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/building-components.html) using [Bit\xe2\x80\x99s environments](https://bit.dev/bit/envs). In addition, you will get discoverability for the components across your team, community or organization.\n\n#### Example:\n\n[Semantic UI library before Bit](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React)\n\n[Semantic UI React library with Bit](https://github.com/teambit/Semantic-UI-React/tree/addBit)\n\n[Semantic UI components in Bit\xe2\x80\x99s hub](https://bit.dev/semantic-org/semantic-ui-react)\n\n[Learn more: Bit with and without Lerna](https://blog.bitsrc.io/monorepo-architecture-simplified-with-bit-and-npm-b1354be62870).  \n\n### Bit across apps\n\nMany teams keep separate repositories for different parts of their codebase.  \n\nWhen the same code is needed in different places, effective code-sharing becomes the key to development velocity and the maintenance of your codebase over time.  \n\nBit makes this process more effective by:  \n\n- Eliminating the overhead around \xe2\x80\x9cpublishing\xe2\x80\x9d code directly from any repository.\n- Organizing and making these code units discoverable and manageable.\n- Creating a collaborative code-sharing workflow where everyone, given permissions, can make changes, suggest updates and stay in sync.  \n\nAs a result, you can share more code in less time and manage it at scale without having to \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d adoption or get lost in the overhead around the process.\n\n### Component design system\n\nBit is a quick and effective way to create a design system from your components.  \n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://bit.dev/components?labels=ui%20components"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bit-docs/Component-design-system-bit.png"></a>\n</p>\n\nYou can organize components for your team to share, view and try them hands-on in Bit\xe2\x80\x99s hub component playground, and use components directly your projects.  \n\nDevelopers, designers and other team members can share, view and work with components to build faster together. [Learn more](https://blog.bitsrc.io/building-a-consistent-ui-design-system-4481fb37470f).\n\n## Motivation  \n\n[Modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) has always been a key principle in software development.  \n\nIn today\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem, the tools and technologies we use across our stack are built for modularity, from React/Vue/Angular/Web components in the front to GraphQL and NodeJS in the back, and even serverless functions. \n\nLooking into the future, smaller components are the [composable building blocks](https://addyosmani.com/first) of our software applications. Instead of having to reinvent the wheel every time or having to work hard and long to share and reuse them, we should make it easy -and even fun- to discover, share and build with components. To that purpose, Bit was created.  \n\nAnd, it\xe2\x80\x99s only the beginning.\n\n## Supported Languages\n\nBit\'s design is language agnostic. Still, as of today, it requires language-specific drivers for language-sensitive features (binding etc). We released Bit\xe2\x80\x99s driver for JavaScript, and will be releasing more drivers in the future. You are also welcome to add your own.\n\n- [bit-javascript](https://github.com/teambit/bit-javascript).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small.
