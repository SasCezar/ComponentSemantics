Besides that, Pro customers get email support and an opportunity to support graphql-ruby\'s development!\n\n## Goals\n\n- Implement the GraphQL spec & support a Relay front end\n- Provide idiomatic, plain-Ruby API with similarities to reference implementation where possible\n- Support Ruby on Rails and Relay\n\n## Getting Involved\n\n- __Say hi & ask questions__ in the [#ruby channel on Slack](https://graphql-slack.herokuapp.com/) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rmosolgo)!\n- __Report bugs__ by posting a description, full stack trace, and all relevant code in a  [GitHub issue](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/issues).\n- __Start hacking__ with the [Development guide](https://graphql-ruby.org/development).\n'
