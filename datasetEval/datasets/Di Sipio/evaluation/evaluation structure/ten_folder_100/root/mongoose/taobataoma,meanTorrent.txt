You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.\n* AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).\n* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.\n\n## Prerequisites\nMake sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:\n* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.\n* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.\n* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), at least version 3.4 is required, and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).\n* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -g bower\n```\n\n## Downloading meanTorrent\nThere are several ways you can get the meanTorrent boilerplate:\n\n### Cloning The GitHub Repository\nThe recommended way to get meanTorrent is to use git to directly clone the meanTorrent repository:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/taobataoma/meanTorrent.git\n```\n\nThis will clone the latest version of the meanTorrent repository to a **meanTorrent** folder.\n\n### Downloading The Repository Zip File\nAnother way to use the MEAN.JS boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/taobataoma/meanTorrent/archive/master.zip). You can also do this using the `wget` command:\n\n```bash\n$ wget https://github.com/taobataoma/meanTorrent/archive/master.zip -O meanTorrent.zip; unzip meanTorrent.zip; rm meanTorrent.zip\n```\n\nDon't forget to rename **meanTorrent-master** after your project name.\n\n## Quick Install\nOnce you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your meanTorrent application.\n\nThe boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a `package.json` and `bower.json` files that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.\n\nTo install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\nThis command does a few things:\n* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.\n* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.\n* When the npm packages install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application\n* To update these packages later on, just run `npm update`\n\nIf install process show error info below:\n\n`../node-icu-charset-detector.cpp:7:28: fatal error: unicode/ucsdet.h: No such file or directory`\n\nthen run this command to install libicu manual\n\n`apt-get install libicu-dev` OR `yum install libicu-devel`\n\n## Running Your Application\n\nRun your application using npm:\n\n```bash\n$ npm start\n```\n\nYour application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\n\nThat's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.\nIf you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.\n\nExplore `config/env/development.js` for development environment configuration options.\n\n### Running in Production mode\nTo run your application with *production* environment configuration:\n\n```bash\n$ npm run start:prod\n```\n\nExplore `config/env/production.js` for production environment configuration options.\n\n### Running with TLS (SSL)\nApplication will start by default with secure configuration (SSL mode) turned on and listen on port 8443.\nTo run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ npm run generate-ssl-certs\n```\n\nWindows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority).\nAfter you've generated the key and certificate, place them in the *config/sslcerts* folder.\n\nFinally, execute prod task `npm run start:prod`\n* enable/disable SSL mode in production environment change the `secure` option in `config/env/production.js`\n\n## Getting Started With meanTorrent\nBefore you to start the meanTorrent application, Please explore `config/env/torrent.js` for many environment configuration options, you can change all  configuration items of you Caring,\nsuch as:\n\n```javascript\n    announce: {\n      url: 'http://mean.im/announce',\n      announcePrefix: '[mean.im].',\n      admin: 'admin@mean.im',\n      baseUrl: 'http://mean.im',\n      clientBlackListUrl: '/about/black'\n    },\n```\nmeanTorrent tracker is private, please set the `announce.url` to your server url, then when user to upload torrent file, It will autocheck the torrent announce url whether matching as `announce.url`.\n\n```javascript\n    tmdbConfig: {\n      //please change it to your api key from themoviedb.org\n      key: 'key from themoviedb.org',\n    },\n```\n\nBecause meanTorrent autoload the movie info from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org), so please to register yourself key and replace it to `tmdbConfig.key`.\n\n```javascript\n    language: [\n      {name: 'en', index: 0, class: 'flag-icon-gb', title: 'English'},\n      {name: 'zh', index: 1, class: 'flag-icon-cn', title: '\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87'}\n    ],\n```\nMultilingual support, if you add a new translate string file, please add configuration here.
