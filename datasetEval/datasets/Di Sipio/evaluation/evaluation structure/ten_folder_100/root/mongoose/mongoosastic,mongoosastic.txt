Thanks!\n\n\n# Mongoosastic\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mongoosastic/mongoosastic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mongoosastic/mongoosastic)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/mongoosastic.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoosastic)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/mongoosastic/mongoosastic/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/mongoosastic/mongoosastic?branch=master)\n[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/mongoosastic.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoosastic)\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/mongoosastic/mongoosastic?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\n\nMongoosastic is a [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) plugin that can automatically index your models into [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).\n\n\n## Getting started\n\n1. Install the package\n\n```bash\nnpm install -S mongoosastic\n```\n\n2. Setup your mongoose model to use the plugin\n\n```javascript\nvar mongoose     = require(\'mongoose\')\n  , mongoosastic = require(\'mongoosastic\')\n  , Schema       = mongoose.Schema\n\nvar User = new Schema({\n    name: String\n  , email: String\n  , city: String\n})\n\nUser.plugin(mongoosastic)\n```\n\n3. Query your Elasticsearch with the `search()` method (added by the plugin)\n\n```javascript\nUser.search({\n  query_string: {\n    query: "john"\n  }\n}, function(err, results) {\n  // results here\n});\n\n```\n\n*NOTE*: You can also query Elasticsearch with any other method. Example: \n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:9200/users/user/_search\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n[View docs](docs/README.md)\n\n\n\n'
