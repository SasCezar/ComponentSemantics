Make sure you run npm install on your host machine so that code linting and everything works fine.\n\n```sh\nnpm i\ncp .env.example .env\n```\n\nStart the services\n\n```sh\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nView the logs\n\n```sh\ndocker-compose logs -f\n```\n\nIn case you install a npm module while developing, it should also be installed within docker container, to do this first install the module you want with simple `npm i module name`, then run it within docker container\n\n```sh\ndocker-compose exec node npm i\n```\n\nIf you make any changes to the file, nodemon should automatically pick up and restart within docker (you can see this in the logs)\n\nTo run tests\n\n```sh\ndocker-compose exec -e MONGODB_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017/noobjs_test node npm test\n```\n\nNote that we are overriding the environment variable set in `.env` file because we don't want our data erased by the tests.\n\nNote: The difference between exec and run is that, exec executes the command within the running container and run will spin up a new container to run that command. So if you want to run only the tests without docker-compose up, you may do so by running `docker-compose run -e MONGODB_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017/my_app_test node npm test`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
