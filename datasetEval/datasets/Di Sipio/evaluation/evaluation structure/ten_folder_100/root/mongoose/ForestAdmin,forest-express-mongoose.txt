Set advanced filters based on fields and\nrelationships to handle complex search use cases.\n\n<img src="https://www.forestadmin.com/public/img/illustrations-dev/screens/search.jpg" alt="Search and Filters">\n\n### Sorting & Pagination\nSorting and pagination features are natively handled by the Admin API. We\'re\ncontinuously optimizing how queries are run in order to display results faster\nand reduce the load of your servers.\n\n<img src="https://www.forestadmin.com/public/img/illustrations-dev/screens/sorting.jpg" alt="Sorting and Pagination">\n\n### Custom action\nA custom action is a button which allows you to trigger an API call to execute\na custom logic. With virtually no limitations, you can extend the way you\nmanipulate data and trigger actions (e.g. refund a customer, apply a coupon,\nban a user, etc.)\n\n<img src="https://www.forestadmin.com/public/img/illustrations-dev/screens/custom.jpg" alt="Sorting and Pagination">\n\n### Export\nSometimes you need to export your data to a good old fashioned CSV. Yes, we\nknow this can come in handy sometimes :-)\n\n<img src="https://www.forestadmin.com/public/img/illustrations-dev/screens/export.jpg" alt="Export">\n\n### Segments\nGet in app access to a subset of your application data by doing a basic search\nor typing an SQL query or implementing an API route.\n\n<img src="https://www.forestadmin.com/public/img/illustrations-dev/screens/segments.jpg" alt="Segments">\n\n### Dashboards\nForest Admin is able to tap into your actual data to chart out your metrics\nusing a simple UI panel, a SQL query or a custom API call.\n\n<img src="https://www.forestadmin.com/public/img/illustrations-dev/screens/dashboard.jpg" alt="Dashboard">\n\n### WYSIWYG\nThe WYSIWYG interface saves you a tremendous amount of frontend development\ntime using drag\'n\'drop as well as advanced widgets to build customizable views.\n\n<img src="https://www.forestadmin.com/public/img/illustrations-dev/screens/wysiwyg.jpg" alt="WYSIWYG">\n\n### Custom HTML/JS/CSS\nCode your own views using JS, HTML, and CSS to display your application data in\na more appropriate way (e.g. Kanban, Map, Calendar, Gallery, etc.).\n\n<img src="https://www.forestadmin.com/public/img/illustrations-dev/screens/customhtml.jpg" alt="Custom views">\n\n### Team-based permissions\nWithout any lines of code, manage directly from the UI who has access or can\nact on which data using a team-based permission system.\n\n<img src="https://www.forestadmin.com/public/img/illustrations-dev/screens/team.jpg" alt="Team based permissions">\n\n### Third-party integrations\nLeverage data from third-party services by reconciling it with your\napplication\xe2\x80\x99s data and providing it directly to your Admin Panel. All your\nactions can be performed at the same place, bringing additional intelligence to\nyour Admin Panel and ensuring consistency.\n\n<img src="https://www.forestadmin.com/public/img/illustrations-dev/screens/integration.jpg" alt="Third-party integrations">\n\n### Notes & Comments\nAssign your teammates to specific tasks, leave a note or simply comment a\nrecord, thereby simplifying collaboration all across your organization.\n\n<img src="https://www.forestadmin.com/public/img/illustrations-dev/screens/notes.jpg" alt="Notes and Comments">\n\n### Activity logs\nMonitor each action executed and follow the trail of modification on any data\nwith an extensive activity log system.\n\n<img src="https://www.forestadmin.com/public/img/illustrations-dev/screens/activity.jpg" alt="Activity logs">\n\n## How it works\n\nThe Forest Admin NPM package (aka Forest Liana) introspects all your data model\nand dynamically generates the Admin API hosted on your servers.
