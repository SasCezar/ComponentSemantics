[agent.exe -t filename api secretkey]\n-m --Run All Known Scan Types together .\n```\n### Server Web App (must be like this  : http://host/0xsp/ )\n\n[<img src="https://secploit.com/static/0xsp/web.png">]()\n\n1. make sure to have at least `php 5.6 or above` \n2. requires  `mysql 5.6` \n3. make sure to add Web application on root path `/` with folder name  `0xsp` as  [ http://localhost/0xsp/]  , `Agent` will not connect to it in case not configured correctly . the `agent` will connect only as following case : \n```\n./agent {SCAN OPTION} -o localhost -x secretkey\n```\n\n\n### Examples With WebApi  \n\n```\n./agent -c -o localhost -x 0xsp { enumerate for CRON Tasks and Transfer results into Web Api} \n./agent -e -o localhost -x 0xsp { intelligent Exploits Detector }\n./agent -c -e localhost -x 0sxp { will run two scans together and send found results directly }\n./agent -m -o 10.10.13.1 -x 0xsp { RUN all Scans together and export it to Web API} \n```\n\n### Examples Without WebApi\n\n```\n./agent -c -k -p { this will run 3 scans at the same time with out sending results into Web Api }\n```\n\n### Agent Features \n\n1. High performance , stability , Output results Generated while executing no delays \n2. Ability to execute most of functions with intelligent techniques . \n3. results are being sent to Quick Web API\n4. Exception Handling . \n5. inbuilt Json Data set for publicly disclosed Exploits . \n6. Fast As Mongoose \n\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lG3HS7a9sVc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG3HS7a9sVc)\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YRrnXPDVZlg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRrnXPDVZlg)\n'
