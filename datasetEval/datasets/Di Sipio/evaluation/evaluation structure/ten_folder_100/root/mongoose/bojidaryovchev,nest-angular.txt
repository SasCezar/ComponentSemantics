b"# nest-angular\n\nA fullstack JavaScript project, using technologies from the modern stack, such as:\n\n* [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) - a JS backend framework providing architecture out of the box with a syntax similar to Angular\n* [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) - a JS frontend framework created by Google\n* [Angular Universal](https://github.com/angular/universal) - Angular Server Side Rendering - prerendered crawlable pages\n* [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) - reactive extensions for JavaScript\n* [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) - the ultimate JS bundler - used for the server code since Angular has it under the hood\n* [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) - a NoSQL database\n* [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) - MongoDB object modeling designed to work in an asynchronous environment\n* [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) - superset of JS which compiles to JS, providing compile-time type checking\n* [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) - a popular library used to implement JavaScript authentication\n* [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) - a JavaScript json web tokens implementation by auth0\n\n## Running the project\n\nThese instructions should be sufficient for one to get the project going on their local machine\n\n### Cloning the github repository\n\nTo clone the project, run\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/bojidaryovchev/nest-angular.git\n```\n\n### Installing the dependencies\n\nTo install the dependencies after you've cloned the project, go to its root folder and run\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Building the Angular application\n\nBefore you start the server, you need to build the Angular application. To do so, run\n```\nnpm run build:universal\n```\n\n### Starting the server\n\nOnce you have the Angular app built, you can start the server by running\n```\nnpm run watch:server\n```\nNotice that the server uses MongoDB so we need to have a MongoDB instance running so the server can connect to it\n\n### Alternative commands\n\nIf you need to work on the frontend and backend parts at the same time, you can run\n```\nnpm run watch\n```\nThen, you can go to the Angular dev server at port 4200 and test server requests (to port 1337), we got a proxy to the backend\n\nIf you only need to work on the frontend, you can run\n```\nnpm run watch:client\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you only need to work on the backend, you can run\n```\nnpm run watch:server\n```\nKeeping in mind that you need to have the Angular app built and a mongodb connection established\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Getting GraphQL to work\n\nCurrently there are issues with several packages so even though we have GraphQL implemented, it stays commented out because it doesn't work.. Here are the instructions to make it work:\n\n- Download https://www.dropbox.com/s/7bvht9thbmwt1e5/fixed-apollo-modules.rar?dl=0 - those are the apollo-angular and apollo-angular-link-http modules compiled in commonjs - then go in your node_modules folder and replace your apollo-angular and apollo-angular-link-http modules with these ones\n- Download https://www.dropbox.com/s/n0vwfvdmn7wtkj8/fixed-nest-modules.rar?dl=0 - this is the fixed @nestjs/graphql module - there was an error when in combination with Angular Universal which is now fixed - then replace your @nestjs/graphql module with this one\n- Open node_modules/@types/ws/index.d.ts and find net.AddressInfo - you will see a type definition of a function:\n```address(): net.AddressInfo | string``` - change it to ```address(): string```\n\nNow, you can go ahead and uncomment the GraphqlModules on both client/server side and it works decently, I am using it in another project which is a clone of this one and everything works..\n\n### Use Social login\n\nModify with your application credentials:\n\n- src/server/modules/auth/config/facebook-config.ts \n- src/server/modules/auth/config/google-config.ts\n- src/server/modules/auth/config/twitter-config.ts\n\nTo use it in mobile application with Facebook-token integration (Facebook App), use /api/auth/facebook/token endpoint.\n"
