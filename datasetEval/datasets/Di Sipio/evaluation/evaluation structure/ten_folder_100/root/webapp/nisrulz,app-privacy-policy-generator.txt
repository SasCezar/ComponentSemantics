If you want contribute a new 3rd party service for the section then open a Pull Request which simply adds a new JSON item to the JSON Array in [`public/js/thirdpartyservices.js`](public/js/thirdpartyservices.js)\n\nThe format is very simple and you only need to provide fill the fields as follows:\n```\n[\n  ..\n  }, // Donot forget to add a \',\' before adding your new item in the array\n  {\n    name: \'Google Play Services\',\n    model: \'gps\', // this is stores the name of the model\n    gps: true, // this stores the state of the model, notice the key is the same as the model above. It is required by code.\n    logo: \'images/gps.png\',\n    link: {\n      privacy: \'https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/\',\n      terms: \'\'\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n> Note: You also will have to drop the logo image into the [`public/images/`](public/images/) folder. Make sure the logo is 160\xe2\x80\x86\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x86160 in size.\n\n# Pull Requests\nI welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:\n  1. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.\n  1. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)\n  1. Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.\n  1.
