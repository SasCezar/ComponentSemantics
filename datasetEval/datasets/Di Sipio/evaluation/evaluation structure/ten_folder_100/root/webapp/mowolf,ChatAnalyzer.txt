You can turn off your internet before loading your data file if you are particularly concerned. You can also take a look at the source code and give it an audit.\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease open a [new Github Issue](https://github.com/mowolf/ChatAnalyzer/issues/new) if you find any issues or have suggestions/improvements for the project.\n\nPlease also supply your data format (e.g. `[07.09.17, 6:44:16 PM] NAME: message`) and Language/Region setting of our phone if you are having a specific problem with data not loading correctly.\n\n## Have a great idea for a new graph?\n\nHead over to [planned features](https://github.com/mowolf/ChatAnalyzer/labels/enhancement) and add your idea if it\'s missing!\n\n## Wanna help making this better?\n\nCheers! You are very welcome! Just submit a pull request. The goal of this tool is to automize the parsing as much as possible.\n\n### Add your language identifier for audio/video/pictures\n\nPlease see the header of `main.js`. There you can add your identifiers.\n\n### Markov Chain\n\nTo generate text that sounds like you check here: https://github.com/mowolf/markov_chain_js/tree/master\n\n### How the data is parsed & how you can build on that\n\nThe chat data is parsed via regex and splitted into it\'s parts. There are two variables that hold the data.\n\n*`structArray`:*\nFormatted line data in the form of a struct with the keys: name date time message\n\n- `name`: "Name Surname"\n- `date`: "YYYY-MM-DD"\n- `time`: "HH:MM:SS"\n- `message`: text\n\neach key represents an array, the index represents the line number\ne.g. structArray.date[0] is the date of the first line\n\n*`userStruct`:*\n\nArray of structs with the keys:\n\n- `name`: "Name Surname"\n- `date`: "YYYY-MM-DD"\n- `time`: "HH:MM:SS"\n- `message`: text\n\nFor every person there is one struct, same format as above, the `index` represents messageNumber of `name`.\n'
