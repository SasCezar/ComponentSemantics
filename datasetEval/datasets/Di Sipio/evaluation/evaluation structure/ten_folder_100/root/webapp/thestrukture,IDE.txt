b"# Strukture IDE Beta II\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thestrukture/IDE.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thestrukture/IDE)\n[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/thestrukture/IDE/api?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/thestrukture/IDE/api)\n[![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/d46b0bfb51e827632710/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/thestrukture/IDE/test_coverage)\n[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/d46b0bfb51e827632710/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/thestrukture/IDE/maintainability)\n\nGo lang IDE server. Built with [GopherSauce](http://gophersauce.com)\n\n## About project\nThe strukture is an open source IDE. It is designed to build web applications, with the organizational help of [GopherSauce](http://gophersauce.com). The IDE runs as a server and is accessed via web browser. Being a web server, the IDE is accessible from any device on your network.Compared to Microsoft VS Code and Eclipse CHE, this IDE is very minimalistic. It features :\n- Web application resource management.\n- Autocomplete between different files.\n- Syntax correction.\n- Server process management.\n- Basic terminal via stateless HTTP.\n- Line tags in relation to failed build logs.\n- Project build scripts.\n- View web application output.\n- Build docker images (Must have docker running on host) . \n\n## Requirements\n- Go v1.7+.\n- [GopherSauce](http://gophersauce.com) if using `makefile`.\n\n## Install\n\n\t\t$ go get github.com/thestrukture/IDE\n\n#### How to run\n\n\t\t$ IDE\n\n#### Launch with GUI (Electron View)\n\n###### Requires NodeJS\n- NodeJS [Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\n\nChange to the ui directory within the root of this package. (Moved ui files to build package as go)\n\n\t\t$ cd ui/\n\t\t$ npm install\n\t\t$ IDE --headless & npm start\n\nTake note of the pid ID to stop server process. Once your server is up feel free to use `npm start` directly.\n\n### IE Fix\nIf build commands keep returning the same message, push the `F12` key down to open developer tools and try building again.\n\t\n## Access\n\nVisit [localhost:8884/index](http://localhost:8884/index).
