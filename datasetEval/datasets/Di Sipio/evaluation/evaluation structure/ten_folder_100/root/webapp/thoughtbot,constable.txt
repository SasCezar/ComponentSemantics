b'# Constable\n\n**Constable is part of the [thoughtbot Elixir family][elixir-phoenix] of projects.**\n\nConstable is a Phoenix app for posting announcements and having discussions.\nTo learn more about Phoenix, check out [Programming Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix/programming-phoenix)\n\n## Starting the Console\n\nUse `bin/console` to start the console. Use `bin/console staging|production` to\nstart the console in staging or production.\n\n## Reactivating Users\n\nUsers are deactivated if they leave thoughtbot. Sometimes someone with the same\nfirst name joins thoughtbot later and inherits the deactivated email so we need\nto reactivate the email.\n\n* Run `bin/console production`\n* Run `Constable.User.reactivate("person@thoughtbot.com")`\n\n## Developing the Application\n\nTo set up your development environment, there are a few steps you\'ll need to\nfollow.\n\n### Install Required Dependencies\n\nYou need to have Erlang, Elixir, Node and ChromeDriver installed. This section\ndescribes the easiest way to do that.\n\nIf you\'re on OS X and using Homebrew, run `brew install node` to get nodejs.\n\nOnce node is installed, run `npm -g install chromedriver`.\n\nFinally, install the [asdf] package manager, which will read the\n`.tool-versions` file from the repo to install the correct versions of Erlang\nand Elixir. Downloading and installing Erlang might take a while, so be patient\non first run. You should be able to run `asdf install` from the project directly\nto install the required packages.\n\n[asdf]: https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf\n\n### Configure Your Local Environment\n\nRun:\n\n  ```sh\n  # Will grab all Elixir and NPM dependencies and then setup the database\n  $ bin/setup\n  ```\n\n### Starting the Phoenix Server\n\nOnce all the dependencies have been installed, you can start the Phoenix\nserver with:\n\n  ```sh\n  $ mix phx.server\n  ```\n\n## Email Templates\n\nYou can edit the email contents from `web/templates/email`.\n\nYou can preview templates by going to `localhost:4000/emails/#{template_name}`.\nYou can find a list of templates in the `EmailPreviewController`.\n\n## Viewing Sent Emails\n\nYou can view sent emails in development by going to `localhost:4000/sent_emails`\n\n## Testing\n\nRun `mix test`\n\n## Static Analysis\n\nRun `mix dialyzer` to run the analysis. The lookup table will be created by this\nprocess. If your dependencies or your elixir version change, delete\n`.dialyzer.plt` and run `mix dialyzer.plt` to rebuild it.\n\nThere are still a lot of warnings that are not fixable, but occasionally some\nreal errors are found by dialyzer\n\n## Deployment\n\n1. If you have not run `bin/setup` yet, run it to add the correct git remotes.\n2. Run `bin/deploy (staging|production)`\n\n## Review Apps\n\nConstable is setup with support for [Heroku Review Apps].\n\nGoogle enforces a white list of OAuth redirect URLs, so for review apps we\nredirect the OAuth flow through the [Constable oauth redirector] which then\nredirects back to the correct review app. This is configured with the\n`OAUTH_REDIRECT_OVERRIDE` environment variable.\n\n[Heroku Review Apps]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration-review-apps\n[Constable oauth redirector]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/constable-oauth-redirector\n\n## License\n\nConstable is Copyright (c) 2015-2016 Blake Williams, Paul Smith, and thoughtbot,\ninc.
