Without this knowledge the doctor could misdiagnose my illness and impede my path to regain my health.\nFor these reasons, and because the German Insurances and Doctor Software Supplier are unable to release their own solution, I have decided to make OwnHealthRecord.\n\n## When will it be ready?\nI have already made a running proof of concept web app with the basic functionality, however, it is not ready for stable use and is more of an alpha release. It is constantly being changed and updated with new features so there is not set release date.\n\n\n# Requirements\n* LAMP Stack\n* PHP 7\n* A MySQL/MariaDB database\n\nThe web app is using PHP and MySQL, because its the most used environment you will find on nearly every server. This can be used on a root server as well as on a SharedHost or VPS.\n\n## SQLite?\nFor the time being I have no capacity to implement it as a separate function. If you want to contribute to it, you are welcome to open an issue and discuss it.\n\n# How to use\n# How do I use this?\nUpload the files or clone the repo to your document root / html folder on your server, \nThen, create a new MySQL database on via PHPMyAdmin and import the database-structure.sql file to your MySQL/MariaDB database. This will contain the tables medicalrecords, doctors, medicine and user.\n\n\n### DB Connection\nGo to the includes folder in your OwnHealthRecord directory and open psl-config.php, Once open, type in your database login credentials. In a future version this step will be replaced by a installer.\n\n**Important: The Secret Key must be changed by yourself, this is important to encrypt the data with AES_Encrypt** \n\n## Current Functionality\n* medical-Record.php - here you can write down your personal medical record and have it display what is saved in the database.\n\n\n* doctors-list.php - here you can write and see all your doctors contact information as well the treatment time, so you will not forget when you were there and how long the appointement was. \n    \n    Example:\n    \n    Treatment period 01.2018 - 10.2018.\n\n\n  \n* medicine.php - here you can add your medication, dose, period of usage, a link to a website with information about the medicine you are taking and additional warnings from your doctor.\n\n\n## Screenshot\n![](images/ownhealthrecord_medrecord%20v0.3.png)\nScreenshot from V0.3\n\n![](images/ownhealthrecord_medrecord_dashboard.png)\nScreenshot from V0.1\n\n## Attention - Safety - No guarantee\nThis software is built by me, there is **no guarantee** that everything will work properly. It is made for selfhosting, so you must take care of the server\'s security and protection of the data. For the login always use an HTTPS connection with a valid SSL certificate. The database entries are encrypted, but this doesn\'t guarantee the data\'s security. The password is hashed and salted for improved security.\n\n## Your own server - Your own security\nThis application has to run on a secure environment, if you want to use it for production. So if you store your medical record on your own server, you must take care of your own security to keep it running secure.\n\n\nFor this reason, I have collected some links which provide guides to securing your server:\n\n* https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/7-security-measures-to-protect-your-servers\n* <a href="https://www.rackaid.com/blog/server-security-tips/" target="_blank">79 Server Security Tips for You to Secure Your Server</a>\n* <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server/" target="_blank">How to Secure Your Server</a>\n* <a href="https://medium.com/viithiisys/10-steps-to-secure-linux-server-for-production-environment-a135109a57c5" target="_blank">10 steps to secure Linux Server for Production Environment</a>\n\n\n## License\n\nThe Application is Open Source and can be used for private/individual purposes for free.
