b'# Tasks\n\nTasks is a simplistic Go webapp to manage tasks, I built this tool to manage tasks which I wanted to do, there are many good kanban style boards, but I felt they were a bit too heavyweight for my taste. Also I wanted to learn the Go webapp development.\n\nHow to use?\n==================\nVia script: `bash install.sh`\n\nThis will generate the binary and set up the database. If you want, you can copy the binary and the public folder into a folder of your choice.\n\nManually:\n\n1. `go get github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks`\n1. change dir to the respective folder and create the db file: `cat schema.sql | sqlite3 tasks.db`\n1. run `go build`\n1. `./Tasks`\n1. open [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)\n\nYou can change the port in the [config](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks/blob/master/config.json) file\n\n## Features\n\n1. Add, update, delete task.\n2. Search tasks, the query is highlighted in the search results page.\n3. Github flavoured markdown, which enables us for using a task list, advanced syntax highlighting and much more.\n4. Supports file upload, randomizes the file name, stores the user given filename in a db and works on the randomized file name for security reasons.\n5. Priorities are assigned, High = 3, medium = 2 and low = 1, sorting is done on priority descending and created date ascending.\n6. Categories are supported, you can add tasks to different categories. \n1. Ability to hide a task from the timeline.\n1. For a task list, shows 6 out of 8 tasks completed.\n1. Single click install, just run the install.sh file.\n\n\n##### Book\nI am learning writing webapps with Go as I build this application, I took to writing an introductory book about [building webapps in Go](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/web-dev-golang-anti-textbook) because I faced a lot of problems while learning how to write webapps in Go, it, the book strives to teach by practical examples. You are welcome to contribute to the book.\n\n# Screenshots\nThe Home Page\n\n![Home Page](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks/blob/master/screenshots/FrontEnd.png)\n\nAdd Task dialog\n\n![Add Task](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks/blob/master/screenshots/FrontEnd-Add%20task.png)\n\nNavigation drawer\n\n![Navigation Drawer](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks/blob/master/screenshots/FrontEnd%20Navigation%20Drawer.png)\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Suraj Patil\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
