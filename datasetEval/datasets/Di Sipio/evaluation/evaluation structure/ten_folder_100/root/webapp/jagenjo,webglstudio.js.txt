You can edit scenes and materials, design effects and shaders, code behaviours, and share your work - all within a browser using standard web technologies.\r\n\r\nSome important WebGLStudio.js features:\r\n\r\n * A full 3D graphics engine ([LiteScene.js](https://github.com/jagenjo/litescene.js)) that supports multiple lights, shadowmaps, realtime reflections, custom materials, postFX, skinning, animation, and much more.\r\n * An easily extended, component-based system for controlling the rendering pipeline and interaction event hooks \r\n * An easy to use, what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) editor that provides a single interface for all coding, graph compositing and timeline features.\r\n * A graph editor for controlling behaviours and post-processing effects.\r\n * Supports the [LiteFileSystem.js](https://github.com/jagenjo/litefilesystem.js), a virtual file system that allows drag-and-drop storage of resources on the web, with configurable quotas, users and shared folders.\r\n * Export and share your work by sending a single link.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit http://webglstudio.org\r\n\r\n![Interface](press/images/interface.jpg "Interface")\r\n\r\nFeatures missing:\r\n* Mesh editing, you cannot select faces and move them\r\n* Support for FBX, it has some sort of support but not fully functional\r\n* Physics\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n----------\r\n\r\nTo install WebGLStudio.js, copy the editor files to your server, then install [LiteFileSystem.js](https://github.com/jagenjo/litefilesystem.js) into a `fileserver/` folder within the `editor/` directory. \r\nLiteFileSystem is a library that handles remote file storage. For more information, see the `/INSTALL.md` file and the [LiteFileSystem.js](https://github.com/jagenjo/litefilesystem.js) documentation.\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n--------\r\n\r\nSend all feedback to javi.agenjo@gmail.com\r\n'
