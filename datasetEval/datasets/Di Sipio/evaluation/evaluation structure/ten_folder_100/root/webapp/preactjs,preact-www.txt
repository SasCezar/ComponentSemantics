b'# Preact Documentation Website\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/preactjs/preact-www.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/preactjs/preact-www)\n[![Preact Slack Community](https://preact-slack.now.sh/badge.svg)](https://preact-slack.now.sh)\n\n\nBuilt with [preact-cli](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli)\n\n> :rocket: `master` is automatically deployed to [preactjs.com](https://preactjs.com)\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Application Structure\n\nThis website is built as a [prerendered static app](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web#static-rendering), following the [Application Shell pattern](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell).\n\n\n#### Content\n\nContent is fetched and rendered on the fly from Markdown documents located in `content/`, similar to how Jekyll works.\nDocuments can contain optional YAML FrontMatter for specifying page metadata or layout information.\nOnce fetched, content is parsed using [marked] and rendered to VDOM via [preact-markup].\n\n#### Custom Elements\n\nSince [preact] is used to render the Markdown content, HTML contained in a document reference any of the Components listed in `src/components/widget.js` as Custom Elements, useful for dynamic content:\n\n```md\n## Example Page\n\n<!-- Jumbotron and Logo are actually Preact components! -->\n<jumbotron>\n    <h1><logo text>Preact</logo></h1>\n</jumbotron>\n```\n\n#### Navigation\n\nCurrently, the navigation menu and route handling is controlled by `src/config.json`.\nThis is likely to change, but in the meantime it means any new pages must be linked from the `"nav"` section of the config.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Local Development\n\n### Clone & Install Dependencies\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/preactjs/preact-www.git\ncd preact-www\n\nnpm install\n```\n\n\n## Development Workflow\n\n**To start a live-reload development server:**\n\n```sh\nPORT=8080 npm run dev\n```\n\n> Any time you make changes within the `src` directory, it will rebuild and even refresh your browser.\n\n\n**Generate a production build in `./build`:**\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\n\n---\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n\n[marked]: https://github.com/chjj/marked\n[preact]: https://github.com/preactjs/preact\n[preact-markup]: https://github.com/developit/preact-markup\n'
