b"# vimtex\n\nvimtex is a [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) plugin that provides support for writing\nLaTeX documents. It is based on\n[LaTeX-Box](https://github.com/LaTeX-Box-Team/LaTeX-Box) and it shares a\nsimilar goal: to provide a simple and lightweight LaTeX plugin. It has been\nrewritten from scratch to provide a more modern and modular code base. See\n[here](#alternatives) for some more comments on the difference between vimtex\nand other LaTeX plugins for Vim.\n\n![Build Status](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)\n[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=5N4MFVXN7U8NW)\n\n## Table of contents\n\n  * [Installation](#installation)\n  * [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n  * [Features](#features)\n  * [Other relevant plugins](#other-relevant-plugins)\n  * [Alternatives](#alternatives)\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), then add the\nfollowing line to your `vimrc` file:\n\n```vim\nPlug 'lervag/vimtex'\n```\n\nOr use some other plugin manager:\n- [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)\n- [neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)\n- [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)\n\nIf you use the new package feature in Vim, please note the following:\n- Make sure to read and understand the package feature: `:help package`!\n- Use the `/pack/foo/start` subdirectory to make sure the filetype plugin is automatically loaded for the `tex` filetypes.\n- Helptags are not generated automatically. Run `:helptags` to generate them.\n- Please note that by default Vim puts custom `/start/` plugin directories at the end of the `&runtimepath`. This means the built in filetype plugin is loaded, which prevents Vimtex from loading. See [#1413](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/1413) for two suggested solutions to this. To see which scripts are loaded and in which order, use `:scriptnames`.\n- For more information on how to use the Vim native package solution, see [here](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/9522/what-is-the-vim8-package-feature-and-how-should-i-use-it) and [here](https://shapeshed.com/vim-packages/).\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThe following is a simple guide for how to use vimtex. It only displays the\nmost basic features. Users are _strongly_ encouraged to read or at least skim\nthrough the documentation to learn about the different features and\npossibilities provided by vimtex (see [`:h vimtex`](doc/vimtex.txt)).\n\nNote: Vimtex supports neovim; see the [related wiki\nsection](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/wiki/introduction#neovim) or `:h\nvimtex-faq-neovim`.\n\n![Quick start gif](media/quick_start.gif?raw=true)\n\n## Features\n\nBelow is a list of features offered by vimtex.  The features are accessible as\nboth commands and mappings.  The mappings generally start with\n`<localleader>l`, but if desired one can disable default mappings to define\ncustom mappings.  All features are enabled by default, but each feature may be\ndisabled if desired.\n\n- Document compilation with\n  [latexmk](http://users.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/),\n  [latexrun](https://github.com/aclements/latexrun),\n  [tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io), or\n  [arara](https://github.com/cereda/arara)\n- LaTeX log parsing for quickfix entries using\n  - internal method\n  - [pplatex](https://github.com/stefanhepp/pplatex)\n- Compilation of selected part of document\n- Support for several PDF viewers with forward search\n  - [MuPDF](http://www.mupdf.com/)\n  - [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/)\n  - [qpdfview](https://launchpad.net/qpdfview)\n  - [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/)\n  - [SumatraPDF](http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html)\n  - [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/)\n  - Other viewers are supported through a general interface\n- Completion of\n  - citations\n  - labels\n  - commands\n  - file names for figures, input/include, includepdf, includestandalone\n  - glossary entries\n  - package and documentclass names based on available `.sty` and `.cls` files\n- Document navigation through\n  - table of content\n  - table of labels\n  - proper settings for `'include'`, `'includexpr'`, `'suffixesadd'` and\n    `'define'`, which among other things\n    - allow `:h include-search` and `:h definition-search`\n    - give enhanced `gf` command\n- Easy access to (online) documentation of packages\n- Word count (through `texcount`)\n- Motions\n  - Move between section boundaries with `[[`, `[]`, `][`, and `]]`\n  - Move between environment boundaries with `[m`, `[M`, `]m`, and `]M`\n  - Move between comment boundaries with `[*` and `]*`\n  - Move between matching delimiters with `%`\n- Text objects\n  - `ic ac` Commands\n  - `id ad` Delimiters\n  - `ie ae` LaTeX environments\n  - `i$ a$` Inline math structures\n  - `iP aP` Sections\n- Other mappings\n  - Delete the surrounding command, environment or delimiter with\n    `dsc`/`dse`/`ds$`/`dsd`\n  - Change the surrounding command, environment or delimiter with\n    `csc`/`cse`/`cs$`/`csd`\n  - Toggle starred command or environment with `tsc`/`tse`\n  - Toggle between e.g. `()` and `\\left(\\right)` with `tsd`\n  - Close the current environment/delimiter in insert mode with `]]`\n  - Insert new command with `<F7>`\n  - Convenient insert mode mappings for faster typing of e.g. maths\n- Improved folding (`:h 'foldexpr'`)\n- Improved indentation (`:h 'indentexpr'`)\n- Improved syntax highlighting\n  - Highlight matching delimiters\n  - Support for `biblatex`/`natbib` package\n  - Support for `cleveref` package\n  - Support for `listings` package\n  - Nested syntax highlighting (`minted`, `dot2tex`, `lualatex`,\n    `gnuplottex`, `asymptote`, `pythontex`)\n- Support for multi-file project packages\n  - [import](http://ctan.uib.no/macros/latex/contrib/import/import.pdf)\n  - [subfiles](http://ctan.uib.no/macros/latex/contrib/subfiles/subfiles.pdf)\n\nSee the documentation for a thorough introduction to vimtex (e.g. `:h vimtex`).\n\n## Other relevant plugins\n\nEven though vimtex provides a lot of nice features for working with LaTeX\ndocuments, there are several features that are better served by other,\ndedicated plugins. For a more detailed listing of these, please see [`:help\nvimtex-non-features`](doc/vimtex.txt#L156).\n\n### Linting and syntax checking\n\n  * [ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale)\n  * [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake)\n  * [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic)\n\n### Snippets and templates\n\n  * [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips)\n  * [neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim)\n\n### Tag navigation\n\n  * [vim-gutentags](https://github.com/ludovicchabant/vim-gutentags)\n\n## Alternatives\n\nThe following are some alternative LaTeX plugins for Vim:\n\n- [LaTeX-Box](https://github.com/LaTeX-Box-Team/LaTeX-Box)\n\n    vimtex currently has most of the features of LaTeX-Box, as well as\n    some additional ones. See [here](#features) for a relatively complete list\n    of features.\n\n    One particular feature that LaTeX-Box has but vimtex misses, is the ability\n    to do single-shot compilation _with callback_. This functionality was\n    removed because it adds a lot of complexity for relatively little gain\n    (IMHO).\n\n    Note: LaTeX-Box is included with\n    [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot). Some users are not\n    quite aware of this and end up trying vimtex with LaTeX-Box enabled. This\n    will not work --- please disable LaTeX-Box first!\n\n- [LaTeX-Suite](http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net)\n\n    The main difference between vimtex and LaTeX-Suite (aka vim-latex) is\n    probably that vimtex does not try to implement a full fledged IDE for LaTeX\n    inside Vim. E.g.:\n\n    - vimtex does not provide a full snippet feature, because this is better\n      handled by [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) or\n      [neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim) or similar snippet\n      engines.\n    - vimtex builds upon Vim principles: It provides text objects for\n      environments, inline math, it provides motions for sections and\n      paragraphs\n    - vimtex uses `latexmk`, `latexrun`, `tectonic` or `arara` for compilation\n      with a callback feature to get instant feedback on compilation errors\n    - vimtex is very modular: if you don't like a feature, you can turn it off.\n\n- [AutomaticTexPlugin](http://atp-vim.sourceforge.net)\n- [vim-latex-live-preview](https://github.com/xuhdev/vim-latex-live-preview)\n\nFor more alternatives and more information and discussions regarding LaTeX\nplugins for Vim, see:\n\n- [What are the differences between LaTeX\n  plugins](http://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/2047/what-are-the-differences-between-latex-plugins)\n- [List of LaTeX editors (not only\n  Vim)](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/339/latex-editors-ides)\n\n"
