If you are a fan of Markdown and enjoy writing Markdown notes for study, work, and life, VNote is the right tool for you.\n\n## Pleasant Markdown Experience\n### Insights About Markdown\nMarkdown, as a simple mark language, unlike rich text, was born with a **gap between edit and read**. There are about three ways to handle this gap:\n\n1. As one extreme, some editors just treat Markdown as **plain text**. Users may lose themselves in the messy black characters. It is hard to keep track of the information of the note.\n2. Most Markdown editors use two panels to **edit and preview Markdown notes simultaneously**. It makes things easier since users could see a pleasant typesetting and layout while editing the text. However, two panels may occupy the whole screen and users keep moving eyes left and right which will be a big distraction.\n3. As another extreme, some editors convert the Markdown elements in place immediately after the typing, which makes editing Markdown just like editing rich text document in Word.\n\nSince most editors choose the second way to handle the gap, people always think of preview when it comes to Markdown. It may be a misunderstanding about Markdown. Designed as a simple mark language, Markdown is intended to help to keep track of the information of the text when editing and provide a beautiful typesetting when reading after being converted to HTML.\n\n### Tradeoff: VNote\'s Way\nVNote tries to minimize the gap and provide the best-effort *WYSIWYG* for Markdown via tuned **syntax highlights** and some other features. By helping to keep track of the content, there is no need to preview or alter the text immediately after being typed.\n\n# Features\n## Notebook-Based Notes Management\nVNote uses **notebooks** to hold your notes. Like OneNote, a notebook can be hosted on any location on your system. A notebook is designed to represent one account. For example, you could have one notebook hosted on local file system and another notebook hosted on an OwnCloud server. This is really useful when notes require different levels of security.\n\nA notebook corresponds to a self-contained folder (called the *Root Folder* of the notebook) in the file system. You could copy the folder to another location (or on another computer) and import it into VNote.\n\nA notebook could have infinite levels of folders. VNote supports copying or moving folders or notes within or between notebooks.\n\n## Simple Notes Management\nAll your notes are managed by some plaintext configuration files and stored as plaintext files. You could access your notes without VNote. You could use external file synchronization services to synchronize your notes and import them on another machine.\n\nVNote supports both Markdown (suffix `md`) and rich text notes.\n\n## Syntax Highlight\nVNote supports accurate syntax highlight for Markdown. Tuning the style of the highlight, VNote enables you to keep track of your document easily.\n\nVNote also supports **syntax highlight for fenced code blocks** in edit mode in Markdown, which is **superior** than almost all current Markdown editors.\n\n![Syntax Highlight](screenshots/_1513485266_1616037517.png)\n\n## In-Place Preview\nVNote supports powerful **in-place preview** for images, diagrams, and formulas in edit mode.\n\n![In-Place Preview](screenshots/_inplacepre_1525155248_405615820.png)\n\n## Pleasant Image Experience\nJust paste your image into the Markdown note, VNote will manage all other stuffs. VNote stores images in a specified folder in the same folder with the note. VNote will pop up a window to preview the image when you insert an image. Furthermore, VNote will delete the useless image files automatically after you remove the image links.\n\n## Universal Entry & Full-Text Search\nVNote has powerful built-in full-text search with **Regular Expression** and **Fuzzy Search** support. The search could be executed within all notebooks, current notebook, or current folder, targeted at name or content.\n\nLike the `CtrlP` in Vim, VNote supports **Universal Entry** to reach anything by typing in a simple input.\n\n![Universal Entry](screenshots/_universale_1522894821_465772669.png)\n\n## Interactive Outline Viewer In Read & Edit Mode\nVNote provides a user-friendly outline viewer for both edit and view mode. The outline viewer is a responsive item tree instead of a segment of HTML.\n\n## Powerful Shortcuts\nVNote supports many pleasant and powerful shortcuts which facilitate your editing, including **Vim Mode**, **Captain Mode**, and **Navigation Mode** which enable you to work without the mouse.\n\nPlease refer to the [shortcuts help](src/resources/docs/shortcuts_en.md) in the help menu for more details.\n\n## Highly Configurable\nIn VNote, almost everything is configurable, such as background color, font, and Markdown style. VNote uses a plaintext file to record all your configuration, so you could just copy that file to initialize a new VNote on another computer.\n\n# Dependencies\n- [Qt 5.9](http://qt-project.org) (L-GPL v3)\n- [PEG Markdown Highlight](http://hasseg.org/peg-markdown-highlight/) (MIT License)\n- [Hoedown 3.0.7](https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown/) (ISC License)\n- [Marked 0.5.1](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) (MIT License)\n- [Highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/) (BSD License)\n- [Ionicons 2.0.1](https://github.com/driftyco/ionicons/) (MIT License)\n- [markdown-it 8.3.1](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) (MIT License)\n- [markdown-it-headinganchor 1.3.0](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-it-headinganchor) (MIT License)\n- [markdown-it-task-lists 1.4.0](https://github.com/revin/markdown-it-task-lists) (ISC License)\n- [markdown-it-footnote](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-footnote) (MIT License)\n- [markdown-it-sub](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-sub) (MIT License)\n- [markdown-it-sup](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-sup) (MIT License)\n- [markdown-it-front-matter](https://github.com/craigdmckenna/markdown-it-front-matter) (MIT License)\n- [markdown-it-imsize](https://github.com/tatsy/markdown-it-imsize) (Unknown) (Thanks @Kinka for help)\n- [markdown-it-emoji](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-emoji) (MIT License)\n- [markdown-it-texmath](https://github.com/goessner/markdown-it-texmath) (MIT License)\n- [markdown-it-container 2.0.0](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-container) (MIT License)\n- [mermaid 7.0.0](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) (MIT License)\n- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) (Apache-2.0)\n- [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) (Unknown)\n- [flowchart.js](https://github.com/adrai/flowchart.js) (MIT License)\n- [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) (MIT License)\n- [dom-to-image](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image) (MIT License)\n- [turndown](https://github.com/domchristie/turndown) (MIT License)\n\n# License\nVNote is licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n'
