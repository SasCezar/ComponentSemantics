b'# XVim2\n\n  XVim2 is a Vim plugin for Xcode. The plugin intends to offer a compelling Vim experience without the need to give up any Xcode features.\n  \n  - Xcode 9 or above, follow the installation instructions below.\n  - Xcode 8 or below, you should use [XVim](https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim)\n  - [Google Group for XVim developers](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/xvim-developers) has been created.\n\n## INSTALL\n\n  1. Sign Xcode with your own certificate. You can [read the instructions for how to do this](SIGNING_Xcode.md) and if you have questions or concerns about what this means you can [read the FAQ on why you need to resign Xcode to use XVim2](why_resign_xcode.md).\n  \n  2. Clone the repo. \n  ```bash\n  $ git clone https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim2.git\n  ```\n  \n  3. Confirm `xcode-select` points to your Xcode\n  ```bash\n  $ xcode-select -p\n  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\n  ```\n  \n  If this doesn\'t show your Xcode application path, use `xcode-select -s` to set.\n\n  4. Check out a branch for your Xcode version. See [Branches and Releases](#branches-and-releases) section for more information.\n  \n  5. `make`\n  ```bash\n  $ cd XVim2\n  $ make\n  ```\n\n  If you see something like \n  \n  ```\n  XVim hasn\'t confirmed the compatibility with your Xcode, Version X.X\n  Do you want to compile XVim with support Xcode Version X.X at your own risk? \n  ```\n  Press y if you want to use XVim with your Xcode version (even it is not confirmed it works)\n  \n  6. Create `.xvimrc` as you need. \n\n  7. Launch Xcode. You\'ll be asked if you load XVim. Press \'Yes\' to it.\n     If you press \'No\' by mistake, close the Xcode and execute the following from a terminal\n\n  ```\n  defaults delete  com.apple.dt.Xcode DVTPlugInManagerNonApplePlugIns-Xcode-X.X     (X.X is your Xcode version)\n  ```\n    \n  8. Relaunch Xcode.\n    \n## Branches and Releases\n \n - `master`: for the lastest GM Xcode.\n             \n - `develop`: for the next beta Xcode and develop.\n\n - tags\n   - `xcode11.2`\n   - `xcode10.3`\n   - `xcode10.2`\n   - `xcode10.1`\n   - `xcode9.4`\n   - `xcode9.3`\n   - `xcode9.2`\n\n Please use appropriate tags or branches.\n\n Please pull request to the master branch for easy bugfix and typo, or \n     to develop branch for new feature or beta Xcode support.\n     \n## Uninstall\n  ```bash\n  $ make uninstall\n  ```\n\n### Manual uninstall \nDelete the following directory:\n`$HOME/Library/Application\\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/XVim2.xcplugin`\n\n## Feature list\n  See separate [FeatureList.md](Documents/FeatureList.md)\n\n## Bug reports\n  Unfortunately XVim sometimes crashes Xcode. We are working on eliminating all the bugs, but it\'s really hard work.\n  All bug reports are appreciated, and they are especially helpful when they include the following information:\n\n   * **Crash information**. Xcode shows threads stack trace when it crashes. Please copy the stack trace and include it in your report.\n   * **The operations you performed to cause the crash**, e.g. the series of key strokes or mouse clicks you performed.\n   * **The text you were manipulating**.\n   * **Xcode version**.\n   * **XVim version**. The version number of the revision you built.\n  \n  When it is hard to solve a problem with information above, take debug log according to the following movie please.\n  \n  [How to get XVim debug log](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50Bhu8setlc&feature=youtu.be)\n\n  We appreciate if you write test case for the bug. Read "Write test" section in Documents/Developsers/PullRequest.md how to write test case. You do not need to update any source code but just write 7 items explained there in an issue you create.\n\n## Contributing\n  If you fix a bug by yourself and add new feature, see here.\n\n  [Contributing.md](Documents/Contributing.md)\n\n## Bountysource\n  XVim supports Bountysource.
