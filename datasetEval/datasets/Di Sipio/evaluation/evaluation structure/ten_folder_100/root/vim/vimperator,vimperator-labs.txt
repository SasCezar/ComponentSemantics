b'Vimperator-labs\n===============\n\n[![amo release][amo_version]][amo_release]\n[![github release][github_version]][github_release]\n\n**Make Firefox/Thunderbird look and behave like Vim**\n\n> **To beginners**: Welcome to the Vimperator-labs!  \n> This README isn\'t written usage and help for the add-on itself.\n> Try `:help` command after installing add-on for details.\n\nEnd of Life and Alternatives\n----------------------------\n\nVimperator will stop working in up-to-date copies of Firefox with the release of Firefox 57 on November 14th due to a large breaking change in how extensions and add-ons are written ([#705](https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues/705)).\n\nIt\'s not all doom and gloom, though! Here are your options ([#729](https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues/729)):\n\n - Stay with vimperator, but use an older release of Firefox or a Firefox fork\n    - The [Extended Service Release (ESR) of Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/) is still on Firefox 52 and will be vimperator compatible [until May 2018](https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar).\n    - [Waterfox](https://www.waterfoxproject.org/) is a firefox fork that merges security patches and intends to maintain compatibility with XPCOM/XUL plugins like vimperator. Note that Firefox is due to undergo rapid internal change and that waterfox will be more and more on their own as time goes on.\n\n - Use an add-on compatible with the new webextension API\n    - It is not currently possible to match the vimperator feature list in a WebExtension. Some work is being done to rectify this[[1]](https://github.com/cmcaine/keyboard-api)[[2]](https://github.com/Koushien/keyboard-shortcut-api)\n    - [cVim](https://github.com/1995eaton/chromium-vim) (Chrome/Chromium only) - features regex search, commandline with completion, autocmds (via `site` in the config), custom commands through javascript eval\n    - [Tridactyl](https://github.com/cmcaine/tridactyl) (Firefox only) - aims to eventually match the vimperator experience with working beta versions currently available on [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tridactyl-vim/)\n\n - Use a less fully-featured add-on compatible with the new WebExtension API\n    - These add-ons provide great, configurable, vim-like shortcuts and hints mode\n    - By design they do not offer insert or command mode, custom commands, autocmds, vim-style maps and so on\n    - [Vimium](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/) - "The Hacker\'s Browser. Vimium provides keyboard shortcuts for navigation and control in the spirit of Vim."\n    - [Saka-key](https://key.saka.io/) - "Put away your mouse. Saka Key lets you control your browser with keyboard shortcuts."\n    - [Vim Vixen](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vim-vixen/) - "An add-on which allows you to navigate with vim-like bindings."\n\n - Surrender your other add-ons and use a browser with built-in vim bindings\n    - Tabbed\n        - [Qutebrowser](https://www.qutebrowser.org/) - "A keyboard-driven, vim-like browser based on PyQt5 and Qt."\n        - [Luakit](https://luakit.github.io/) - "A fast, simple to use micro-browser framework extensible by Lua using the WebKit engine and the GTK+ toolkit."\n    - Not tabbed (Use a tabbed window manager or something that supports XEmbed)\n        - [vimb](https://fanglingsu.github.io/vimb/) - "A fast and lightweight vim-like web browser based on the webkit engine and the GTK toolkit."\n        - [surf](https://surf.suckless.org/) - "A simple web browser based on WebKit2/GTK+."\n        - [uzbl](https://www.uzbl.org/) - "A web browser that adheres to the unix philosophy."\n\nMuttator is not affected by these changes.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nSee also [Home page][homepage].\n\nWriting efficient user interfaces is the main maxim, here at Vimperator labs.\nWe often follow the Vim way of doing things, but extend its principles when\nnecessary.  \nTowards this end, we\'ve created the liberator library for Mozilla based\napplications, to encapsulate as many of these generic principles as possible,\nand liberate developers from the tedium of reinventing the wheel.\n\nCurrently, these applications are using this library:\n\n### Vimperator\n\nVimperator, the flagship project from Vimperator labs, creates a Vim-like\nFirefox.\n\nVimperator is a Firefox browser extension with strong inspiration from the Vim\ntext editor, with a mind towards faster and more efficient browsing.  It has\nsimilar key bindings and you could call it a modal web browser, as key bindings\ndiffer according to which mode you are in. For example, it has a special Hint\nmode, where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only.  Also most\nfunctionality is available as commands, typing `:back` will go back within the\ncurrent page history, just like hitting the back button in the toolbar.\n\n### Muttator\n\nMuttator is to Thunderbird what Vimperator is to Firefox. Combines the best\naspects of Vim and Mutt.\n\nMuttator is a free add-on for the Thunderbird mail client, which makes it look\nand behave like the Vim text editor. It has similar key bindings and you could\ncall it a modal mail client, as key bindings differ according to which mode you\nare in. For example, it the same keys can select the next message while the\nmessage list has focus or can scroll down an existing message when the message\npreview is selected. It also adds commands for accessing most Thunderbird\nfunctionality. E.g., `:contact -lastname "Vimperator" vimperator@mozdev.org`\nwill add Vimperator\'s mailing list to your address book.\n\nFeatures (Vimperator)\n---------------------\n\n- Vim-like keybindings (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `gg`, `G`, `0`, `$`, `ZZ`, etc.)\n- Ex commands (`:quit`, `:open www.foo.com`, ...)\n- Tab completion available for all commands with support for \'longest\' matching\n  when set in \'wildmode\'\n- Extensions!

Enter [Add-ons page][amo_release].\n  2. Click `Continue to Download` button.\n  3. Click `Add to Firefox` button.\n\n- Download **unsigned** <sup>2</sup> add-on from github.com (Github)\n\n  1. Enter [Releases page][github_release].\n  2. Click `vimperator-3.N.N.xpi` link under Downloads topic.\n\n- Build own version (and signing)\n  See [Build own version](#build-own-version) topic.\n\n> <sup>1</sup> If the version on [AMO][amo_release] is older than the [latest\n> release][github_release], you can build your own version and use it until AMO\n> release is updated.\n\n> <sup>2</sup> Since version 48, installing add-on to Firefox has required\n> signing. Unsigned add-on is for Unbranded Builds. See [mozilla\n> wiki][wiki_signing].\n\nBuild own version\n-----------------\n\n### Unsigned (for Unbranded Builds)\n\nSee http://www.vimperator.org/developer_info.\n\n### Signed (for Firefox 48+)\n\nInstructions for building this can be found in\nvimperator/private.properties.in. See also [MDN document][mdn_signing]\n(developer.mozilla.org) for details about signing and distribution.\n\nThere are necessary four steps to use own version.\n\n1. Prepare "AMO API key" and "jpm" if first time\n2. Build unsigned add-on\n3. Submit unsigned add-on to AMO\n4. Install signed add-on to Firefox\n5. Addition: Use Command-line interface (CLI) to build and submit\n\n#### Prepare AMO API key and jpm\n\n- [AMO API key][amo_api_key] (require Firefox Account)\n- [jpm][jpm_repo] (require node.js):\n\n  ```bash\n  npm install -g jpm\n  ```\n\n#### Build unsigned add-on\n\nClone repository and create private.properties:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs.git\ncd vimperator-labs/vimperator\ncp private.properties.in private.properties\n```\n\nThen edit private.properties so that it looks something like:\n\n```makefile\nVERSION       := $(VERSION).$(shell date \'+%Y%m%d%H%M%S\')\nUUID           = vimperator@<uniqueid> # e.g. vimperator@<yourdomain>\nAMO_API_KEY    = <your API key> # AKA "Issuer"\nAMO_API_SECRET = <your API secret>\nUPDATE_URL     =\nUPDATE_URL_XPI =\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```bash\nmake xpi\n```\n\nThe unsigned XPI should appear in\n`../downloads/vimperator-3.N.N.yyyymmddhhmmss.xpi`.\n\n#### Submit unsigned add-on to AMO\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n  <th>Have you ever submitted own version to AMO?</th><th>How to submit</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>No, I\'d like to register own version.</td>\n  <td>Enter <a\n  href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/submit/distribution">\n  How to Distribute this Version</a>, upload the XPI selecting <code>On your\n  own</code> button.\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Yes, I\'d like to update own version.</td>\n  <td>Enter <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addons">\n  Manage My Submissions</a>, upload the XPI from your Vimperator\'s <code>New\n  Version</code> link.\n  </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nThen the validation starts. Finally, automatically validation XPI finishes,\nclick `Sign add-on` button to sign.\n\n#### Install signed add-on to Firefox\n\nInstall it via the link in your AMO developer account (find your Vimperator\'s\n`Manage Status & Versions`). The new UUID makes it a new add-on, so don\'t\nforget to disable the old version.\n\n#### Use CLI to build and submit\n\nAfter once you signed the add-on, you are able to update the add-on using CLI.\n\n```bash\ncd vimperator-labs/vimperator\nmake sign\n```\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n**Vimperator is in need of collaborators!
