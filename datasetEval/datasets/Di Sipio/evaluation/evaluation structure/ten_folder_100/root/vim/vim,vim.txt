Many new\nfeatures have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line\nhistory, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,\nscript language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)\navailable.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi "in the\nfingers" will feel at home.  See `runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt` for differences with\nVi.\n\nThis editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.\nAll commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type\nwith ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be\nmapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.\n\nVim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and\nalmost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very\ndifficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga\nDOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.\n\n## Distribution ##\n\nYou can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and\nLinux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim\nif you want more features.\n\nThere are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.\nThis `README.md` file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the\ndocumentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run\nVim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.\nWhich one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you\nwant or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for\nan overview of currently available distributions.\n\nSome popular places to get the latest Vim:\n* Check out the git repository from [github](https://github.com/vim/vim).\n* Get the source code as an [archive](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases).\n* Get a Windows executable from the\n[vim-win32-installer](https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases) repository.\n\n\n\n## Compiling ##\n\nIf you obtained a binary distribution you don\'t need to compile Vim.  If you\nobtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the\n`src` directory.  See `src/INSTALL` for instructions.\n\n\n## Installation ##\n\nSee one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the\nREADMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an\narchive):\n\n\tREADME_ami.txt\t\tAmiga\n\tREADME_unix.txt\t\tUnix\n\tREADME_dos.txt\t\tMS-DOS and MS-Windows\n\tREADME_mac.txt\t\tMacintosh\n\tREADME_vms.txt\t\tVMS\n\nThere are other `README_*.txt` files, depending on the distribution you used.\n\n\n## Documentation ##\n\nThe Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be\nstarted as `vimtutor`.  See `:help tutor` for more information.\n\nThe best is to use `:help` in Vim.  If you don\'t have an executable yet, read\n`runtime/doc/help.txt`.  It contains pointers to the other documentation\nfiles.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use\nVim.  See `:help user-manual`.\n\n\n## Copying ##\n\nVim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are\nencouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file\n`runtime/doc/uganda.txt` for details (do `:help uganda` inside Vim).\n\nSummary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an\nunmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license\ntext must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.\nThe license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and\ndistribute it.\n\n\n## Sponsoring ##\n\nFixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show\nyour appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue\nworking on Vim please send a donation.\n\nSince Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children\nin Uganda.  See `runtime/doc/uganda.txt`.  But at the same time donations\nincrease Bram\'s motivation to keep working on Vim!\n\nFor the most recent information about sponsoring look on the Vim web site:\n\thttp://www.vim.org/sponsor/\n\n\n## Contributing ##\n\nIf you would like to help making Vim better, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n\n## Information ##\n\nThe latest news about Vim can be found on the Vim home page:\n\thttp://www.vim.org/\n\nIf you have problems, have a look at the Vim documentation or tips:\n\thttp://www.vim.org/docs.php\n\thttp://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki\n\nIf you still have problems or any other questions, use one of the mailing\nlists to discuss them with Vim users and developers:\n\thttp://www.vim.org/maillist.php\n\nIf nothing else works, report bugs directly:\n\tBram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>\n\n\n## Main author ##\n\nSend any other comments, patches, flowers and suggestions to:\n\tBram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>\n\n\nThis is `README.md` for version 8.1 of Vim: Vi IMproved.\n\n\n## Translations of this README ##\n\n[Korean](https://github.com/cjw1359/opensource/blob/master/Vim/README_ko.md)\n'
