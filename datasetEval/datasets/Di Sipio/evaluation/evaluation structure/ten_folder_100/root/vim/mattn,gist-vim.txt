b'# Gist.vim\n\nThis is a vimscript for creating gists (http://gist.github.com).\n\nFor the latest version please see https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim.\n\n## Usage:\n\n- Post current buffer to gist, using default privacy option.\n\n        :Gist\n\n- Post selected text to gist, using default privacy option.\n  This applies to all permutations listed below (except multi).\n\n        :\'<,\'>Gist\n\n- Create a private gist.\n\n        :Gist -p\n\n- Create a public gist.\n  (Only relevant if you\'ve set gists to be private by default.)\n\n        :Gist -P\n\n>  This is only relevant if you\'ve set gists to be private by default;\n> if you get an empty gist list, try ":Gist --abandon".\n\n- Create a gist anonymously.\n\n        :Gist -a\n\n- Create a gist with all open buffers.\n\n        :Gist -m\n\n- Edit the gist (you need to have opened the gist buffer first).\n  You can update the gist with the ":w" command within the gist buffer.\n\n        :Gist -e\n\n- Edit the gist with name \'foo.js\' (you need to have opened the gist buffer\n  first).\n\n        :Gist -e foo.js\n\n- Post/Edit with the description " (you need to have opened the gist buffer\n  first). >\n\n        :Gist -s something\n        :Gist -e -s something\n\n- Delete the gist (you need to have opened the gist buffer first).\n  Password authentication is needed.\n\n        :Gist -d\n\n- Fork the gist (you need to have opened the gist buffer first).\n  Password authentication is needed.\n\n        :Gist -f\n\n- Star the gist (you need to have opened the gist buffer first).\n  Password authentication is needed.\n\n        :Gist +1\n\n- Unstar the gist (you need to have opened the gist buffer first).\n  Password authentication is needed.\n\n        :Gist -1\n\n- Get gist XXXXX.\n\n        :Gist XXXXX\n\n- Get gist XXXXX and add to clipboard.\n\n        :Gist -c XXXXX\n\n- List your public gists.\n\n        :Gist -l\n\n- List gists from user "mattn".\n\n        :Gist -l mattn\n\n- List everyone\'s gists.\n\n        :Gist -la\n\n- List gists from your starred gists.\n\n        :Gist -ls\n\n- Open the gist on browser after you post or update it.\n\n        :Gist -b\n\n## List Feature\n\n- Useful mappings on the gist-listing buffer:\n    - Both `o` or `Enter` open the gist file in a new buffer, and close the\n      gist-vim listing one.\n    - `b` opens the gist file in a browser; this is necessary because\n      `Shift-Enter` (as was originally) only works for GUI vim.\n    - `y` copies the contents of the selected gist to the clipboard, and\n      closes the gist-vim buffer.\n    - `p` pastes the contents of the selected gist to the buffer from where\n      gist-vim was called, and closes the gist-vim buffer.\n    - Hitting `Escape` or `Tab` at the gist-vim buffer closes it.\n\n- Gist listing has fixed-length columns now, more amenable to eye inspection.\n  Every line on the gist-listing buffer contains the gist id, name and\n  description, in that order. Columns are now padded and truncated to offer a\n  faster browsing, in the following way:\n  - The gist id string is fixed at 32 characters.\n  - The length (in characters) of the name of the gist is fixed and\n    can be set by the user using, for example:\n\n    `let g:gistvim_namelength = 20`\n\n    The default value for `gistvim_namelength` is 30. If the gist (file)name\n    exceeds that length, it is truncated to the specified length.\n  - Finally, the gist description is truncated in length to fit the remaining\n    of the line, avoiding wrapped lines that mess up the table layout.\n  - Note that the gist listing buffer now does not show the field \'code\'\n    (not sure what that did in the first place).\n\n## Tips:\n\nIf you set g:gist_clip_command, gist.vim will copy the gist code with option\n\'-c\'.\n\n- Mac:\n\n        let g:gist_clip_command = \'pbcopy\'\n\n- Linux:\n\n        let g:gist_clip_command = \'xclip -selection clipboard\'\n\n- Others (cygwin?):\n\n        let g:gist_clip_command = \'putclip\'\n\nIf you want to detect filetype from the filename:\n\n    let g:gist_detect_filetype = 1\n\nIf you want to open browser after the post:\n\n    let g:gist_open_browser_after_post = 1\n\nIf you want to change the browser:\n\n    let g:gist_browser_command = \'w3m %URL%\'\n\nor:\n\n    let g:gist_browser_command = \'opera %URL% &\'\n\nOn windows, this should work with your user settings.\n\nIf you want to show your private gists with ":Gist -l":\n\n    let g:gist_show_privates = 1\n\nIf you want your gist to be private by default:\n\n    let g:gist_post_private = 1\n\nIf you want your gist to be anonymous by default:\n\n    let g:gist_post_anonymous = 1\n\nIf you want to manipulate multiple files in a gist:\n\n    let g:gist_get_multiplefile = 1\n\nIf you want to use on GitHub Enterprise:\n\n    let g:gist_api_url = \'http://your-github-enterprise-domain/api/v3\'\n\nYou need to either set global git config:\n\n\t$ git config --global github.user Username\n\n## License:\n\n    Copyright 2010 by Yasuhiro Matsumoto\n    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n    1.

The plugin stores its credentials in `~/.gist-vim`.\n\nFirst, you need to set your GitHub username in git\'s global configuration:\n\n    $ git config --global github.user <username>\n\nThen gist-vim will ask for your password in order to create an access\ntoken. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, gist-vim will also\nprompt you to enter the two-factor key you receive.\n\nWhichever type of authentication you use, your GitHub password will not be\nstored, only a OAuth access token produced specifically for gist-vim. The\ntoken is stored in `~/.gist-vim`. If you stop using the plugin, you can\neasily remove this file. To revoke the associated  GitHub token, go to the\nlist of ["Authorized applications" on GitHub\'s "Account Settings"\npage][uas].\n\n[uas]: https://github.com/settings/applications\n\n**Note:** the username is optional if you only send anonymous gists.\n'
