b'Powerline\n=========\n\n:Author: Kim Silkeb\xc3\xa6kken (kim.silkebaekken+vim@gmail.com)\n:Source: https://github.com/powerline/powerline\n:Version: beta\n\n**Powerline is a statusline plugin for vim, and provides statuslines and \nprompts for several other applications, including zsh, bash, fish, tmux,\nIPython, Awesome, i3 and Qtile.**\n\n* `Support forum`_ (powerline-support@googlegroups.com)\n* `Development discussion`_ (powerline-dev@googlegroups.com)\n\n.. image:: https://api.travis-ci.org/powerline/powerline.svg?branch=develop\n   :target: `travis-build-status`_\n   :alt: Build status\n\n.. _travis-build-status: https://travis-ci.org/powerline/powerline\n.. _`Support forum`: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/powerline-support\n.. _`Development discussion`: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/powerline-dev\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* **Extensible and feature rich, written in Python.** Powerline was \n  completely rewritten in Python to get rid of as much vimscript as \n  possible. This has allowed much better extensibility, leaner and better \n  config files, and a structured, object-oriented codebase with no mandatory\n  third-party dependencies other than a Python interpreter.\n* **Stable and testable code base.** Using Python has allowed unit testing \n  of all the project code. The code is tested to work in Python 2.6+ and \n  Python 3.\n* **Support for prompts and statuslines in many applications.** Originally \n  created exclusively for vim statuslines, the project has evolved to \n  provide statuslines in tmux and several WMs, and prompts for shells like \n  bash/zsh and other applications. It\xe2\x80\x99s simple to write renderers for any \n  other applications that Powerline doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet support.\n* **Configuration and colorschemes written in JSON.** JSON is \n  a standardized, simple and easy to use file format that allows for easy \n  user configuration across all of Powerline\xe2\x80\x99s supported applications.\n* **Fast and lightweight, with daemon support for even better performance.**\n  Although the code base spans a couple of thousand lines of code with no \n  goal of \xe2\x80\x9cless than X lines of code\xe2\x80\x9d, the main focus is on good performance \n  and as little code as possible while still providing a rich set of \n  features. The new daemon also ensures that only one Python instance is \n  launched for prompts and statuslines, which provides excellent \n  performance.\n\n*But I hate Python / I don\xe2\x80\x99t need shell prompts / this is just too much \nhassle for me / what happened to the original vim-powerline project / \xe2\x80\xa6*\n\nYou should check out some of the Powerline derivatives. The most lightweight\nand feature-rich alternative is currently the `vim-airline \n<https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline>`_ project.\n\n------\n\n* Consult the `documentation \n  <https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ for more information and \n  installation instructions.\n* Check out `powerline-fonts <https://github.com/powerline/fonts>`_ for \n  pre-patched versions of popular, open source coding fonts.\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\nVim statusline\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n**Mode-dependent highlighting**\n\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-mode-normal.png\n     :alt: Normal mode\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-mode-insert.png\n     :alt: Insert mode\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-mode-visual.png\n     :alt: Visual mode\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-mode-replace.png\n     :alt: Replace mode\n\n**Automatic truncation of segments in small windows**\n\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-truncate1.png\n     :alt: Truncation illustration\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-truncate2.png\n     :alt: Truncation illustration\n* .. image:: https://raw.github.com/powerline/powerline/develop/docs/source/_static/img/pl-truncate3.png\n     :alt: Truncation illustration\n\n----\n\nThe font in the screenshots is `Pragmata Pro`_ by Fabrizio Schiavi.\n\n.. _`Pragmata Pro`: http://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro\n'
