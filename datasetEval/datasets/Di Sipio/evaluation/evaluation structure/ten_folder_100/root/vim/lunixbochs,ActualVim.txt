b"ActualVim\n----\n\nEverything you like about using Sublime Text 3, and everything you like about typing in vim.\n\nActual uses an embedded [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) instance to accurately manipulate each Sublime Text buffer as though\nyou were editing the text directly in vim, while the Sublime Text interface, features, and plugins continue to work (see end of README for caveats).\n\nThis isn't a remote terminal UI like gvim and other vim frontends.\nText modification and selections are bidirectionally synced into the actual Sublime Text UI.\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nSublime looks way better than your terminal and has a rich plugin ecosystem.\n\nOther Sublime vim emulation plugins, including the built-in Vintage, are only rough approximations of the functionality of vim itself.\nThey are missing features or behave differently than the real thing.\n\nWith ActualVim, you can use your own vimrc, plugins, and any real vim motions/commands, because it *is* vim behind the scenes,\nand bidirectional sync means Sublime Text and the native OS interface still works too.\n\nUsage\n----\n\nThis plugin requires [Neovim to be installed](https://neovim.io/), but should otherwise work on all Sublime Text 3 platforms (tested primarily on Windows and macOS). Please use at least Neovim 0.2.2, but Neovim 0.3 or newer is highly recommended.\n\nClone ActualVim to the path found in `Preferences -> Browse Packages...` or `sublime.packages_path()`. Usually found here:\n\n- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/`\n- Linux: `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/`\n- Windows: `%APPDATA%/Sublime Text 3/Packages/`\n\nYou can set the Neovim path by opening `Preferences: ActualVim Settings` using the command palette\n(`cmd+shift+p` or `ctrl+shift+p`) or via `Preferences -> Package Settings -> ActualVim Settings`.\n\nActualVim launches a single Neovim embedded instance and multiplexes each Sublime view into a separate buffer.\n\nIf the plugin doesn't work (a horizontal underline cursor appears when ActualVim kicks in), check the Sublime Text console for errors and make sure you set the Neovim path.\nBarring that, file an issue.\n\nMisc\n----\n\nOn OS X 10.7+, you should do `defaults write com.sublimetext.3 ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false` to enable key repeat.\n\nYou can run `ActualVim: Disable` or `ActualVim: Enable` via the command pallete to toggle the input mode without losing vim state.\n\nCaveats\n----\n\nCurrently broken Sublime Features:\n\n- Multiple Selection (#8).\n- Auto-popups while typing, like completion (#57) and snippet suggestions (#94).\n- Sublime's undo isn't coalesced properly while in vim mode (it's one character at a time: #44).\n\nSurfacing vim's UI (like the status bar) still needs some love, but I have some good ideas for making it look beautiful (better than your terminal)\nusing Sublime's embedded HTML Phantom views.\n\nExtremely large files will see a performance hit until neovim supports change deltas. The `large_file_disable` command mitigates this by disabling\nActualVim for larger files (with configurable cutoff).\n"
