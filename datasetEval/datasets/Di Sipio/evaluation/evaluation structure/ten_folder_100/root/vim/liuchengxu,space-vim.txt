If you are unfamiliar with spacemacs, you can visit [spacemacs.org](http://spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION.html) for more about the principle behind that, which is also what space-vim seeks.\n\nThe distribution is completely customizable using `.spacevim`, which is equivalent to `.spacemacs` in spacemacs.\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuchengxu/img/master/space-vim/space-vim-gui.png)\n(Terminal vim with [space-vim-dark](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim-dark))\n\n[>> More screenshots](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/wiki/screenshots)\n\n## Features\n\n- **Beautiful interface:** I wrote a dark only vim colorscheme [space-vim-dark](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim-dark) based on the dark version of spacemacs-theme previously. Now we have a new option: [space-vim-theme](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim-theme), which is the successor of space-vim-dark that supports both dark and light background!\n\n  <p align="center">\n    <img width="400px" height="300px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuchengxu/img/master/space-vim-theme/light.png">\n  </p>\n\n- **Mnemonic key bindings:** commands have mnemonic prefixes like <kbd>SPC b</kbd> for all the buffer commands, this feature is mainly powered by [vim-which-key](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-which-key). Furthermore, lots of basic key bindings are provided by [vim-better-default](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-better-default). For different language layers, `<LocalLeader>`, <kbd>,</kbd> as default in space-vim, can be seen as the major-mode prefix in spacemacs.\n\n<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8850248/46784654-8e6f9800-cd61-11e8-88df-673ff5826981.png"></p>\n\n- **Lean and mean:** no nonsense wrappers, free from being bloated.\n\n## For whom?\n\n- the **novice** vim users\n- the vimmers who pursuit a beautiful appearance\n- the users **using both vim and spacemacs**\n\nHave a look at the [Introduction](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/wiki/Introduction) in wiki as well.\n\nIf you have been a vimmer for quite a while, just pick out the part you are interested in. space-vim is well-organized due to the layers concept, you can easily find what you want. Since some guys are interested in the statusline part of space-vim, this section has been extracted as [eleline.vim](https://github.com/liuchengxu/eleline.vim).\n\n## Install\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have installed:\n\n- **git**\n- **Vim** or **NeoVim**\n\nThe most recent Vim(NeoVim) version is recommended, for space-vim has been specifically optimized for Vim8 and NeoVim with respect to the startup time.\n\n[chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is an easy way to install software on Windows, tools like `fzf`, `rg`, `ag` are necessary to get you a full-featured space-vim.\n\n:exclamation: ~~When layers enabled at the first time, you need to run `:PlugInstall` to install relevant plugins~~.\n\n### Linux and macOS\n\n#### one-line installer\n\n```bash\n$ bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/master/install.sh)\n```\n\n#### Makefile\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim.git ~/.space-vim\n$ cd ~/.space-vim\n$ make vim     # install space-vim for Vim\n$ make neovim  # install space-vim for NeoVim\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nThe easist way is to download [`install.cmd`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/master/install.cmd) and **run it as administrator**, or [install space-vim manually](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/wiki/install#windows).\n\n![windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuchengxu/img/master/space-vim/win-gvim.png)\n\n### Manual\n\nGiven git and Vim/NeoVim have been installed already:\n\n1. Clone [space-vim](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim)\n\n    ```bash\n    $ git clone https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim.git ~/.space-vim\n    ```\n\n2. Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#installation), refer to vim-plug installation section for more information.\n\n3. Create the symlinks.\n\n    **Linux and macOS**\n\n    ```bash\n    # For Vim\n    $ ln -s ~/.space-vim/init.vim ~/.vimrc\n\n    # For NeoVim\n    $ ln -s ~/.space-vim/init.vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim\n\n    # Both for Vim and NeoVim\n    $ cp ~/.space-vim/init.spacevim ~/.spacevim\n    ```\n\n5. Open vim, then space-vim will automatically detect and install the missing plugins. If auto-installation fails unexpectly, please try running `:PlugInstall` manually.\n\n## Customize\n\nYou can use `.spacevim` in your home directory to customize space-vim, where you can enable the existing layers, add your extra plugins and private configurations.\n\nIf `.spacevim` does not exist, vanilla vim will be loaded! Refer to [init.spacevim](init.spacevim) as an example.\n\n### Presetting\n\n```vim\n" Comment the following line if you don\'t want Vim and NeoVim to share the\n" same plugin download directory.\nlet g:spacevim_plug_home = \'~/.vim/plugged\'\n\n" Uncomment the following line to override the leader key. The default value is space key "<\\Space>".\n" let g:spacevim_leader = "<\\Space>"\n\n" Uncomment the following line to override the local leader key. The default value is comma \',\'.\n" let g:spacevim_localleader = \',\'\n\n" Enable the existing layers in space-vim\n" Refer to https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/blob/master/layers/LAYERS.md for all available layers.\nlet g:spacevim_layers = [\n      \\ \'fzf\', \'better-defaults\', \'which-key\',\n      \\ ]\n\n" Uncomment the following line if your terminal(-emulator) supports true colors.\n" let g:spacevim_enable_true_color = 1\n\n" Uncomment the following if you have some nerd font installed.\n" let g:spacevim_nerd_fonts = 1\n\n" If you want to have more control over the layer, try using Layer command.\n" if g:spacevim.gui\n"   Layer \'airline\'\n" endif\n```\n\nPlease refer to [LAYERS.md](layers/LAYERS.md) to take a look at the whole shipped layers.\n\nBasically, `g:spacevim_layers` almost takes the place of `Layer` command. As far as I known, most people never use the option of `Layer` command, e.g., `exclude`, so `g:spacevim_layers` could save a lengthy `Layer` list, requiring less ceremony. Nevertheless, `Layer` command is still avaiable for some advanced uses.\n\n### `UserInit()`\n\n```vim\n" Manage your own plugins.\n" Refer to https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug for more detials.\nfunction! UserInit()\n\n  " Add your own plugin via Plug command.\n  Plug \'junegunn/seoul256.vim\'\n\nendfunction\n```\n\n### `UserConfig()`\n\n```vim\n" Override the default settings as well as adding extras\nfunction! UserConfig()\n\n  " Override the default settings.\n  " Uncomment the following line to disable relative number.\n  " set norelativenumber\n\n  " Adding extras.\n  " Uncomment the following line If you have installed the powerline fonts.\n  " It is good for airline layer.\n  " let g:airline_powerline_fonts = 1\n\nendfunction\n```\n\nIf have a heavy customized configuration, you can organize them in *private* directory with `packages.vim` and `config.vim` too, which will be loaded on startup. The *private* directory can be considered as either a single layer, i.e., in which you can put packages.vim and config.vim, or a set of multiple layers.\n\n## How to use\n\nFirst of all, I recommend you to look through the existing key bindings via <kbd>SPC ?</kbd>. What\'s more, you definitely can not miss reading the README of [better-defaults layer](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/blob/master/layers/%2Bdistributions/better-defaults/README.md), which is of great importance for you to get started quickly.\n\nFor detailed instruction, please refer to the README under the certain layer enabled, or you can see config.vim and packages.vim directly.\n\nIf the README is not elaborate, sorry for that, space-vim now is in the early stages and a ton of stuff are waiting to be done.\n\n### Bootstrap\n\nThe modular design is originally from [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs). The implementation of logic in space-vim is similar to [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).\n\nIf you want to know more about the bootstrap of space-vim, please see [bootstrap](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/wiki/Bootstrap) in wiki.\n\n### Commands\n\n Command      | Description\n :---         | :---\n`LayerStatus` | Check the status of layers\n`LayerCache`  | Cache the information of *layers* in `info.vim`\n\n### Tips\n\nFor the sake of a better user experience, some extra settings should be done.\n\n#### Enable GUI color in terminal vim\n\n- `:echo has(\'termguicolors\')`, if `1`, then your vim supports true colors.\n- See if your terminal-(emulator) supports true colors, refer to the gist [TrueColour.md](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728).\n\nIf these two requirements are satisfied, you could enable true color by uncommenting the line:\n\n```vim\n" Uncomment the following line if your terminal(-emulator) supports true colors.\nlet g:spacevim_enable_true_color = 1\n```\n\n#### Font\n\nSome fantastic fonts: [see wiki tips: programming-fonts](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/wiki/tips#programming-fonts).\n\n##### GUI\n\nFor instance, install [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) first and use it:\n\n```vim\nlet &guifont = \'Iosevka:h16\'\n```\n\n##### Terminal\n\n<img src="https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/blob/gh-pages/docs/img/iterm2_powerline_setting.png?raw=true" align="right" width="550px" alt="iterm2-font-setting" />\n\nFirst, install the [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) or [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) font, which is important for [airline](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/blob/master/layers/%2Bthemes/airline/README.md) layer.\n\nSecond, since console Vim uses whatever font the console/terminal is using, you\'ll have to change the font setting of your terminal.\n\n## Update\n\nRun `make update`:\n\n```bash\n$ cd path/to/space-vim\n$ make update\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can manually perform the following steps. If anything has changed with the structure of the configuration, you will have to create the appropriate symlinks.\n\n```bash\n$ cd path/to/space-vim\n$ git pull origin master\n```\n\n## Contributions\n\nIf you encounter any problem or have any suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/issues/new) or [send a PR](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim/pulls).\n\nSpace-vim is still in beta. If you are interested, contributions are highly welcome.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nI would like to thank the many people who have helped and contributed to this project.
