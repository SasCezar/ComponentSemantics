CARLA has\nbeen developed from the ground up to support development, training, and\nvalidation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code\nand protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings,\nvehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The\nsimulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and\nenvironmental conditions.\n\n[![CARLA Video](Docs/img/video_thumbnail.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOojcifcRBA)\n\nIf you want to benchmark your model in the same conditions as in our CoRL\xe2\x80\x9917\npaper, check out\n[Benchmarking](https://github.com/carla-simulator/driving-benchmarks).\n\n[**Get CARLA overnight build**](http://carla-assets-internal.s3.amazonaws.com/Releases/Linux/Dev/CARLA_Latest.tar.gz)\n\n## CARLA Ecosystem\nRepositories associated to the CARLA simulation platform:\n\n* [**Scenario_Runner**](https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner): Engine to execute traffic scenarios in CARLA 0.9.X\n* [**ROS-bridge**](https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-bridge): Interface to connect CARLA 0.9.X to ROS\n* [**Driving-benchmarks**](https://github.com/carla-simulator/driving-benchmarks): Benchmark tools for Autonomous Driving tasks\n* [**Conditional Imitation-Learning**](https://github.com/felipecode/coiltraine): Training and testing Conditional Imitation Learning models in CARLA\n* [**AutoWare AV stack**](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-autoware): Bridge to connect AutoWare AV stack to CARLA\n* [**Reinforcement-Learning**](https://github.com/carla-simulator/reinforcement-learning): Code for running Conditional Reinforcement Learning models in CARLA\n* [**Map Editor**](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-map-editor): Standalone GUI application to enhance RoadRunner maps with traffic lights and traffic signs information\n\n**Like what you see?
