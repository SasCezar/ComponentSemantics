b'Note: deepjazz is no longer being actively developed. It may be refactored at some point in the future. Goodbye and thank you for your interest \xf0\x9f\x98\xa2\n\n***\n\n![deepjazz](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9053987/16575656/901989da-424f-11e6-9f54-6a04199e69f5.png)\n\n### Using Keras & Theano for deep learning driven jazz generation\n\nI built [*deepjazz*](https://deepjazz.io) in 36 hours at a hackathon. It uses Keras & Theano, two deep learning libraries, to generate jazz music. Specifically, it builds a two-layer [LSTM](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html), learning from the given MIDI file. It uses deep learning, the AI tech that powers [Google\'s AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/alpha-go.html) and [IBM\'s Watson](https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/what-is-watson.html), **to make music -- something that\'s considered as deeply human**.\n\n[![SoundCloud](https://jisungk.github.io/deepjazz/img/button_soundcloud.png)](https://soundcloud.com/deepjazz-ai)  \nCheck out deepjazz\'s music on **[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/deepjazz-ai)**!\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* [Keras](http://keras.io/#installation)\n* [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#bleeding-edge-install-instructions) ("bleeding-edge" version on GitHub)\n* [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/installing/index.html)\n\n### Instructions\n\nRun on CPU with command:  \n```\npython generator.py [# of epochs]\n```\n\nRun on GPU with command:  \n```\nTHEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu,floatX=float32 python generator.py [# of epochs]\n```\n\nNote: running Keras/Theano on GPU is formally supported for only NVIDIA cards (CUDA backend).\n\nNote: `preprocess.py` must be modified to work with other MIDI files (the relevant "melody" MIDI part needs to be selected). The ability to handle this natively is a planned feature.\n\n### Author\n\n[Ji-Sung Kim](https://jisungkim.com)  \nPrinceton University, Department of Computer Science  \nhello (at) jisungkim.com  \n\n### Citations\n\nThis project develops a lot of preprocessing code (with permission) from Evan Chow\'s [jazzml](https://github.com/evancchow/jazzml).
