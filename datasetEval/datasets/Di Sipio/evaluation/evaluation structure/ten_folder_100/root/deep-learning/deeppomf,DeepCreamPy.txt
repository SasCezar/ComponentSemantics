DeepCreamPy takes the green colored images as input, and a neural network automatically fills in the censored regions.\n\nYou can download the latest release for Windows 64-bit [here](https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/releases/latest). \n\nFor users interested in compiling DeepCreamPy themselves, DeepCreamPy can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n\nPlease before you open a new issue check [closed issues](https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) and check the [table of contents](https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy#table-of-contents).\n\n<p align="center">\n\t<img src="https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/blob/master/readme_images/mermaid_collage.png" width="800">\n</p>\n\n## Features\n- Decensoring images of any size\n- Decensoring of ANY shaped censor (e.g. black lines, pink hearts, etc.)\n- Decensoring of mosaic decensors\n- Limited support for decensoring black and white/monochrome images\n- Generate multiple variations of decensors from the same image\n\n## Limitations\nThe decensorship is for color hentai images that have minor to moderate censorship of the penis or vagina. If a vagina or penis is completely censored out, decensoring will be ineffective.\n\nIt does NOT work with:\n- Hentai with screentones (e.g. printed hentai)\n- Real life porn\n- Censorship of nipples\n- Censorship of anus\n- Animated gifs/videos\n\n## Table of Contents\nSetup:\n* [Running latest Window 64-bit release](docs/INSTALLATION_BINARY.md)\n* [Running code yourself](docs/INSTALLATION.md)\n\nUsage:\n* [Decensoring tutorial](docs/USAGE.md)\n* [Troubleshooting for installing](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)\n* [Troubleshooting for poor quality decensors](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_DECENSORS.md)\n\nMiscellaneous:\n* [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md)\n\n## To do\n- Resolve all Tensorflow compatibility problems\n- Finish the user interface\n- Add error log\n\nFollow me on Twitter [@deeppomf](https://twitter.com/deeppomf) (NSFW Tweets) for project updates.\n\n## Contributions\nIf you want to make a pull request to DeepCreamPy, you must first sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/deeppomf/contributing/blob/master/sign-cla.md#sign-the-cla) (the "CLA").
