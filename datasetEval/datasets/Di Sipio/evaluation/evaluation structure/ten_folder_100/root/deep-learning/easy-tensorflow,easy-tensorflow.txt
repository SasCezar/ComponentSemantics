TensorFlow is one of the deep learning frameworks available with the largest community.\nThis repository is dedicated to suggesting a simple path to learn TensorFlow.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhy use TensorFlow?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. image:: _img/why_tensorflow.png\n   :height: 100px\n   :width: 200 px\n   :scale: 50 %\n   :target: https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/blob/master/_img/why_tensorflow.png\n   :align: right\n\nWe can summarize the **pros** as below:\n\n    - It\xe2\x80\x99s developed and maintained by Google. As such, a continued support and development is ensured\n    - Very large and active community\n    - Low-level and high-level interfaces to network training\n    - Tensorboard is the powerful visualization suite which is developed to track both the network topology and performance, making debugging even simpler.\n    - Written in Python (even though some parts crucial for performance is implemented in C++) which is a very attractive language to read and develop in\n    - Multiple GPUs support. So you can freely run the code on different machines without having to stop or restart the program\n    - Faster model compilation than Theano-based options\n    - Faster compile times than Theano\n    - Is about more than deep learning. TensorFlow actually has tools to support reinforcement learning and other algorithms.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned points, the large community of TensorFlow enrich the developers with the answer to almost all the\nquestions one may encounter. Furthermore, since most of the developers are using TensorFlow for code development, having a hands-on on TensorFlow is a necessity these days.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhy this repository?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn most of the available projects on the web, one of the below issues exists:\n\n - There is no or very limited explanation of what is happening in the code.\n - Different parts are not connected in a meaningful way.\n - The code implementation is too vague or complicated.\n - The focus is on either advanced or elementary level of Tensorflow implementation.\n\nIn this project, we tried to connect parts from easy to advanced with detailed tutorials while keeping the code implementation\nas simple as possible.\n\n=================================================\nTensorFlow Installation and Setup the Environment\n=================================================\n\n\nThe aim here is to explain how to install TensorFlow library "step by step" and on\ndifferent operating systems. TensorFlow is a python library. Similar to many others, we tried\ninstalling many side packages and libraries and experienced lots of problems and errors.\n\nIn order to install TensorFlow please refer to the following link:\n\n.. _TensorFlow Installation: http://easy-tensorflow.com/tf-tutorials/basics/install\n\n* `TensorFlow Installation`_\n\n\n\n====================\nTensorFlow Tutorials\n====================\n\n.. image:: _img/tensorflow.png\n   :height: 100px\n   :width: 200 px\n   :scale: 50 %\n   :target: https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/blob/master/_img/tensorflow.png\n   :align: right\n\n\nThe tutorials in this repository are partitioned into relevant categories.\n\n==========================\n\n.. +----+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+\n.. | #  |       topic         |   Source Code                                                                          |                                              |\n.. +====+=====================+========================================================================================+==============================================+\n.. | 1  | Start-up            | `Welcome <welcomesourcecode_>`_  / `IPython <ipythonwelcome_>`_                        |  `Documentation <Documentationcnnwelcome_>`_ |\n.. +----+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+\n\n.. _Installation: https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/tree/master/0_Setup_TensorFlow\n.. _Basics: https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/tree/master/1_TensorFlow_Basics\n.. _Logistic_Regression: https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/tree/master/2_Linear_Classifier\n.. _Feed_Forward_Neural_Network: https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/tree/master/3_Neural_Network\n.. _Tensorboard: https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/tree/master/4_Tensorboard\n.. _AutoEncoder: https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/tree/master/5_AutoEncoder\n.. _Convolutional_Neural_Network: https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/tree/master/6_Convolutional_Neural_Network\n\n\n+----+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| #  |       topic                 |                                                                                        |\n+====+=============================+========================================================================================+\n| 0  | Installation                | `Code <Installation_>`_                                                                |\n+----+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 1  | Basics                      | `Code <Basics_>`_                                                                      |\n+----+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 2  | Logistic_Regression         | `Code <Logistic_Regression_>`_                                                         |\n+----+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 3  | Feed_Forward_Neural_Network | `Code <Feed_Forward_Neural_Network_>`_                                                 |\n+----+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 4  | Tensorboard                 | `Code <Tensorboard_>`_                                                                 |\n+----+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 5  | AutoEncoder                 | `Code <AutoEncoder_>`_                                                                 |\n+----+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 6  | Convolutional_Neural_Network| `Code <Convolutional_Neural_Network_>`_                                                |\n+----+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n=====================\nSome Useful Tutorials\n=====================\n\n  * `TensorFlow World <https://github.com/astorfi/TensorFlow-World>`_ -
