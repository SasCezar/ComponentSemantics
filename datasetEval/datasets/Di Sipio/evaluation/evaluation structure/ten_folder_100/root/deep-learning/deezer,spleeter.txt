It makes it easy\nto train source separation model (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources), and provides\nalready trained state of the art model for performing various flavour of separation :\n\n* Vocals (singing voice) / accompaniment separation ([2 stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-2stems-model))\n* Vocals / drums / bass / other separation ([4 stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-4stems-model))\n* Vocals / drums / bass / piano / other separation ([5 stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-5stems-model))\n\n2 stems and 4 stems models have state of the art performances on the [musdb](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html) dataset. **Spleeter** is also very fast as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU. \n\nWe designed **Spleeter** so you can use it straight from [command line](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#usage)\nas well as directly in your own development pipeline as a [Python library](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/4.-API-Reference#separator). It can be installed with [Conda](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation#using-conda),\nwith [pip](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation#using-pip) or be used with\n[Docker](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-docker-image).\n\n## Quick start \n\nWant to try it out ? Just clone the repository and install a\n[Conda](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation#using-conda)\nenvironment to start separating audio file as follows:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Deezer/spleeter\nconda install -c conda-forge spleeter\nspleeter separate -i spleeter/audio_example.mp3 -p spleeter:2stems -o output\n```\nYou should get two separated audio files (`vocals.wav` and `accompaniment.wav`)\nin the `output/audio_example` folder.\n\nFor a more detailed documentation, please check the [repository wiki](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki)\n\nWant to try it out but don\'t want to install anything ? we\'ve setup a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/spleeter.ipynb)\n\n## Reference\n\n\n- Deezer Research - Source Separation Engine Story - deezer.io blog post:\n    * [English version](https://deezer.io/releasing-spleeter-deezer-r-d-source-separation-engine-2b88985e797e)\n    * [Japanese version](http://dzr.fm/splitterjp)\n- [Music Source Separation tool with pre-trained models / ISMIR2019 extended abstract](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/latebreaking/000036.pdf)\n\nIf you use **Spleeter** in your work, please cite:\n\n```BibTeX\n@misc{spleeter2019,\n  title={Spleeter: A Fast And State-of-the Art Music Source Separation Tool With Pre-trained Models},\n  author={Romain Hennequin and Anis Khlif and Felix Voituret and Manuel Moussallam},\n  howpublished={Late-Breaking/Demo ISMIR 2019},\n  month={November},\n  note={Deezer Research},\n  year={2019}\n}\n```\n\n## License\nThe code of **Spleeter** is MIT-licensed.\n\n## Disclaimer\nIf you plan to use Spleeter on copyrighted material, make sure you get proper authorization from right owners beforehand.\n\n## Note\nThis repository include a demo audio file `audio_example.mp3` which is an excerpt\nfrom Slow Motion Dream by Steven M Bryant (c) copyright 2011 Licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/stevieb357/34740\nFt: CSoul,Alex Beroza & Robert Siekawitch\n'
