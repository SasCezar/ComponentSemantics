No proprietary formats. No privacy concerns.\n\n## For the early birds ##\n\nYou're welcome to play with our demo at [demo.photoprism.org](https://demo.photoprism.org).\nLeave your email to get a [release notification](https://goo.gl/forms/KBPVGl9PCsOKrAv33).\n\nStep-by-step [installation instructions](https://docs.photoprism.org/en/latest/setup/) can be found\nin our [User Guide](https://docs.photoprism.org/en/latest/).\nDevelopers can skip this and move on to the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki).\n\nAll you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)\nto run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux and Windows.\nNote that we just [started working](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Project-Status) \non the UI and features are neither complete nor stable. \nWe plan to ship the final app as a single binary including all dependencies.\n\nIf you have a question, don't hesitate to ask in our [help forum](https://groups.google.com/a/photoprism.org/forum/#!forum/help) \nor [contact us via email](mailto:hello@photoprism.org).\n\n## Why this has to be free software ##\n\nThe development of every commercial product is focused on monetization.\nWe've [built similar apps more than once](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Mediencenter) and every single time the constraints of working\nin a profit-oriented corporate environment were an impediment.\n\nWe are sure we can do better with only a fraction of the budget. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - can be very powerful.\nGo itself is a [great example](https://talks.golang.org/2015/simplicity-is-complicated.slide).\n\nOur long-term goal is to become an open platform for machine learning [research](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Research) based on real-world photo collections.\n\n## How to contribute ##\n\nWe welcome contributions of any kind. If you have a bug or an idea, read our \n[guide](https://docs.photoprism.org/en/latest/contribute/) before opening an issue.\nIssues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) / \n[easy](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy) can be\ngood (first) contributions. \n\nYou'll get a small reward for working on [funded issues](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/funded), see [issuehunt.io](https://issuehunt.io/repos/119160553) for details.
