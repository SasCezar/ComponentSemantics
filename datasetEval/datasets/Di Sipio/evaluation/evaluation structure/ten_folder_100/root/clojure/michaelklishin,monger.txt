b'# Monger, a modern Clojure MongoDB Driver\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xingzhefeng/monger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xingzhefeng/monger)\nMonger is an idiomatic [Clojure MongoDB driver](http://clojuremongodb.info) for a more civilized age.\n\nIt has batteries included, offers powerful expressive query DSL,\nstrives to support modern MongoDB features and have the "look and feel" and\nflexibility of the MongoDB shell.\n\nMonger is built from for modern Clojure versions and sits on top of\nthe official MongoDB Java driver.\n\n\n## Project Goals\n\nThere is one MongoDB client for Clojure that has been around since 2009. So, why create another one? Monger authors\nwanted a client that would\n\n * Support most of modern MongoDB features, focus on those that really matter.\n * Be [well documented](http://clojuremongodb.info).\n * Be [well tested](https://github.com/michaelklishin/monger/tree/master/test/monger/test).\n * Target modern Clojure versions.\n * Be as close to the Mongo shell query language as practical\n * Integrate with libraries like Joda Time, [Cheshire](https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire), clojure.data.json, [Ragtime](https://github.com/weavejester/ragtime).\n * Support URI connections to be friendly to Heroku and other PaaS providers.\n * Not carry technical debt from 2009 forever.\n * Integrate usage of JavaScript files and ClojureScript (as soon as the compiler gets artifact it is possible to depend on for easy embedding).\n\n\n\n## Project Maturity\n\nMonger is not a young project: started in July 2011, it is over 7\nyears old with active production use from week 1.\n\n\n## Artifacts\n\nMonger artifacts are [released to\nClojars](https://clojars.org/com.novemberain/monger). If you are using\nMaven, add the following repository definition to your `pom.xml`:\n\n``` xml\n<repository>\n  <id>clojars.org</id>\n  <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>\n</repository>\n```\n\n### The Most Recent Release\n\nWith Leiningen:\n\n    [com.novemberain/monger "3.5.0"]\n\nWith Maven:\n\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>com.novemberain</groupId>\n      <artifactId>monger</artifactId>\n      <version>3.5.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPlease refer to our [Getting Started\nguide](http://clojuremongodb.info/articles/getting_started.html). Don\'t\nhesitate to join our [mailing\nlist](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure-mongodb) and ask\nquestions, too!\n\n\n## Documentation & Examples\n\nPlease see our [documentation guides site](http://clojuremongodb.info/) and [API reference](http://reference.clojuremongodb.info).\n\nOur [test suite](https://github.com/michaelklishin/monger/tree/master/test/monger/test)\nalso has many code examples.\n\n\n## Community\n\n[Monger has a mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure-mongodb). Feel\nfree to join it and ask any questions you may have.\n\nTo subscribe for announcements of releases, important changes and so\non, please follow [@ClojureWerkz](https://twitter.com/#!/clojurewerkz)\non Twitter.\n\n\n## Supported Clojure versions\n\nMonger requires Clojure 1.8+. The most recent\nstable release is highly recommended.\n\n\n## Continuous Integration Status\n\n[![Continuous Integration status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/michaelklishin/monger.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/michaelklishin/monger)\n\n\n## Monger Is a ClojureWerkz Project\n\nMonger is part of the [group of Clojure libraries known as ClojureWerkz](http://clojurewerkz.org), together with\n[Cassaforte](http://clojurecassandra.info), [Langohr](http://clojurerabbitmq.info), [Elastisch](http://clojureelasticsearch.info), [Quartzite](http://clojurequartz.info) and several others.\n\n\n\n## Development\n\nMonger uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make sure you have it installed and then run tests against\nsupported Clojure versions using\n    \n    ./bin/ci/before_script.sh\n    lein all do clean, javac, test\n\nThen create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done with your changes and all tests pass, submit a pull request\non Github.\n\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (C) 2011-2018 [Michael S.
