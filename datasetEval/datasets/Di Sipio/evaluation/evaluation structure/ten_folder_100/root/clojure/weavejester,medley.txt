b'# Medley\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/medley.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/medley)\n\nMedley is a lightweight Clojure/ClojureScript library of useful,\n*mostly* pure functions that are "missing" from clojure.core.\n\nMedley has a tighter focus than [flatland/useful][] or [Plumbing][],\nand limits itself to a small set of general-purpose functions.\n\n[flatland/useful]: https://github.com/flatland/useful\n[plumbing]:        https://github.com/plumatic/plumbing\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install, add the following to your project `:dependencies`:\n\n    [medley "1.2.0"]\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\nIn 0.7.0 the minimum Clojure version was changed from 1.5.1 to 1.7.0\nto take advantage of [reader conditionals][]. The `update` function\nhas also been removed, as it is now present in `clojure.core`.\n\nIn 0.6.0 the type signature of `greatest` and `least` was changed to\nbe more like `max` and `min` in Clojure core. If you\'re upgrading from\na version prior to 0.6.0, please update your usage of `greatest` and\n`least`.\n\n[reader conditionals]: http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Reader+Conditionals\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [API Docs](http://weavejester.github.io/medley/medley.core.html)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2019 James Reeves\n\nDistributed under the Eclipse Public License either version 1.0 or (at\nyour option) any later version.\n'
