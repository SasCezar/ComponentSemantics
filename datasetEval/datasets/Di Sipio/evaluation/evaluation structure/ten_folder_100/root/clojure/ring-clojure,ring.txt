b'# Ring\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ring-clojure/ring.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ring-clojure/ring)\n\nRing is a Clojure web applications library inspired by Python\'s WSGI\nand Ruby\'s Rack. By abstracting the details of HTTP into a simple,\nunified API, Ring allows web applications to be constructed of modular\ncomponents that can be shared among a variety of applications, web\nservers, and web frameworks.\n\nThe [SPEC][1] file at the root of this distribution provides a\ncomplete description of the Ring interface.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/master/SPEC\n\n## Upgrade Notice\n\nFrom version 1.2.1 onward, the ring/ring-core package no longer comes\nwith the `javax.servlet/servlet-api` package as a dependency (see\nissue [#89][2]).\n\nIf you are using the `ring/ring-core` namespace on its own, you may\nrun into errors when executing tests or running alternative adapters.\nTo resolve this, include the following dependency in your dev profile:\n\n    [javax.servlet/servlet-api "2.5"]\n\n[2]: https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/pull/89\n\n## Libraries\n\n* ring-core - essential functions for handling parameters, cookies and more\n* ring-devel - functions for developing and debugging Ring applications\n* ring-servlet - construct Java servlets from Ring handlers\n* ring-jetty-adapter - a Ring adapter that uses the Jetty webserver\n\n## Installation\n\nTo include one of the above libraries, for example `ring-core`, add\nthe following to your `:dependencies`:\n\n    [ring/ring-core "1.8.0"]\n\nTo include all of them:\n\n    [ring "1.8.0"]\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Wiki](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki)\n* [API docs](http://ring-clojure.github.com/ring)\n\n## Community\n\n* [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/ring-clojure)\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md][3].\n\n[3]: https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\n## Thanks\n\nThis project borrows heavily from Ruby\'s Rack and Python\'s WSGI;\nthanks to those communities for their work.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2009-2019 Mark McGranaghan, James Reeves & contributors.\n\nReleased under the MIT license.\n'
