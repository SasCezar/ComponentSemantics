b"# Liberator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clojure-liberator/liberator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clojure-liberator/liberator) [![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/liberator/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/liberator)\n\nLiberator is a Clojure library for building RESTful applications.\n\n## Quick Links\n\nYou can find documentation at http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator\n\nIf you have any questions, visit our fine google group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure-liberator\n\n### Similar projects\n\nLiberator used to be known as compojure-rest. It got renamed in July 2012.\n\nLiberator is loosely modeled after webmachine and shares the same aims as Bishop.\n\n## Warming up\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe examples in this document rely on you installing [leiningen 2](http://leiningen.org).\n\nWe'll also use ```curl``` for testing. If you don't have curl installed (ie. you're using Windows), there's some Clojure tests you can use instead.\n\n### Running the examples\n\nA set of examples is included.\n\nIf you want to see the examples in a browser, run\n\n    lein examples\n\nThis will start a web server on port 8000 (but you can specify a alternative port with an argument, eg. ```lein examples 8001```). Alternatively you can run the web server with ```lein ring server```).\n\n### Ensuring the tests pass\n\nLiberator uses [Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje/) for testing. You can run all the tests like this :-\n\n    lein midje\n\n# Documentation\n\nDocumentation and a tutorial can be found on [http://clojure-liberator.github.io](http://clojure-liberator.github.io).\n\n# License\n\nLiberator is licensed under EPL 1.0 (see file epl-v10.html).\n"
