b"# Event Store\n\nThe open-source, functional database with Complex Event Processing in JavaScript.\n\nThis is the repository for the open source version of Event Store, which includes the clustering implementation for high availability. \n\n## Support\n\nInformation on commercial support and options such as LDAP authentication can be found on the Event Store website at https://eventstore.org/support.\n\n## CI Status\n[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/EventStoreOSS/EventStore/_apis/build/status/EventStore.EventStore?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/EventStoreOSS/EventStore/_build/latest?definitionId=2)\n\n## Documentation\nDocumentation for Event Store can be found [here](https://eventstore.org/docs/)\n\n## Community\nWe have a fairly active [google groups list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/event-store). If you prefer slack, there is also an #eventstore channel [here](http://ddd-cqrs-es.herokuapp.com/).\n\n## Release Packages\nThe latest release packages are hosted in the downloads section on the [Event Store Website](https://eventstore.org/downloads/)\n\nWe also host native packages for Linux on [Package Cloud](https://packagecloud.io/EventStore/EventStore-OSS) and Windows packages can be installed via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/eventstore-oss) (4.0.0 onwards only).\n\n## Building Event Store\n\nEvent Store is written in a mixture of C#, C++ and JavaScript. It can run either on Mono or .NET, however because it contains platform specific code (including hosting the V8 JavaScript engine), it must be built for the platform on which you intend to run it.\n\n### Linux\n**Prerequisites**\n- [Mono 5.16.0](https://www.mono-project.com/download/)\n- [.NET Core SDK 2.1.402](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)\n\n**Required Environment Variables**\n```\nexport FrameworkPathOverride=/usr/lib/mono/4.7.1-api\n```\n\n### Windows\n**Prerequisites**\n- [.NET Framework 4.7.1 (Developer Pack)](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)\n- [.NET Core SDK 2.1.402](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)\n\n### Mac OS X\n**Prerequisites**\n- [Mono 5.16.0](https://www.mono-project.com/download/)\n- [.NET Core SDK 2.1.402](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)\n\n**Required Environment Variables**\n```\nexport FrameworkPathOverride=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/5.16.0/lib/mono/4.7.1-api/\n```\n\n### Build EventStore\nOnce you've installed the prerequisites for your system, you can launch a `Release` build of EventStore as follows:\n```\ndotnet build -c Release src/EventStore.sln\n```\n\nTo start a single node, you can then run:\n```\nbin/Release/EventStore.ClusterNode/net471/EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --db ../db --log ../logs\n```\n\nYou'll need to launch the node with `mono` on Linux or Mac OS X.\n\n_Note: The build system has changed after version `4.1.1-hotfix1`, therefore the above instructions will not work for old releases._\n\n### Running the tests\nYou can launch the tests as follows:\n\n#### EventStore Core tests\n```\ndotnet test src/EventStore.Core.Tests/EventStore.Core.Tests.csproj -- RunConfiguration.TargetPlatform=x64\n```\n\n#### EventStore Projections tests\n```\ndotnet test src/EventStore.Projections.Core.Tests/EventStore.Projections.Core.Tests.csproj -- RunConfiguration.TargetPlatform=x64\n```\n\n## Building the EventStore Client / Embedded Client\nYou can build the client / embedded client with the steps below. This will generate a nuget package file (.nupkg) that you can include in your project.\n#### Client\n```\ndotnet pack -c Release src/EventStore.ClientAPI/EventStore.ClientAPI.csproj /p:Version=5.0.0\n```\n\n#### Embedded Client\n```\ndotnet pack -c Release src/EventStore.ClientAPI.Embedded/EventStore.ClientAPI.Embedded.csproj /p:Version=5.0.0\n```\n\n\n## Building the EventStore web UI\nThe web UI is prebuilt and the files are located under [src/EventStore.ClusterNode.Web/clusternode-web](src/EventStore.ClusterNode.Web/clusternode-web).\nIf you want to build the web UI, please consult this [repository](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore.UI) which is also a git submodule of the current repository located under `src/EventStore.UI`.\n\n## Building the Projections Library\nThe list of precompiled projections libraries can be found in `src/libs/x64`. If you still want to build the projections library please follow the links below.\n- [Linux](scripts/build-js1/build-js1-linux/README.md)\n- [Windows](scripts/build-js1/build-js1-win/build-js1-win-instructions.md)\n- [Mac OS X](scripts/build-js1/build-js1-mac/build-js1-mac.sh)\n\n## Contributing\n\nDevelopment is done on the `master` branch.\nWe attempt to do our best to ensure that the history remains clean and to do so, we generally ask contributors to squash their commits into a set or single logical commit.\n\nIf you want to switch to a particular release, you can check out the tag for this particular version. For example:  \n`git checkout oss-v4.1.0`"
