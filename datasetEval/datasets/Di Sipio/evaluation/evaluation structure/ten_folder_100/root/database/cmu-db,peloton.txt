We have abandoned this repository and moved on to build a new DBMS. There are a several engineering techniques and designs that we learned from this first system on how to support autonomous operations that we are doing a much better job at implementing in the second system.\n\nWe will not accept pull requests for this repository. We will also not respond to questions or problems that you may have with running with this software.\n\nWe will announce the new system later in 2019.\n\n## What Is Peloton?\n\n* A self-driving SQL database management system.\n* Integrated artificial intelligence components that enable autonomous optimization.\n* Native support for byte-addressable non-volatile memory (NVM) storage technology.\n* Lock-free multi-version concurrency control to support real-time analytics.\n* Postgres network-protocol and JDBC compatible.\n* High-performance, lock-free Bw-Tree for indexing.\n* 100% Open-Source (Apache Software License v2.0).\n\n## What Problem Does Peloton Solve?\n\nDuring last two decades, researchers and vendors have built advisory tools to assist database administrators in system tuning and physical design. This work is incomplete because they still require the final decisions on changes in the database, and are reactionary measures that fix problems after they occur.\n\nA new architecture is needed for a truly \xe2\x80\x9cself-driving\xe2\x80\x9d database management system (DBMS) which is designed for autonomous operations. This is different than earlier attempts because all aspects of the system are controlled by an integrated planning component. In addition to optimizing the system for the current workload, it predicts future workload trends which lets the system prepare itself accordingly. This eliminates the requirement of a human to determine the right way, and reduces time taken to deploy the changes, optimizing the DBMS to provide high-performance. Auto-management of these systems has surpassed the abilities of human experts.\n\nPeloton is a relational database management system designed for fully autonomous optimization of hybrid workloads.
