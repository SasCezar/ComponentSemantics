The backup is a zip file that contains all files in the directories you specify along with a dump of your database. The backup can be stored on [any of the filesystems you have configured in Laravel 5](http://laravel.com/docs/filesystem).\n\nFeeling paranoid about backups? No problem! You can backup your application to multiple filesystems at once.\n\nOnce installed taking a backup of your files and databases is very easy. Just issue this artisan command:\n\n``` bash\nphp artisan backup:run\n```\n\nBut we didn't stop there. The package also provides [a backup monitor to check the health of your backups](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-backup/v6/monitoring-the-health-of-all-backups/overview). You can be [notified via several channels](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-backup/v6/sending-notifications/overview) when a problem with one of your backups is found.\nTo avoid using excessive disk space, the package can also [clean up old backups](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-backup/v6/cleaning-up-old-backups/overview).\n\nSpatie is a web design agency in Antwerp, Belgium. You'll find an overview of all our open source projects [on our website](https://spatie.be/opensource).\n\n## Installation and usage\n\nThis package requires PHP 7.2 and Laravel 5.8 or higher.  \nYou'll find installation instructions and full documentation on https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-backup.\n\n## Using an older version of PHP / Laravel?\n\nIf you are on a PHP version below 7.2 or a Laravel version below 5.8 just use an older version of this package. \n\nRead the extensive [documentation on version 3](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-backup/v3), [on version 4](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-backup/v4) and [on version 5](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-backup/v5).
