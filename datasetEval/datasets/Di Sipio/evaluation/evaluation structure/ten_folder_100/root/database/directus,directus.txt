Both can easily be customized and extended to suit your project\'s needs._\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x90\xb0 Introduction\n\nDirectus is an open-source suite of software that provides an instant API wrapper for SQL databases and an intuitive Admin App for non-technical users to manage that content. It\'s like a safe, friendly, and super-powered "database client" (eg: _PHP-my-Admin_ or _Sequel Pro_). Created in 2004, our premium platform powers hundreds-of-thousands of data-driven applications around the world. With our JSON API, webhooks, and complete control over where and how your content is used \xe2\x80\x94 what will you build with Directus?\n\n* **[Directus API](https://github.com/directus/api)** \xe2\x80\x94 Wraps any new or existing SQL database with RESTful JSON endpoints for connecting content anywhere: websites, native apps, wearables, IoT devices, kiosks, or anything else!\n* **[Directus Admin App](https://github.com/directus/app)** \xe2\x80\x94 A friendly admin interface built with Vue.js that works in conjunction with our API to allow non-technical users to manage database content and digital assets.\n* **[Directus Suite](https://github.com/directus/directus)** A package that combines our API, Admin App, and all dependencies for quick and easy installation on most servers.\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## \xe2\x9c\xa8 Key Concepts\n\n### Database-First\n\nDirectus follows a database-first approach, storing all of your data _unaltered_ in pure SQL databases with that can be completely customized.\n\n#### Access and Optimization\n\nDirectus mirrors _your_ actual database so it will automatically stay in sync with any changes made directly to the database! With the full power of SQL unlocked, you can:\n\n1. Architect your actual database with meaningful table and column names\n2. Infinitely optimize with indexing, datatypes, lengths, defaults, keys, encoding, etc\n3. Update your database schema at any point and Directus will instantly reflect changes\n4. Create, update, and delete content directly from the database\n\n#### Direct Access\n\nThis database-first approach means that you have the option to completely bypass Directus if needed. Connecting your application _directly_ to the database means Directus is completely bypassed, removing even the slightest possiblility of a bottleneck, and giving you the unbridled power of complex SQL queries.\n\n#### Portability and Transparency\n\nDirectus is _not_ a black-box system. There is nothing proprietary or opinionated about how Directus stores your content so you\'re never locked-in or locked out. Import existing SQL to get started quickly, and rest assured that you can also export your unaltered content as vanilla SQL at any point. You can also self-host the entire suite on your own servers if needed or use our hosted Cloud service.\n\n#### Complex Relationships\n\nWhether you need many-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, or something completely different... Directus has you covered. You can interrelate database fields, then fetch deeply nested data using our robust dot-notation parameters.\n\n### Simple, Modular and Extensible\n\nWe\'ve intentionally kept our codebase as simple and lightweight as possible. Every aspect of Directus has been modularized, with many options for extending, overriding, or even bypassing the core system. Choose your auth providers, storage adapters, content interfaces, data presentation, and more. We also have webhooks, event hooks, API response filters, custom endpoints, CSS/JS override files, and much more.\n\nFurthermore, because the codebase has been internally decoupled, Directus supports full multitenancy. You can use a single Directus App to manage multiple Directus API instances, and each API instance can manage multiple databases (projects or environments).\n\n### Internationalization and Accessibility\n\nDirectus allows you to manage multilingual content in as many languages as your project needs. And no matter what language(s) your organization requires, our Admin App supports a growing number of locales. We\'ve also paid close attention to our Admin App\'s interface to ensure it is as clear and accessible as possible for all users.\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x93\x96 Documentation\n\n* [What is Directus?](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/introduction.html#what-is-directus)\n* [Installing the Directus Suite](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/installation.html)\n* [Extending Directus](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/)\n* Directus App\n  * [App Docs](https://docs.directus.io/advanced/app/standalone.html)\n  * [User Guide](https://docs.directus.io/guides/user-guide.html)\n  * [Install the App](https://docs.directus.io/advanced/app/standalone.html#installation)\n* Directus API\n  * [API Docs](https://docs.directus.io/advanced/api/standalone.html)\n  * [API Reference](https://docs.directus.io/api/reference.html)\n  * [Install the API](https://docs.directus.io/advanced/api/standalone.html#installation)\n* Tutorials\n  * [Tutorials](https://medium.com/directus)\n  * [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD--x9rY3ZL31stRPkA4FdGC4idIM-8-d)\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb2 Help & Resources\n\n### Technical Support\n\n* **Community Support** \xe2\x80\x94 For help with open-source instances please post questions with the `directus` tag on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/directus) or chat with members of our online community.\n* **Premium Support** \xe2\x80\x94 Directus Cloud customers, Patreon Sponsors, and those paying for hourly support all have access to our Live support over our [Live Chat](https://directus.io) or [Email](mailto:support@directus.io).\n\n### Community\n\n* **[Slack](https://directus.chat)** \xe2\x80\x94 Come join over a thousand members discussing the future of Directus.
