b'dataset: databases for lazy people\n==================================\n\n[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/pudo/dataset.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pudo/dataset)\n\nIn short, **dataset** makes reading and writing data in databases as simple as reading and writing JSON files.\n\n[Read the docs](https://dataset.readthedocs.io/)\n\nTo install dataset, fetch it with ``pip``:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install dataset\n```\n\n**Note:** as of version 1.0, **dataset** is split into two packages, with the\ndata export features now extracted into a stand-alone package, **datafreeze**.\nSee the relevant repository [here](https://github.com/pudo/datafreeze).\n'
