b'OmniSciDB (formerly MapD Core)\n==============================\n\nOmniSciDB is an open source SQL-based, relational, columnar database engine that leverages the full performance and parallelism of modern hardware (both CPUs and GPUs) to enable querying of multi-billion row datasets in milliseconds, without the need for indexing, pre-aggregation, or downsampling.  OmniSciDB can be run on hybrid CPU/GPU systems (Nvidia GPUs are currently supported), as well as on CPU-only systems featuring X86, Power, and ARM (experimental support) architectures. To achieve maximum performance, OmniSciDB features multi-tiered caching of data between storage, CPU memory, and GPU memory, and an innovative Just-In-Time (JIT) query compilation framework.\n\nTo find out more, please check out the [OmniSci Website](https://www.omnisci.com) and the [OmniSciDB wiki](https://github.com/omnisci/omniscidb/wiki/).\n\nFor more details, see the [OmniSciDB Developer Documentation](https://omnisci.github.io/omniscidb/)\n\n# Quickstart\n\n- Install the dependencies mentioned in the [Dependencies](https://github.com/omnisci/omniscidb/wiki/OmniSciDB-Dependencies) page.\n- Read up about [building, running tests, and basic usage and configuration](https://github.com/omnisci/omniscidb/wiki/OmniSciDB-Documentation#building).\n- [Download and install](https://github.com/omnisci/omniscidb/wiki/OmniSciDB-Documentation#DownloadsandInstallationInstructions) the package.\n- Initialize servers [using a wrapper](https://github.com/omnisci/omniscidb/wiki/OmniSciDB-Documentation#starting-using-the-startomnisci-wrapper) or [manually](https://github.com/omnisci/omniscidb/wiki/OmniSciDB-Documentation#starting-manually)\n- [Load sample data.](#working-with-data) Sample sets can be found in the [Data Set Library](https://community.omnisci.com/browse/new-item2).\n- Perform a sample query\n\nFor complete [download and installation instructions](https://github.com/omnisci/omniscidb/wiki/OmniSciDB-Documentation#downloads-and-installation-instructions), please visit the [Documentation](https://github.com/omnisci/omniscidb/wiki/OmniSciDB-Documentation) page.\n\n## Diving In\n\n- How-tos, code snippets and more on the [OmniSci Blog](https://www.omnisci.com/blog/)\n- [Tutorials & Demos](https://github.com/omnisci/omniscidb/wiki/Tutorials-&-Demos)\n- Need a data set to practice with?
