From personal computers to multi-region hybrid clouds.\n\nThe smallest CrateDB clusters can easily ingest tens of thousands of records per second. And this data can be queried, ad-hoc, in parallel across the whole cluster in real time.\n\nScreenshots\n===========\n\nCrateDB provides an admin UI:\n\n.. image:: crate-admin.gif\n    :alt: Screenshots of the CrateDB admin UI\n    :target: http://play.crate.io/\n\nTry CrateDB\n===========\n\nThe fastest way to try CrateDB out is by running::\n\n    $ bash -c "$(curl -L try.crate.io)"\n\nOr spin up the official `Docker image`_::\n\n    $ docker run -p 4200:4200 crate\n\nVisit the `getting started`_ page to see all the available download and install options.\n\nOnce you\'re up and running, head on over to `the introductory docs`_.\n\nContributing\n============\n\nThis project is primarily maintained by Crate.io_, but we welcome community\ncontributions!\n\nSee the `developer docs`_ and the `contribution docs`_ for more information.\n\nHelp\n====\n\nLooking for more help?\n\n- Read `the project documentation`_\n- Check out our `support channels`_\n\n.. _contribution docs: CONTRIBUTING.rst\n.. _Crate.io: http://crate.io/\n.. _developer docs: devs/docs/index.rst\n.. _Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/_/crate/\n.. _getting started: https://crate.io/docs/getting-started/\n.. _support channels: https://crate.io/support/\n.. _the introductory docs: https://crate.io/docs/crate/getting-started/en/latest/first-use/index.html\n.. _the project documentation: https://crate.io/docs/\n'
