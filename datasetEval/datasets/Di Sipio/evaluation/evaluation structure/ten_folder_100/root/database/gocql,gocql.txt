Due to limits in our CI setup we only test against the latest 3 major releases, which coincide with the official support from the Apache project.\n\nSunsetting Model\n----------------\n\nIn general, the gocql team will focus on supporting the current and previous versions of Go. gocql may still work with older versions of Go, but official support for these versions will have been sunset.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n    go get github.com/gocql/gocql\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Modern Cassandra client using the native transport\n* Automatic type conversions between Cassandra and Go\n  * Support for all common types including sets, lists and maps\n  * Custom types can implement a `Marshaler` and `Unmarshaler` interface\n  * Strict type conversions without any loss of precision\n  * Built-In support for UUIDs (version 1 and 4)\n* Support for logged, unlogged and counter batches\n* Cluster management\n  * Automatic reconnect on connection failures with exponential falloff\n  * Round robin distribution of queries to different hosts\n  * Round robin distribution of queries to different connections on a host\n  * Each connection can execute up to n concurrent queries (whereby n is the limit set by the protocol version the client chooses to use)\n  * Optional automatic discovery of nodes\n  * Policy based connection pool with token aware and round-robin policy implementations\n* Support for password authentication\n* Iteration over paged results with configurable page size\n* Support for TLS/SSL\n* Optional frame compression (using snappy)\n* Automatic query preparation\n* Support for query tracing\n* Support for Cassandra 2.1+ [binary protocol version 3](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/doc/native_protocol_v3.spec)\n  * Support for up to 32768 streams\n  * Support for tuple types\n  * Support for client side timestamps by default\n  * Support for UDTs via a custom marshaller or struct tags\n* Support for Cassandra 3.0+ [binary protocol version 4](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/doc/native_protocol_v4.spec)\n* An API to access the schema metadata of a given keyspace\n\nPerformance\n-----------\nWhile the driver strives to be highly performant, there are cases where it is difficult to test and verify. The driver is built\nwith maintainability and code readability in mind first and then performance and features, as such every now and then performance\nmay degrade, if this occurs please report and issue and it will be looked at and remedied. The only time the driver copies data from\nits read buffer is when it Unmarshal\'s data into supplied types.\n\nSome tips for getting more performance from the driver:\n* Use the TokenAware policy\n* Use many goroutines when doing inserts, the driver is asynchronous but provides a synchronous API, it can execute many queries concurrently\n* Tune query page size\n* Reading data from the network to unmarshal will incur a large amount of allocations, this can adversely affect the garbage collector, tune `GOGC`\n* Close iterators after use to recycle byte buffers\n\nImportant Default Keyspace Changes\n----------------------------------\ngocql no longer supports executing "use <keyspace>" statements to simplify the library. The user still has the\nability to define the default keyspace for connections but now the keyspace can only be defined before a\nsession is created. Queries can still access keyspaces by indicating the keyspace in the query:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM example2.table;\n```\n\nExample of correct usage:\n```go\n\tcluster := gocql.NewCluster("192.168.1.1", "192.168.1.2", "192.168.1.3")\n\tcluster.Keyspace = "example"\n\t...\n\tsession, err := cluster.CreateSession()\n\n```\nExample of incorrect usage:\n```go\n\tcluster := gocql.NewCluster("192.168.1.1", "192.168.1.2", "192.168.1.3")\n\tcluster.Keyspace = "example"\n\t...\n\tsession, err := cluster.CreateSession()\n\n\tif err = session.Query("use example2").Exec(); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n```\nThis will result in an err being returned from the session.Query line as the user is trying to execute a "use"\nstatement.\n\nExample\n-------\n\n```go\n/* Before you execute the program, Launch `cqlsh` and execute:\ncreate keyspace example with replication = { \'class\' : \'SimpleStrategy\', \'replication_factor\' : 1 };\ncreate table example.tweet(timeline text, id UUID, text text, PRIMARY KEY(id));\ncreate index on example.tweet(timeline);\n*/\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t"fmt"\n\t"log"\n\n\t"github.com/gocql/gocql"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// connect to the cluster\n\tcluster := gocql.NewCluster("192.168.1.1", "192.168.1.2", "192.168.1.3")\n\tcluster.Keyspace = "example"\n\tcluster.Consistency = gocql.Quorum\n\tsession, _ := cluster.CreateSession()\n\tdefer session.Close()\n\n\t// insert a tweet\n\tif err := session.Query(`INSERT INTO tweet (timeline, id, text) VALUES (?, ?, ?)`,\n\t\t"me", gocql.TimeUUID(), "hello world").Exec(); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tvar id gocql.UUID\n\tvar text string\n\n\t/* Search for a specific set of records whose \'timeline\' column matches\n\t * the value \'me\'. The secondary index that we created earlier will be\n\t * used for optimizing the search */\n\tif err := session.Query(`SELECT id, text FROM tweet WHERE timeline = ? LIMIT 1`,\n\t\t"me").Consistency(gocql.One).Scan(&id, &text); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tfmt.Println("Tweet:", id, text)\n\n\t// list all tweets\n\titer := session.Query(`SELECT id, text FROM tweet WHERE timeline = ?`, "me").Iter()\n\tfor iter.Scan(&id, &text) {\n\t\tfmt.Println("Tweet:", id, text)\n\t}\n\tif err := iter.Close(); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nData Binding\n------------\n\nThere are various ways to bind application level data structures to CQL statements:\n\n* You can write the data binding by hand, as outlined in the Tweet example. This provides you with the greatest flexibility, but it does mean that you need to keep your application code in sync with your Cassandra schema.\n* You can dynamically marshal an entire query result into an `[]map[string]interface{}` using the `SliceMap()` API. This returns a slice of row maps keyed by CQL column names. This method requires no special interaction with the gocql API, but it does require your application to be able to deal with a key value view of your data.\n* As a refinement on the `SliceMap()` API you can also call `MapScan()` which returns `map[string]interface{}` instances in a row by row fashion.\n* The `Bind()` API provides a client app with a low level mechanism to introspect query meta data and extract appropriate field values from application level data structures.\n* The [gocqlx](https://github.com/scylladb/gocqlx) package is an idiomatic extension to gocql that provides usability features. With gocqlx you can bind the query parameters from maps and structs, use named query parameters (:identifier) and scan the query results into structs and slices. It comes with a fluent and flexible CQL query builder that supports full CQL spec, including BATCH statements and custom functions.\n* Building on top of the gocql driver, [cqlr](https://github.com/relops/cqlr) adds the ability to auto-bind a CQL iterator to a struct or to bind a struct to an INSERT statement.\n* Another external project that layers on top of gocql is [cqlc](http://relops.com/cqlc) which generates gocql compliant code from your Cassandra schema so that you can write type safe CQL statements in Go with a natural query syntax.\n* [gocassa](https://github.com/hailocab/gocassa) is an external project that layers on top of gocql to provide convenient query building and data binding.\n* [gocqltable](https://github.com/kristoiv/gocqltable) provides an ORM-style convenience layer to make CRUD operations with gocql easier.\n\nEcosystem\n---------\n\nThe following community maintained tools are known to integrate with gocql:\n\n* [gocqlx](https://github.com/scylladb/gocqlx) is a gocql extension that automates data binding, adds named queries support, provides flexible query builders and plays well with gocql.\n* [journey](https://github.com/db-journey/journey) is a migration tool with Cassandra support.\n* [negronicql](https://github.com/mikebthun/negronicql) is gocql middleware for Negroni.\n* [cqlr](https://github.com/relops/cqlr) adds the ability to auto-bind a CQL iterator to a struct or to bind a struct to an INSERT statement.\n* [cqlc](http://relops.com/cqlc) generates gocql compliant code from your Cassandra schema so that you can write type safe CQL statements in Go with a natural query syntax.\n* [gocassa](https://github.com/hailocab/gocassa) provides query building, adds data binding, and provides easy-to-use "recipe" tables for common query use-cases.\n* [gocqltable](https://github.com/kristoiv/gocqltable) is a wrapper around gocql that aims to simplify common operations.\n* [gockle](https://github.com/willfaught/gockle) provides simple, mockable interfaces that wrap gocql types\n* [scylladb](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla) is a fast Apache Cassandra-compatible NoSQL database\n* [go-cql-driver](https://github.com/MichaelS11/go-cql-driver) is an CQL driver conforming to the built-in database/sql interface. It is good for simple use cases where the database/sql interface is wanted. The CQL driver is a wrapper around this project.\n\nOther Projects\n--------------\n\n* [gocqldriver](https://github.com/tux21b/gocqldriver) is the predecessor of gocql based on Go\'s `database/sql` package. This project isn\'t maintained anymore, because Cassandra wasn\'t a good fit for the traditional `database/sql` API. Use this package instead.\n\nSEO\n---\n\nFor some reason, when you Google `golang cassandra`, this project doesn\'t feature very highly in the result list. But if you Google `go cassandra`, then we\'re a bit higher up the list. So this is note to try to convince Google that golang is an alias for Go.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n> Copyright (c) 2012-2016 The gocql Authors.
