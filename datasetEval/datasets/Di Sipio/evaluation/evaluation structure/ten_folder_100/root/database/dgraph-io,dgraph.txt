It's built from ground up to perform for\na rich set of queries. Being a native graph database, it tightly controls how the\ndata is arranged on disk to optimize for query performance and throughput,\nreducing disk seeks and network calls in a cluster.\n\n\nDgraph's goal is to provide [Google](https://www.google.com) production level scale and throughput,\nwith low enough latency to be serving real time user queries, over terabytes of structured data.\nDgraph supports [GraphQL-like query syntax](https://docs.dgraph.io/master/query-language/), and responds in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) over [GRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) and HTTP.\n\n## Status\n\nDgraph is [at version 1.1.x][rel] and is production ready. Apart from the vast open source community, it is being used in\nproduction at multiple Fortune 500 companies, and by\n[Intuit Katlas](https://github.com/intuit/katlas) and [VMware Purser](https://github.com/vmware/purser).\n\n[rel]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/releases\n\n## Quick Install\n\nThe quickest way to install Dgraph is to run this command on Linux or Mac.\n\n```bash\ncurl https://get.dgraph.io -sSf | bash\n```\n\n## Install with Docker\n\nIf you're using Docker, you can use the [official Dgraph image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dgraph/dgraph/).\n\n```bash\ndocker pull dgraph/dgraph:latest\n```\n\n## Install from Source\n\nIf you want to install from source, install Go 1.11+ or later and the following dependencies:\n\nUbuntu:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gcc make\n```\n\nThen clone the Dgraph repository and use `make install` to install the Dgraph binary to `$GOPATH/bin`.\n\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph.git\ncd ./dgraph\nmake install\n```\n\n## Get Started\n**To get started with Dgraph, follow:**\n\n- Installation to queries in 3 steps via [docs.dgraph.io](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/).\n- A longer interactive tutorial via [tour.dgraph.io](https://tour.dgraph.io).\n- Tutorial and\npresentation videos on [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCghE41LR8nkKFlR3IFTRO4w/featured).\n\n## Is Dgraph the right choice for me?\n\n- Do you have more than 10 SQL tables, connected to each other via foreign keys?\n- Do you have sparse data, which doesn't elegantly fit into SQL tables?\n- Do you want a simple and flexible schema, which is readable and maintainable\n  over time?\n- Do you care about speed and performance at scale?\n\nIf the answers to the above are YES, then Dgraph would be a great fit for your\napplication. Dgraph provides NoSQL like scalability while providing SQL like\ntransactions and ability to select, filter and aggregate data points. It\ncombines that with distributed joins, traversals and graph operations, which\nmakes it easy to build applications with it.\n\n## Dgraph compared to other graph DBs\n\n| Features | Dgraph | Neo4j | Janus Graph |\n| -------- | ------ | ----- | ----------- |\n| Architecture | Sharded and Distributed | Single server (+ replicas in enterprise) | Layer on top of other distributed DBs |\n| Replication | Consistent | None in community edition (only available in enterprise) | Via underlying DB |\n| Data movement for shard rebalancing | Automatic | Not applicable (all data lies on each server) | Via underlying DB |\n| Language | GraphQL inspired | Cypher, Gremlin | Gremlin |\n| Protocols | Grpc / HTTP + JSON / RDF | Bolt + Cypher | Websocket / HTTP |\n| Transactions | Distributed ACID transactions | Single server ACID transactions | Not typically ACID\n| Full Text Search | Native support | Native support | Via External Indexing System |\n| Regular Expressions | Native support | Native support | Via External Indexing System |\n| Geo Search | Native support | External support only | Via External Indexing System |\n| License | Apache 2.0 | GPL v3 | Apache 2.0 |\n\n## Users\n- **Dgraph official documentation is present at [docs.dgraph.io](https://docs.dgraph.io).**\n- For feature requests or questions, visit\n  [https://discuss.dgraph.io](https://discuss.dgraph.io).\n- Check out [the demo at dgraph.io](http://dgraph.io) and [the visualization at\n  play.dgraph.io](http://play.dgraph.io/).\n- Please see [releases tab](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/releases) to\n  find the latest release and corresponding release notes.\n- [See the Roadmap](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2894) for list of\n  working and planned features.\n- Read about the latest updates from Dgraph team [on our\n  blog](https://open.dgraph.io/).\n- Watch tech talks on our [YouTube\n  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCghE41LR8nkKFlR3IFTRO4w/featured).\n\n## Developers\n- See a list of issues [that we need help with](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).\n- Please see [Contributing to Dgraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on contributions.\n\n## Client Libraries\nThe Dgraph team maintain a number of [officially supported client libraries](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/).
