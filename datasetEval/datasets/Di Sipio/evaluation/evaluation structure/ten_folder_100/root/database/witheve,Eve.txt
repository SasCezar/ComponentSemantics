b'<p align="center">\n  <img src="http://www.witheve.com/logo.png" alt="Eve logo" width="10%" />\n</p>\n\n---\n \nEve is a programming language based on years of research into building a human-first programming platform. \n\n**This repository hosts a preview of Eve v0.3 alpha, which is no longer under active development.**\n\n## Getting Started with Eve v0.3 preview\n\nInstall [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your platform, then clone and build the [Eve starter repository](https://github.com/witheve/eve-starter):\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:witheve/eve-starter.git\ncd eve-starter\nnpm install\n```\n\nYou can start the program switcher, which allows you to browse included example programs:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nOr you can run a specific program by providing its path as an argument:\n\n```\nnpm start -- path/to/program.js\n```\n\n## Integrating Eve into an existing project\n\nYou can get Eve as an npm package\n\n```\nnpm install witheve@preview\n```\n\nThen import Eve to use it in your project\n\n```\nimport {Program} from "witheve";\n```\n\n## Learning Eve\n\nYou can learn about Eve with the following resources:\n\n- [Read the Quick Start Tutorial](http://play.witheve.com/) (use Chrome for best results)\n- [Syntax Quick Reference](https://witheve.github.io/assets/docs/SyntaxReference.pdf)\n- [Language Handbook (draft)](http://docs.witheve.com)\n\nAlso, the [mailing list archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk) is a good resource for help and inspiration. In particular, the [Puzzles & Paradoxes series](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/eve-talk/Puzzles$20$26$20Paradoxes%7Csort:date) answers a lot of questions beginners face about the Eve langauge.\n\n## Get Involved\n\n### Join the Community\n\nThe Eve community is small but constantly growing, and everyone is welcome!\n\n- Join or start a discussion on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk).\n- Impact the future of Eve by getting involved with our [Request for Comments](https://github.com/witheve/rfcs) process.\n- Read our [development blog](http://incidentalcomplexity.com/).\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/with_eve).\n\n### How to Contribute\n\nThe best way to contribute right now is to write Eve code and report your experiences. [Let us know](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk) what kind of programs you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to write, what barriers you are facing in writing code (both mental and technological), and any errors you encounter along the way.\n\n### How to File an Issue\n\nPlease file any issues in this repository.
