It is a subset of ImageNet, collected by [MXNet](http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/). It includes 1,474,703 images and 11,221 categories. However, we find there are many abstract categories in visual domain, such as "event", "summer", etc. We think that the training images annotated with such abstract categories \nwill not help (even harm) the visual representation learning. Thus, we abandon these categories. \n* Part 2: We filter the URLs of Open Images via a per-class criteria. Firstly, if one class occurs in less than 650 URLs, then it is removed. Besides, we also 1) remove some abstract categories as did above, and 2) merge some redundant categories with those in ImageNet. Then, if all annotated tags of one URL are removed, then this URL is abandoned. Consequently,  6,902,811 training URLs and 159,424 validation URLs are remained, covering 1,134 unique categories.\n--->\n<!---\nWe then merge URLs from above two parts according to their categories. Specifically, we firstly all categories to their unique WordIDs defined in [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/). According to the semantic topological structure of WordIDs, if two categories share the same WordID or are synonymous, then they are merged to a unique category, as well as their URLs. \nFinally, the number of remained URLs is 17,659,752, and the number of categories is 11,166. \n--->\n\n<!---\nConsequently,  8,385,050 training URLs and 159,424 validation URLs are remained, covering 2,039 categories.\n--->\n\n### [Download Images](#download-images)\n[[back to top](#)]\n\nDue to the copyright, we cannot provide the original images directly. However, one can obtain all images of our database using the following files:\n* train_image_id_from_imagenet.txt ([Link1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7x4wPa764MJkjhhNj0PWPhgwMJOXziA/view?usp=sharing), [Link2](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1oUfIMCHj1wyz0ywuSn1iEQ))\n* val_image_id_from_imagenet.txt ([Link1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-1x1vJFZGesz-5R2W8DLWHaVEbIPjuJs/view?usp=sharing), [Link2](https://pan.baidu.com/s/10prwZcHstYA8ppyXxbEbXA))\n* train_urls_from_openimages.txt ([Link1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1__HFVimF5yUwlyEjaUoSmBBfRQKJTYKW/view?usp=sharing), [Link2]( https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jjkaLu5JiHV6D0qyWXSxMA ))\n* val_urls_from_openimages.txt ([Link1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkTcEEkB1zYI6NtAM-vXpsv7uDZ3glEz/view?usp=sharing), [Link2](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1F8mk58IGj9BP0-HSF-M9aw))\n\n<!--- ##### Download images from ImageNet --->\n\n#### [Download Images from ImageNet](#download-images-from-imagenet)\nWe find that massive urls provided by ImageNet have expired (please check the file `List of all image URLs of Fall 2011 Release` at http://image-net.org/download-imageurls). Thus, here we provide the original image IDs of ImageNet used in our database. One can obtain the training/validation images of our database through the following steps:\n* Download the whole database of [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/download-images)\n* Extract the training/validation images using the image IDs in `train_image_id_from_imagenet.txt` and `val_image_id_from_imagenet.txt`\n\nThe format of `train_image_id_from_imagenet.txt` is as follows:\n```\n...\nn04310904/n04310904_8388.JPEG   2367:1  2172:1  1831:1  1054:1  1041:1  865:1   2:1\nn11753700/n11753700_1897.JPEG   5725:1  5619:1  5191:1  5181:1  5173:1  5170:1  1042:1  865:1   2:1\n...\n```\nAs shown above, one image corresponds to one row. The first term is the original image ID of ImageNet. The followed terms separated by space are the annotations. For example, "2367:1" indicates class 2367 and its confidence 1. Note that the class index starts from 0, and you can find the class name from the file [data/dictionary_and_semantic_hierarchy.txt](data/dictionary_and_semantic_hierarchy.txt).\n\n**NOTE**: We find that there are some repeated URLs in `List of all image URLs of Fall 2011 Release` of ImageNet, i.e., the image corresponding to one URL may be stored in multiple sub-folders with different image IDs. We manually check a few repeated images, and find the reason is that one image annotated with a child class may also be annotated with its parent class, then it is saved to two sub-folders with different image IDs. To the best of our knowledge, this point has never been claimed in ImageNet or any other place. If one want to use ImageNet, this point should be noticed. \nDue to that, there are also a few repeated images in our database, but our training is not significantly influenced. In future, we will update the database by removing the repeated images. \n\n\n#### [Download Images from Open Images](#download-images-from-open-images)\n\n<!---\n* train_urls.txt ([link1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ExY0GpRWxGzDHAI-p44m-B0AB76NeLy7), [link2](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1cx6n6CYNqegKVq1O2YVCJg))\n* val_urls.txt ([link1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13SSar872e73UcshIW7IGbmvUGcFjHyxg), [link2](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1BfipStD2PY7MAMRoZa9ecg))\n--->\n\nThe images from Open Images can be downloaded using URLs. \nThe format of `train_urls_from_openimages.txt` is as follows:\n```\n...\nhttps://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7239/6997334729_e5fb3938b1_o.jpg  3:1  5193:0.9  5851:0.9 9413:1 9416:1\nhttps://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3035/3033882900_a9a4263c55_o.jpg  1053:0.8  1193:0.8  1379:0.8\n...\n```\nAs shown above, one image corresponds to one row. The first term is the image URL. The followed terms separated by space are the annotations. For example, "5193:0.9" indicates class 5193 and its confidence 0.9. \n\n##### Download Images using URLs\nWe also provide the code to download images using URLs. \nAs `train_urls_from_openimages.txt` is very large, here we provide a tiny file [train_urls_tiny.txt](data/train_urls_tiny.txt) to demonstrate the downloading procedure.\n```\ncd data\n./download_urls_multithreading.sh\n```\nA sub-folder `data/images` will be generated to save the downloaded jpeg images, as well as a file `train_im_list_tiny.txt` to save the image list and the corresponding annotations. \n\n\n\n\n### [Semantic Hierarchy](#semantic-hierarchy)\n[[back to top](#)]\n\nWe build the semantic hiearchy of 11,166 categories, according to [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/). \nThe direct parent categories of each class can be found from the file [data/dictionary_and_semantic_hierarchy.txt](data/dictionary_and_semantic_hierarchy.txt). The whole semantic hierarchy includes 4 independent trees, of which \nthe root nodes are `thing`, `matter`, `object, physical object` and `atmospheric phenomenon`, respectively. \nThe length of the longest semantic path from root to leaf nodes is 16, and the average length is 7.47. \n\n### [Annotations](#annotations)\n[[back to top](#)]\n\nSince the image URLs of ML-Images are collected from ImageNet and Open Images, the annotations of ML-Images are constructed based on the \noriginal annotations from ImageNet and Open Images. Note that the original annotations from Open Images are licensed by Google Inc. under [CC BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Specifically, we conduct the following steps to construct the new annotations of ML-Images. \n* For the 6,902,811 training URLs from Open Images, we remove the annotated tags that are out of the remained 1,134 categories.\n* According to the constructed [semantic hierarchy](data/dictionary_and_semantic_hierarchy.txt) of 11,166 categories, we augment the annotations of all URLs of ML-Images following the cateria that if one URL is annotated with category i, then all ancestor categories will also be annotated to this URL. \n* We train a ResNet-101 model based on the 6,902,811 training URLs from Open Images, with 1,134 outputs. Using this ResNet-101 model, we predict the tags from 1,134 categories for the 10,756,941 single-annotated image URLs from ImageNet. Consequently, we obtain a normalized co-occurrence matrix between 10,032 categories from ImageNet and 1,134 categories from Open Images. We can determine the strongly co-occurrenced pairs of categories. For example, category i and j are strongly co-occurrenced; then, if one image is annotated with category i, then category j should also be annotated. \n\nThe annotations of all URLs in ML-Images are stored in `train_urls.txt` and `val_urls.txt`.\n\n<!---\n\xef\xbc\x88\xe6\x9c\x89\xe5\x85\xb3Open Images\xe7\x9a\x84\xe9\x83\xa8\xe5\x88\x86\xef\xbc\x8c\xe5\x9b\xa0\xe4\xb8\xbaAnnotations\xe6\x98\xaf\xe9\x80\x82\xe7\x94\xa8CC BY-4.0\xef\xbc\x88https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\xef\xbc\x89\xef\xbc\x8c\xe6\x89\x80\xe4\xbb\xa5\xe5\xa6\x82\xe6\x9e\x9c\xe6\x9c\x89\xe4\xbf\xae\xe6\x94\xb9\xe7\x9a\x84\xe8\xaf\x9d\xef\xbc\x8c\xe6\x98\xaf\xe9\x9c\x80\xe8\xa6\x81\xe6\xb3\xa8\xe6\x98\x8e\xe7\x9a\x84\xe3\x80\x82 License\xe6\x96\x87\xe4\xbb\xb6\xe6\x88\x91\xe4\xbc\x9a\xe6\x8f\x90\xef\xbc\x8c\xe4\xbd\x86\xe6\x82\xa8\xe4\xbb\xacrearme\xe6\x9c\x80\xe5\xa5\xbd\xe4\xb9\x9f\xe8\xa6\x81\xe5\x86\x99\xef\xbc\x8c\xe5\x8f\xaf\xe4\xbb\xa5\xe5\x8f\x82\xe8\x80\x83\xef\xbc\x9ahttps://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution#This_is_a_good_attribution_for_material_you_modified_slightly\n\xe5\x9b\xa0\xe4\xb8\xbaLicense\xe6\x96\x87\xe4\xbb\xb6\xe6\x88\x91\xe5\x8f\xaa\xe6\x8f\x90\xe8\xaf\xb4\xef\xbc\x9a\xe4\xbb\xa5\xe4\xb8\x8b\xe7\x9a\x84\xe6\x96\x87\xe4\xbb\xb6\xe5\x8f\xaf\xe8\x83\xbd\xe5\xb7\xb2\xe8\xa2\xab\xe4\xbf\xae\xe6\x94\xb9\xef\xbc\x8c\xe4\xbd\x86readme\xe9\x87\x8c\xe9\x9d\xa2\xe5\xb0\xb1\xe5\x8f\xaf\xe8\x83\xbd\xe8\xa6\x81\xe5\x86\x99\xe6\x9b\xb4\xe8\xaf\xa6\xe7\xbb\x86\xe7\x82\xb9\xef\xbc\x8c\xe5\x83\x8f\xe4\xb8\x8a\xe9\x9d\xa2\xe9\x82\xa3\xe4\xb8\xaa\xe9\x93\xbe\xe6\x8e\xa5\xe9\x87\x8c\xe7\x9a\x84\xe8\x8c\x83\xe4\xbe\x8b\xef\xbc\x89\n--->\n\n### [Statistics](#statistics)\n[[back to top](#)]\n\nThe main statistics of ML-Images are summarized in ML-Images.\n                             \n                                                      \n| # Train images  | # Validation images  | # Classes | # Trainable Classes | # Avg tags per image |  # Avg images per class |\n| :-------------: |:--------------------:| :--------:| :-----------------: |:-------------------:|  :---------------------:|\n| 17,609,752       | 88,739          | 11,166    | 10,505              |  8.72    |  13,843 |\n\nNote: *Trainable class* indicates the class that has over 100 train images.\n\n<br/>\n \nThe number of images per class and the histogram of the number of annotations in training set are shown in the following figures.       \n\n<img  src="git_images/num_images_per_class.png" alt="GitHub" title="num images per class" width="430" height="240" />        <img  src="git_images/hist_num_annotations.png" alt="GitHub" title="histogram of num annotations" width="400" height="240" />\n\n\n# [Train](#train)\n[[back to top](#)]\n\n\n<!---\n### [Download Images using URLs](#download-images-using-urls)\n[[back to top](#)]\n--->\n\n<!---\nThe full `train_urls.txt` is very large. \nHere we provide a tiny file [train_urls_tiny.txt](data/train_urls_tiny.txt) to demonstrate the downloading procedure.\n```\ncd data\n./download_urls_multithreading.sh\n```\nA sub-folder `data/images` will be generated to save the downloaded jpeg images, as well as a file `train_im_list_tiny.txt` to save the image list and the corresponding annotations. \n--->\n\n<!---\n**Note**\xef\xbc\x9aSome URLs in [train_url.txt](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1cx6n6CYNqegKVq1O2YVCJg) have expired or may expire in future.
