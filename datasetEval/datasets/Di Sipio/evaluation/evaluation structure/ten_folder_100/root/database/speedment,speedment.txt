The toolkit analyzes the metadata of an existing SQL database and automatically creates a Java representation of the data model. This powerful ORM enables you to create scalable and efficient Java applications using **standard Java** streams with no need to type SQL or use any new API. \n\nSpeedment was originally developed by researchers and engineers based in Palo Alto with the purpose to simplify and streamline the development of Java database applications by leveraging the Java Stream API. \n\nSpeedment is licensed under the business-friendly Apache 2 license. Contribution from users is encouraged. Please feel free to request new features, suggest improvements and file bug reports.

This means there is no need for manually writing SQL-queries any more. You can remain in a pure Java world!\n\n<img align="left" src="https://github.com/speedment/speedment-resources/blob/master/src/main/resources/wiki/frontpage/SQL-Stream.png?raw=true." alt="Streams to SQL" width="400px">\n\n#### Example\nSearch in a film database for a film with a length greater than 120 minutes:\n```java\n// Searches are optimized in the background!\nOptional<Film> longFilm = films.stream()\n    .filter(Film.LENGTH.greaterThan(120))\n    .findAny();\n``` \n\nResults in the following SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT \n    `film_id`,`title`,`description`,`release_year`,\n    `language_id`,`original_language_id`,`rental_duration`,`rental_rate`,\n    `length`,`replacement_cost`,`rating`,`special_features`,\n    `last_update` \nFROM \n     `sakila`.`film\nWHERE\n    (`length` > 120)\n```\n<br>\n\n## Features\nSpeedment is equipped with the features listed below and more. \n\n### View Database Tables as Standard Java Streams\n\n<img src="https://github.com/speedment/speedment-resources/blob/master/src/main/resources/wiki/frontpage/stream-api.png?raw=true" alt="Stream API" title="Stream API" align="right" width="25%" />\n\n* **Pure Java** - Stream API instead of SQL eliminates the need of a query language<br>\n* **Dynamic Joins** - Ability to perform joins as Java streams on the application side<br>\n* **Parallel Streams** - Workload can automatically be divided over several threads<br>\n<br>\n\n### Short and Concise Type Safe Code \n\n<img src="https://github.com/speedment/speedment-resources/blob/master/src/main/resources/wiki/frontpage/type-safety.png?raw=true" alt="Type Safety" title="Type Safety" align="right" width="25%" />\n\n* **Code Generation** - Automatic Java representation of the latest state of your database eliminates boilerplate code and the need of manually writing Java Entity classes while minimizing the risk for bugs.<br>\n* **Null Protection** - Minimizes the risk involved with database null values by wrapping to Java Optionals<br>\n* **Enum Integration** - Mapping of String columns to Java Enums increases memory efficiency and type safety<br>\n\n<img src="https://github.com/speedment/speedment-resources/blob/master/src/main/resources/wiki/frontpage/lazy-evaluation.png?raw=true" alt="Lazy Evaluation" title="Lazy Evaluation" align="right" width="25%" />\n\n### Lazy Evaluation for Increased Performance\n\n* **Streams are Lazy** - Content from the database is pulled as elements are needed and consumed<br>\n* **Pipeline Introspection** - Optimized performance by short circuiting of stream operations<br>\n\n## Tutorials\nThe tutorials are divided into three sections.
