There is a growing number of applications leveraging the drawer pattern. Most share a similar look and feel. With JVFloatingDrawer we aimed to bring a facelift to the conventional setup.\n\n![Opening Drawer Animation](http://jvillella.github.io/JVFloatingDrawer/Screenshots/animated-drawer-open-portrait.gif "Opening Drawer")\n\n\n## Usage\n\nJVFloatingDrawer is very easy to use. Below is all that is needed to get going.\n    \n    JVFloatingDrawerViewController *drawerViewController = [[JVFloatingDrawerViewController alloc] init];\n    \n    // Assign to your own view controllers\n    drawerViewController.leftViewController   = leftDrawerViewController;\n    drawerViewController.rightViewController  = rightDrawerViewController;\n    drawerViewController.centerViewController = centerViewController;\n    \n    self.drawerViewController.backgroundImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"background-image-example.jpg"];\n    \n    drawerViewController.animator = [[JVFloatingDrawerSpringAnimator alloc] init];\n    \nTo see an example implementation of this run the example project. Clone the repo, run `pod install` from the Example directory, and open up `Example/JVFloatingDrawer.xcworkspace`.\n\n## Installation\n\nJVFloatingDrawer is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install\nit, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n    pod "JVFloatingDrawer"\n\n## How it Works\n\nJVFloatingDrawer is split up into several extensible components that communicate with each other.\n\n#### `JVFloatingDrawerViewController`\n\nThe `JVFloatingDrawerViewController` maintains references to a center, left, and/or right `UIViewController` object. The `centerViewController` can be replaced simply by reassigning it to a different view controller. The same goes for the `leftViewController` and `rightViewController`.\n\n##### Opening and Closing the Drawer\n\n`JVFloatingDrawerViewController` is where you open, close, and toggle your side drawers.\n\n    - (void)openDrawerWithSide:(JVFloatingDrawerSide)drawerSide animated:(BOOL)animated\n                    completion:(void(^)(BOOL finished))completion;\n    \n    - (void)closeDrawerWithSide:(JVFloatingDrawerSide)drawerSide animated:(BOOL)animated\n                     completion:(void(^)(BOOL finished))completion;\n    \n    - (void)toggleDrawerWithSide:(JVFloatingDrawerSide)drawerSide animated:(BOOL)animated\n                      completion:(void(^)(BOOL finished))completion;\n    \n##### Drawer Widths\n    \nYou can also customize the `leftDrawerWidth` and `rightDrawerWidth` by setting these properties.\n\n##### Background Image\n\nThe background image is set by assigning the `backgroundImage` property.\n\n##### Animators\n\nAnimators are the main players of `JVFloatingDrawer`. `JVFloatingDrawer` comes with a prebuilt spring animator that can be customized by settings its `animationDuration`, `animationDelay`, `springDamping`, and `initialSpringVelocity`. After instantiating a new animator object you assign it to the `animator` property on the `JVFloatingDrawerViewController` to let it work its magic. You can make your own animators by implementing the `JVFloatingDrawerAnimation` protocol. More on that later.\n\n#### `JVFloatingDrawerView`\n\n`JVFloatingDrawerView` is an internal class that you will not have to deal with as a user. It\'s tasked with laying out the drawer via autolayout constraints. It handles decorations like the shadow and rounded corners you see around the center view controller. Each view controller (center, left, and right) of the `JVFloatingDrawerViewController` are wrapped in `UIView` containers. This is how we support swapping drawers.\n\n## Creating Your Own Animators\n\nThe `JVFloatingDrawerSpringAnimator` class is a featured animator for you to use. If you want to create your own however, it\'s easy. All animators adhere to the `JVFloatingDrawerAnimation` protocol. `JVFloatingDrawerAnimation` has two *required* methods **presentation** and **dismissal**:\n\n#### Presentation\n\n`- (void)presentationWithSide:(JVFloatingDrawerSide)drawerSide sideView:(UIView *)sideView centerView:(UIView *)centerView animated:(BOOL)animated completion:(void(^)(BOOL finished))completion`\n\nGiven a drawer side, the containing side view, and the containing center view, implementations must bring the side view on screen. If the `drawerSide` is equal to `JVFloatingDrawerSideLeft` the view will be *left-adjacent* to the  `centerView`. If the `drawerSide` is equal to `JVFloatingDrawerSideRight` the view will be *right-adjacent* to the  `centerView`. You have complete control over how you do this. I used view transforms in my implementation and called `UIView`\'s `-animateWithDuration:delay:usingSpringWithDamping:...`. Technically, you don\'t even have to make it floating. You could copy the traditional drawer slide-in style if you like. Finally, implementations must react accordingly if the user wants this animated or not via the `animated` flag, and then call the `completion` block at the end.\n\n#### Dismissal\n\n`- (void)dismissWithSide:(JVFloatingDrawerSide)drawerSide sideView:(UIView *)sideView centerView:(UIView *)centerView animated:(BOOL)animated completion:(void(^)(BOOL finished))completion`\n\nDismissal is the exact same as presentation except it needs to be able to get the current position of the open drawer and move it off screen. Again, how you do this is up to you.\n\n#### Optional Methods\n\n`- (void)willRotateOpenDrawerWithOpenSide:(JVFloatingDrawerSide)drawerSide sideView:(UIView *)sideView centerView:(UIView *)centerView`\n\n`- (void)didRotateOpenDrawerWithOpenSide:(JVFloatingDrawerSide)drawerSide sideView:(UIView *)sideView centerView:(UIView *)centerView`\n\n`-willRotateOpenDrawerWithOpenSide:sideView:centerView` is invoked right *before* a device orientation change so the animator can handle it. `-didRotateOpenDrawerWithOpenSide:sideView:centerView` is invoked right *after*. The `JVFloatingDrawerSpringAnimator` only implements `-didRotateOpenDrawerWithOpenSide:sideView:centerView` and calls the same code as `-presentationWithSide:sideView:centerView:animated:completion:` in it.\n\n## Author\n\nJulian Villella\n\n## License\n\nJVFloatingDrawer is available under the MIT license.
