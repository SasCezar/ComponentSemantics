b'# Introduction #\n\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/layerJS/layerJS](https://badges.gitter.im/layerJS/layerJS.svg)](https://gitter.im/layerJS/layerJS?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n[layerJS.org](https://layerjs.org) is an open source Javascript UI/UX library allowing intuitive, visually intense, mobile app-like experiences for web apps and websites. \n\nUX patterns like menus, sliders, layers & light boxes, parallax effects, page-swipes, zoom effects, etc. are really just interactive animated layers. layerJS provides one simple universal concept to create such patterns in pure HTML: the Stage-Frame concept. Frames are containers that contain your content, e.g. sub pages, screens, menu panes, lightboxes, cards, slides, etc. Stages are viewports into which the frame content is dynamically fit. The root Stage is usually the browser window and its Frames represent sub pages or app screens. Frames can be exchanged within Stages using animated transitions like swipes, fades. Stages and Frames can be nested, so in an app screen(frame) a slider(stage) can exist which contains a set of slides (frames). Stages can have one or more overlapping layers with different frames, allowing effects like floating menus or parallax backgrounds.\n\nlayerJS\xe2\x80\x99 concept resembles the principles of material design. In particular, layerJS\xe2\x80\x99 frames are the papers/surfaces in material design. The stages are a convenient way to define the layout and the principal movements of the surfaces. With stages, animated transitions of the user interface can simply be defined by which frame should be shown in which stage in the next step.\n\nTransitions are triggered through plain HTML links which simply name the frame which should be navigated to. layerJS also supports directional touch and touchpad gestures to trigger transitions. Use your fingers to pull down menus or swipe through a list of sub pages. Transitions can also be triggered through the API.\n\nWatch this animation on how it works: [https://layerjs.org/#explain-animation](https://layerjs.org/#explain-animation)\n\n\n## Quickstart ##\n\nlayerJS can be included into your site from our CDN. Simply include the following tags into the head of your HTML document.\n```\n<script src="http://cdn.layerjs.org/libs/layerjs/layerjs-0.6.2.min.js"></script>\n<link href="http://cdn.layerjs.org/libs/layerjs/layerjs-0.6.2.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />\n```\n\nIn layerJS you will define stages, layers and frames simply by adding HTML-attributes to `<div>`s. Here is an example structure:\n```\n<div data-lj-type="stage">\n    <div data-lj-type="layer" data-lj-default-frame="main" >\n        <div data-lj-type="frame" >\n            \xe2\x80\xa6 your HTML code \xe2\x80\xa6\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\nFind examples and live demos on our project website [layerjs.org](http://layerjs.org/examples.html). \n\nCheck out the [Wiki](https://github.com/layerJS/layerJS/wiki) for more details. \n\n## Issues, bug reports and feature requests ##\n\nIf you experience any issues or bugs using layerJS or you would like to request features, please let us know through bitbucket [issue tracking](https://github.com/layerJS/layerJS/issues). This issue tracker is open to everyone so we encourage discussion on all issues.\n\n## How to contribute ##\n\nContributions to layerJS are more than welcome.
