Hyperion plugins are designed to make inspection of your app quick and simple.\n\nPlease see our annoucement [blog post](https://willowtreeapps.com/ideas/introducing-hyperion-for-android) for a feature showcase.\n\n![Demo Attribute inspector](https://images.ctfassets.net/3cttzl4i3k1h/1KhiROG0wcSi8QYa6iYGI0/0cd93ebf5a67012c09e16964032ea7e6/image2new.gif)\n\n## Third-Party Plugins\nBe one of the first to create a third-party plugin. The plugin creation guide is a work in progress, but if you are feeling ambitious you can reference the plugins we have already created.\n\nTo create your own plugin, implement the Plugin interface and expose the implementation as a service. The plugins made available in this repository leverage Google\'s [AutoService](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/service) annotation processor to generate the service metadata and simplify the process.\n\n## How To Show Hyperion Plugin List\nOnce Hyperion is integrated into your app, simply shake your phone to activate. If you are running your app on an emulator, you can manually open the menu by calling `Hyperion.open(Activity activity)`. You can also open the menu by selecting the foreground notification that appears while the client app is in the foreground.\n\n## Sample App\nWant to learn how to use Hyperion? The sample app will teach you!\n\nBuild the example project by cloning the repo, run `./gradlew assemble` from the root directory, then open in Android Studio and run.\n\n## Requirements\nmin SDK 15\n\nDownload\n--------\n\nDownload via Maven:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.willowtreeapps.hyperion</groupId>\n  <artifactId>hyperion-core</artifactId>\n  <version>0.9.27</version>\n</dependency>\n```\nor Gradle:\n```groovy\ndebugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-core:0.9.27\'\n```\n\nIf you reference Hyperion from your code, you should also compile the no-op artifact for release variants. For most users, this will not be necessary:\n```groovy\nreleaseImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-core-no-op:0.9.27\'\n```\n\nIf you want to be on the bleeding-edge, you can try out the SNAPSHOT version.\n\n```groovy\nrepositories {\n  maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots" }\n}\ndependencies {\n  debugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-core:0.9.28-SNAPSHOT\'\n}\n```\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInclude the core library along with any number of plugins.\n\n```groovy\ndebugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-core:0.9.27\'\ndebugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-attr:0.9.27\'\ndebugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-build-config:0.9.27\'\ndebugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-crash:0.9.27\'\ndebugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-disk:0.9.27\'\ndebugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-geiger-counter:0.9.27\'\ndebugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-measurement:0.9.27\'\ndebugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-phoenix:0.9.27\'\ndebugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-recorder:0.9.27\'\ndebugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-shared-preferences:0.9.27\'\ndebugImplementation \'com.willowtreeapps.hyperion:hyperion-timber:0.9.27\'\n```\n\n## Adding Plugins\nHyperion plugins need to be added into the app at build time.\nBy default, Hyperion automatically finds every plugin that is available in the project using the Java Service Locator.\n\n## Contributing to Hyperion\nContributions are welcome. Please see the [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nHyperion has adopted a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) defined by the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org), the same used by the [Swift language](https://swift.org) and countless other open source software teams.\n\n## Plugin Descriptions\nThe following is a list of all plugins that integrate with Hyperion.
