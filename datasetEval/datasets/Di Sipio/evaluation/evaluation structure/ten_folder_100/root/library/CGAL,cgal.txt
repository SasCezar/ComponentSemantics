b"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CGAL/cgal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CGAL/cgal)\n\n![CGAL](Installation/doc_html/images/cgal_2013_grey.png)\n\nThe Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) is a C++ library that\naims to provide easy access to efficient and reliable algorithms in\ncomputational geometry.\n\nCGAL Releases\n=============\nThe primary vector of distribution of CGAL are sources tarballs, released\ntwice a year, announced on [the web site of CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/).\n\nGetting Started with CGAL\n=========================\n\n**Since version 5.0, CGAL is a header-only library, meaning that\nit is no longer needed to build CGAL libraries before it can be used.**\n\nHead over to the [CGAL manual](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/general_intro.html)\nfor usage guides and tutorials that will get you started smoothly.\n\nLicense\n=======\nSee the file [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).\n\nCGAL Git Repository Layout\n==========================\n\nThe Git repository of CGAL has a different layout from release tarballs. It\ncontains a `CMakeLists.txt` file that serves as anchor for configuring and building programs,\nand a set of subfolders, so called *packages*. Most packages\nimplement a data structure or an algorithm for CGAL (e.g., `Convex_hull_2`,\nor `Triangulation_3`); however some packages serve special needs:\n\n* `Installation` - meta-files and CMake-support\n* `Maintenance` - infrastructural support\n* `Core`, `CGALimageIO`, `Qt_widget`, `GraphicsView` - component libraries\n* `Scripts` - scripts to simplify developer's and user's work\n* `Testsuite` - infrastructure for testsuite\n* `Documentation` - infrastructure for CGAL's manual\n* `STL_Extension` - extensions to the standard template library\n\nMore Information\n================\n* [The CGAL web site](https://www.cgal.org/)\n* [Latest CGAL release documentation pages](https://doc.cgal.org/)\n* [Latest CGAL master documentation pages, updated once a week](https://cgal.geometryfactory.com/CGAL/doc/master/)\n* [CGAL daily testsuite results](https://cgal.geometryfactory.com/CGAL/testsuite/)\n* [Guidelines for CGAL developers](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/wiki/Guidelines) and [Informations for new developers](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/wiki/Information-for-New-Developers)\n"
