b"# Web Fundamentals on DevSite\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/WebFundamentals.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/WebFundamentals)\n\nWelcome to the new Web**Fundamentals**! An effort to showcase best practices and tools for modern Web Development.\n\n\n### What's changed?\n\n* We're now using the [DevSite](https://developers.google.com/) infrastructure\n  * New [style guide](https://petele-scratch.appspot.com/web/resources/style-guide)\n  * New [widgets](https://petele-scratch.appspot.com/web/resources/widgets) allow inline JavaScript, common links, related guide and more\n* Jekyll has been eliminated. Instead, pages are rendered at request time\n* Front-matter has been eliminated from the markdown, but files now require a [simple set of tags](https://petele-scratch.appspot.com/web/resources/writing-an-article#yaml-front-matter)\n\n### What stays the same?\n\n* GitHub is still our source of truth for content,\n* We want your contributions, either PRs, issues, whatever!\n* The latest is staged at https://web-central.appspot.com/web/\n\n## Cloning the repo\nIf you have a high-bandwidth connection, I recommend starting with a fresh clone\nof the repo.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/google/WebFundamentals.git\n```\n\n## Getting set up\nThe new DevSite infrastructure simplifies the dependencies a lot. Ensure\nyou have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 10 or greater, and the\n[AppEngine SDK for Python](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python)\nalready installed.\n\n1. Run `npm install` (needed for the build process)\n\n## Build the auto-generated files\nSome files (contributors includes, some pages for updates, showcases, etc.) are\nautomatically generated. The first time you clone the repo and run `npm install`,\nthis is done for you. However, when you add a case study, update, etc., you'll\nneed to re-build those files using:\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## Start Local Server\n\nTo view the site locally, just run:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\n**Note:** The first time you start the server, you may need to run\n`start-appengine.sh` and answer any prompts provided by `dev_appserver.py`.\n\n## Update the code labs\nTo update the Code Labs, you'll need the\n[`claat`](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/tree/master/claat) tool and\naccess to the original Doc files. This will likely only work for Googlers.\n\n1. Download the `claat` tool and place it in your `tools` directory\n1. Run `tools/update-codelabs.sh`\n1. Check the latest changes into GitHub\n\n## Start the development server\n1. Run `npm start`\n\n## Test your changes before submitting a PR\nPlease run your changes through npm test before submitting a PR. The test\nlooks for things that may cause issues with DevSite and tries to keep our\ncontent consistent. It's part of the deployment process, so PRs will fail\nif there are any errors! To run:\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n"
