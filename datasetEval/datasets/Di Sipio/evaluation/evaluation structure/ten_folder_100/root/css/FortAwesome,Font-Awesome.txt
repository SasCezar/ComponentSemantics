For more details see our\n[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included\nare directions for opening issues.\n\n## Versioning\n\nFont Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered\nwith the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.\n\n**The major version "5" is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore\nwe deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**\n\n* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing\n  icon\n* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks\n  backward compatibility\n* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will\n  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md\n* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons\n* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward\n  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases\n\n## License\n\nFont Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly.
