Then just add the class name of the effect to the element you\'d like it applied to.\n\n### A. Copy and Paste an Effect\nIf you plan on only using one or several effects, it\'s better practice to copy and paste an effect into your own stylesheet, so a user doesn\'t have to download `css/hover.css` in its entirety.\n\nAssuming you want to use the Grow effect:\n\n1. Download Hover.css\n2. In `css/hover.css`, find the Grow CSS (each effect is named using a comment above it):\n\n    ```css\n    /* Grow */\n    .hvr-grow {\n        display: inline-block;\n        vertical-align: middle;\n        transform: translateZ(0);\n        box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);\n        backface-visibility: hidden;\n        -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n        transition-duration: 0.3s;\n        transition-property: transform;\n    }\n\n    .hvr-grow:hover,\n    .hvr-grow:focus,\n    .hvr-grow:active {\n        transform: scale(1.1);\n    }\n    ```\n3. Copy this effect and then paste it into your own stylesheet.\n4. In the HTML file which you\'d like the effect to appear, add the class of `.hvr-grow` to your chosen element.\n\nExample element before applying Hover.css effect:\n\n```html\n<a href="#">Add to Basket</a>\n```\n\nExample element after applying Hover.css effect:\n\n```html\n<a href="#" class="hvr-grow">Add to Basket</a>\n```\n\n**Note**: As of `2.0.0` all Hover.css class names are prefixed with `hvr-` to prevent conflicts with other libraries/stylesheets. If using Sass/LESS, this can easily be changed using the `$nameSpace`/`@nameSpace` variable in `scss/_options.scss` or `less/_options.less`.\n\n### B. Reference Hover.css\n\nIf you plan on using many Hover.css effects, you may like to reference the entire Hover.css stylesheet.\n\n1. Download `hover-min.css`\n2. Add `hover-min.css` to your websites files, in a directory named `css` for example\n3. Reference `hover-min.css` in `<head>` of the HTML page you\'d like to add Hover.css effects to:\n```html\n<head>\n\t<link href="css/hover-min.css" rel="stylesheet">\n</head>\n```\nAlternatively you can add a reference into an existing stylesheet like so (this may be useful to WordPress users who are unable to edit HTML):\n```css\n@import url("hover-min.css");\n```\n4. Assuming you want to use the Grow effect, in the HTML file you\'d like to use this effect, add the class of `.hvr-grow` to your chosen element.\n\nExample element before applying Hover.css effect:\n\n```html\n<a href="#" class="button">Add to Basket</a>\n```\n\nExample element after applying Hover.css effect:\n\n```html\n<a href="#" class="button hvr-grow">Add to Basket</a>\n```\n\n### A Note on the `display` Property\n\nTo make an element "transformable", Hover.css  gives the following to all elements it is applied to:\n\n```css\ndisplay: inline-block;\nvertical-align: middle;\n```\n\nShould you wish to override this behavior, either remove the above CSS from Hover.css or change the `display` property for the element. Be sure to declare the override after the Hover.css declarations so the CSS cascade will take effect. Alternatively, if you are using the Sass/LESS version of Hover.css, you can remove/comment out the `forceBlockLevel()` mixin found in `scss/_hacks.scss` or `less/_hacks.less`.\n\nFor more information about Transformable elements, see the [CSS Transforms Module](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/#transformable-element).\n\n### Using Icon Effects\n\nTo add a Hover.css icon, place the icon HTML inside the element that a Hover.css effect is applied to. For example:\n\n```\n<a href="#" class="hvr-icon-forward">\n  Icon Forward\n  <i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right hvr-icon"></i>\n</a>\n```\n\nIn the above code, we have given a link element a class of `hvr-icon-forward` which will make an icon move forward when the link is hovered over. The icon itself is given a class of `hvr-icon` to let Hover.css know that this is the icon we want to animate. In this example, our icon is from FontAwesome, which we\'ve loaded into the `<head></head>` of our web page as per FontAwesome\'s instructions, like so:\n\n```html\n<link href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.2.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="all">\n```\n\nNote: As of Hover.css v2.3.0 you can use any method you like for adding icons (previously, only FontAwesome was supported out-of-the-box.) For example, you could use another icon library or instead, use an image like so:\n\n```\n<a href="#" class="hvr-icon-spin">\n  Icon Spin\n  <img src="myicon.svg" class="hvr-icon" />\n</a>\n```\n\nHere, the image will act as the icon because it has the `hvr-icon` class applied to it, and when hovered over, the icon will spin as defined by the `hvr-icon-spin` class on the parent element.\n\nPosition of the icon is entirely in your control. You could place it before the text, like so:\n\n```\n<a href="#" class="hvr-icon-spin">\n  <img src="myicon.svg" class="hvr-icon" />\n  Icon Spin\n</a>\n```\n\nOr use custom CSS to position the icon as you see fit.\n\n## What\'s Included?\n\nThe project consists of the following folders and files:\n\n### css\n\n- **demo-page.css** - Contains styles to demonstrate Hover. Not required in your projects\n- **hover-min.css** - The minified/production version of Hover.css\n- **hover.css** - The development version of Hover.css\n\n### scss/less\n\n- **effects** - Contains each individual effect sorted into categorized folders\n- **_hacks.scss/_hacks.less, _mixins.scss/_mixins.less, _options.scss/_options.less** - Sass/LESS Utilities\n- **hover.scss/hover.less** - Development version of Hover.css in Sass and LESS flavours\n\n### Other\n\nOther files of note include:\n\n- **index.html** - Demonstrates all Hover.css effects\n- **Gruntfile.js** - Used for [development of Hover.css via Grunt](#using-grunt-for-development).\n\n## Browser Support\nMany Hover.css effects rely on CSS3 features such as transitions, animations, transforms and pseudo-elements, for that reason, effects may not fully work in older browsers.\n\n- [Transitions](http://caniuse.com/#search=transitions) and [Animations](http://caniuse.com/#search=animations) - not supported below Internet Explorer 10\n- [Transforms](http://caniuse.com/#search=transforms) - not supported below Internet Explorer 9\n- [Generated Content (pseudo-elements)](http://caniuse.com/#search=pseudo-elements) - not supported below Internet Explorer 8\n\nAside from the above mentioned browsers, Hover.css is supported across all major browsers. Please see [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/) for full support for many web technologies and test your webpages accordingly. It is recommended to apply fallback effects for older browsers, using CSS supported by those browsers or a feature testing library such as [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/).\n\n## Using Grunt for Development\n\nGrunt is non-essential but can speed up development. With [Grunt installed](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), run `grunt` from the command line to set up a development server accessed at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) or your local IP for network testing. With Grunt running, Sass or LESS will be preprocessed (depending on whether you work out of the `scss` or `less` folder) and CSS files will be minified.\n\n**Note:** Originally Grunt was set up to autoprefix CSS properties but to make the project as accessible as possible, this is no longer the case. The `prefixed(property, value)` Sass/LESS mixin should be used for browser prefixing instead. See [Using Sass/LESS for Development](#using-sassless-for-development) and [Using LESS for Development].\n\n## Using Sass/LESS for Development\n\nSass/LESS are non-essential but can speed up development. Preprocess Sass/LESS with your favourite software or the environment provided via [Grunt](#using-grunt-for-development).\n\nSass/LESS is used in the Hover.css project to separate various CSS into specific files. Each effect is within its own file in the `effects` directory. Hover.css also uses the following `.scss` and `.less` files:\n\n### _hacks\nContains hacks (undesirable but usually necessary lines of code) applied to certain effects. [Hacks explained here](https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover/wiki/Hacks-Explained).\n\n### _mixins\nContains `prefixed` and `keyframes` mixins that apply the necessary prefixes you specify in `_options.scss` / `_options.less` to properties and keyframes.\n\nProperties can be prefixed like so:\n\n- Sass:\n```css\n@include prefixed(transition-duration, .3s);\n```\n- LESS:\n```css\n.prefixed(transition-duration, .3s);\n```\n\nThe `prefixed` mixin is passed the property you want to prefix, followed by its value.\n\nKeyframes can be prefixed like so:\n\n- Sass:\n```css\n@include keyframes(my-animation) {\n    to {\n        color: red;\n    }\n}\n```\nThe `keyframes` mixin is passed the keyframe name, followed by the content using the @content directive.\n\n\n- LESS:\n```css\n.keyframes(my-animation, {\n    to {\n        color: red;\n    }\n});\n```\nThe `keyframes` mixin is passed the keyframe name, followed by the content, both as arguments.\n\n\n### _options\nContains default options, various effect options and the browser prefixes you\'d like to use with the `prefixed` mixin. By default, only the `-webkit-` prefix is set to `true` (due to most browsers not requiring prefixes now).\n\nAs of `2.0.0`, `_options` also includes a `$nameSpace` / `@nameSpace` option which allows you to change the name all classes are prefixed with. The default namespace is `hvr`.\n\nThe `$includeClasses` / `@includeClasses` option by default is set to `true` and will generate all Hover.css effects under their own class names, `hvr-grow` for example. Should you wish to add the properties that make up Hover.css effects to your own class names, set this option to `false`.\n\n## Contribute to Hover.css\n\nIf you\'d like to contribute your own effects, please see the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Licenses\n\nHover.css is made available under a free personal/open source or paid commercial licenses depending on your requirements.
