Among the existing resources, probably the most helpful question bank would be [Front-end Developer Interview Questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions). Unfortunately, I couldn\'t find many complete and satisfactory answers to these questions online, hence here is my attempt at answering them. Being an open source repository, the project can live on with the support of the community as the state of web evolves.\n\n\n---\n\n<div align="center">\n  <strong>\xf0\x9f\x92\xb0 Interested in Front End Dev jobs?

It is pretty much still WIP but I intend to make it into a library that is able to be used in production and also a reference resource for revising Data Structures and Algorithms.\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nWe have adopted the same Code of Conduct as Facebook that we expect project participants to adhere to.
