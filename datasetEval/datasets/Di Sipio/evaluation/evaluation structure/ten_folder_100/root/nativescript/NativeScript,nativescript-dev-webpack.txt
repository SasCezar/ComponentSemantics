b'# NativeScript Webpack\n\nThis repository contains the code for the nativescript-dev-webpack plugin which helps in webpacking [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) apps.\n\nJavaScript code and general asset bundling have been a member of the web developer toolbox for a long time. Tools like Webpack have been providing support for an enjoyable development experience that lets you assemble client-side code from various module sources and formats and then package it together. Most importantly, they allow for page load time optimizations that reduce or parallelize the number of requests a browser makes to the server.\n\nWhy bundle scripts in a mobile app though? \n\n- Fewer filesystem operations on app startup\n- Smaller code size\n- Tree-shaking\n- Preprocessing and interoperability hooks. Webpack provides a way to resolve modules and expressions differently according to its configuration. It also contains a lot of plugins and loaders that let you embed different content in your application or use code written in different programming languages\n\nFor more details, see the [NativeScript docs for building with webpack](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/best-practices/bundling-with-webpack.html).\n\n<!-- TOC depthFrom:2 -->\n\n- [Ingredients](#ingredients)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Contribute](#contribute)\n- [Get Help](#get-help)\n\n<!-- /TOC -->\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* webpack config templates.\n* helper functions that place files at the correct locations before packaging apps.\n* loaders and plugins for vanilla NativeScript and Angular apps.\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save-dev nativescript-dev-webpack\n\n$ tns run android\nor\n$ tns run ios\n```\n\n## Contribute\nWe love PRs!
