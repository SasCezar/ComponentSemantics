My thinking (hope) is driven by\nthe adage _if everything begins in the house, then (perhaps) the "house always wins"._ At the same time, to\nlearn _anything_, I am someone who has to build _something_.  The link:scripts/fiddle.sh[fiddle.sh] script is that thing.\nEssentially, it is Command Line Interface (CLI) for quickly getting started with over 25 different languages and\nlibraries.  At present, it can be used to create a localized sandbox (aka _fiddle_) for any of the following languages\nand frameworks:\n\n\n[width="90%",cols="m,m,m,m"]\n|=========================================================\n|link:fiddles/android[Android]\n|link:fiddles/angular[Angular 1.5]\n|link:fiddles/angular2-cli[Angular Cli]\n|link:fiddles/ant[Ant]\n|link:fiddles/aws/readme.adoc[AWS]\n|link:fiddles/bash[Bash]\n|link:fiddles/c[C]\n|link:fiddles/chef[Chef]\n|link:fiddles/chrome[Chrome]\n|link:fiddles/compass[Compass]\n|link:fiddles/d3[D3]\n|link:fiddles/docker[Docker]\n|link:fiddles/dojo[Dojo]\n|link:fiddles/electron[Electron]\n|link:fiddles/ember[Ember]\n|link:fiddles/extjs5[ExtJS 5]\n|link:fiddles/extjs6[ExtJS 6]\n|link:fiddles/java[Java EE]\n|link:fiddles/javac[Java]\n|link:fiddles/jquery[Jquery / ES6]\n|link:fiddles/meteor[Meteor]\n|link:fiddles/nativeScript[NativeScript]\n|link:fiddles/node[Node]\n|link:fiddles/php[PHP]\n|link:fiddles/python[Python]\n|link:fiddles/react[React]\n|link:fiddles/rxjs[RxJS]\n|link:fiddles/svg[SVG]\n|link:fiddles/three[Three.js]\n|link:fiddles/tween[Tween.js]\n|=========================================================\n\nTo get started, with any of the frameworks listed, use the above links to explore the associated collection.
