However if your project goals are to target multiple platforms (web, native mobile and native desktop), with powerful out of the box library support and highly configurable/flexible testing options, then you might want to keep reading.\n\nAdditionally, this seed is intended to push a couple boundaries so if you see dependencies that are *bleeding edge*, this is intentional.\n\n# Getting Started\n### Dependencies\n\n* node v5.x.x or higher and npm 3 or higher.\n\n* To run the NativeScript app:\n\n```\nnpm install -g nativescript\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/JonnyBGod/angular2-webpack-advance-starter.git\ncd angular2-seed-advanced\n\n# install the project\'s dependencies\nnpm install or yarn install\n\n# start the server\nnpm start\n\n# use Hot Module Replacement\nnpm run start:hmr\n```\n\n### Other commands\n\n#### build files\n```bash\n# development\nnpm run build:dev\n# production (jit)\nnpm run build:prod\n# AoT\nnpm run build:aot\n```\n\n#### hot module replacement\n```bash\nnpm run server:dev:hmr\n```\n\n#### watch and build files\n```bash\nnpm run watch\n```\n\n#### run unit tests\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\n\n#### watch and run our tests\n```bash\nnpm run watch:test\n```\n\n#### run end-to-end tests\n```bash\n# this will start a test server and launch Protractor\nnpm run e2e\n```\n\n### continuous integration (run unit tests and e2e tests together)\n```bash\n# this will test both your JIT and AoT builds\nnpm run ci\n```\n\n#### run webdriver (for end-to-end)\n```bash\nnpm run webdriver:update\nnpm run webdriver:start\n```\n\n#### run Protractor\'s elementExplorer (for end-to-end)\n```bash\nnpm run webdriver:start\n# in another terminal\nnpm run e2e:live\n```\n\n#### generate docs\n```bash\nnpm run docs\n```\n\n#### build Docker\n```bash\nnpm run build:docker\n```\n\n### Electron App\n\n#### Develop\n\n```\nMac:      npm run start:desktop\nWindows:  npm run start:desktop:windows\n```\n\n#### Build: Electron App for Mac, Windows or Linux for distribution\n\n```\nMac:      npm run build:desktop:mac\nWindows:  npm run build:desktop:windows\nLinux:    npm run build:desktop:linux\n\nAll:      npm run build:desktop\n```\n\n## Framework How-Tos\n\n### i18n\n\n* how to add a language?\n  - `src/assets/i18n/`\n    - add `[language code].json` (copy existing one and adapt the translation strings)\n  - `src/client/app.config.json`\n    - add language to `availableLanguages`\n  - `src/app/frameworks/i18n/components/lang-switcher.component.spec.ts`\n    - fix test\n\n## Change Detection OnPush Note\n\n*Please Note:* The seed uses Angular\'s `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` by default which requires some understanding of immutability and one-way data flows. Please check out the following resources to learn more:\n\n* http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/02/22/angular-2-change-detection-explained.html\n* http://victorsavkin.com/post/110170125256/change-detection-in-angular-2\n* http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/viewarticle/change-detection-in-angular-2.0\n* http://ngcourse.rangle.io/handout/change-detection/change_detection_strategy_onpush.html\n\nIf you experience issues with changes not occuring in your views, you can disable this by commenting out [these lines](https://github.com/JonnyBGod/angular2-webpack-advance-starter/blob/master/src/app/frameworks/core/decorators/utils.ts#L43-L48). The seed uses `OnPush` by default because it  provides optimal performance and if you decide to turn it off while developing your application, you can always turn it back on when you\'re ready to refactor your data services to utilize `OnPush` properly.\n\n## General Best Practice Guide to Sharing Code \n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s actually only a few things to keep in mind when sharing code between web/mobile. The seed does take care of quite a few of those things but here\xe2\x80\x99s a brief list:\n\n* Don\xe2\x80\x99t import {N} modules into your components/services. {N} modules can only be used inside the {N} app therefore cannot be shared. To get around this, use `OpaqueTokens` which is a fancy name for something quite simple. [Learn more here](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/05/23/opaque-tokens-in-angular-2.html). A great example of how to integrate 2 different plugins (1 for web, 1 for {N}) and share all the code exists in [this wiki article: How to integrate Firebase across all platforms](https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular2-seed-advanced/wiki/How-to-integrate-Firebase-across-all-platforms-(web-nativescript-desktop)) written by the awesome [Scott Lowe](https://twitter.com/scott_d_lowe).\n* Use the conditional hooks provided by the seed in shared methods where you may need to handle something differently in {N} than you do on the web. For example, see [here](https://github.com/JonnyBGod/angular2-webpack-advance-starter/blob/master/src/app/frameworks/i18n/components/lang-switcher.component.ts#L35-L41).\n* Don\xe2\x80\x99t use window global. Inject the `WindowService` provided by the seed instead. This includes usage of `alert`, `confirm`, etc. For example:\n\nIf you were thinking about doing: `alert(\'Something happened!\');`, *Don\'t*.\nInstead inject `WindowService`:\n```\nconstructor(private win: WindowService) {}\n\npublic userAction() {\n  if (success) {\n    // do stuff\n  } else {\n    this.win.alert(\'Something happened!\');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that when the same code is run in the {N} app, the native `dialogs` module will be used.\n\n* Lastly, understand this video: http://www.nativescriptsnacks.com/videos/2016/06/13/zoned-callbacks.html \xe2\x80\xa6 As far as dealing with {N} and 3rd party plugins, you want to understand that.\n\nThe advice [Nathan Walker\'s](https://github.com/NathanWalker) likes to give, and I fully support it, is:\n\n> Code with web mentality first. Then provide the native capability using Angular\xe2\x80\x99s `{provide: SomeWebService, useClass: SomeNativeService }` during bootstrap.\n\nThere are some cases where you may want to use `useValue` vs. `useClass`, and other times may need to use `useFactory`. Read [the Angular docs here to learn more about which you may need for your use case](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/dependency-injection.html#!#provide).\n\n## How best to use for your project\n\n#### Setup\n\n*NOTE*: This should be done first before you start making any changes and building out your project. Not doing so will likely result in dificulty when trying to merge in upstream changes later.\n\n1. Download a zip of the seed. (**Do not fork**)\n2. `npm run git.setup` - This will initialize `git` as well as setup `upstream` properly.\n3. `git remote add origin ...your private repo...`\n4. `npm run git.prepare` - This will prepare git to handle the merge\n5. `npm run git.merge` - This will fetch upstream and run the first merge (*Important)\n  * IMPORTANT: You will see a wall of Conflicts after doing above (a Conflict for every single file). This is normal. There actually will not be any problematic conflicts as it\'s just reporting every single file which both sides (`upstream` and your first commit) added.\n6. `git add .; git commit -m\'ready\'`. **Yes**, you will be committing all those conflicts, which actually are not a problem in this 1 time case.\n7. Now you have `git` setup and ready to develop your application as well as merge in upstream changes in the future.\n8. `npm install` (and all other usage docs in this `README` apply)\n9. Create a new `framework` for your application in `src/app/frameworks` to build your codebase out. Say your app is called `AwesomeApp`, then create `awesomeapp` and start building out all your components and services in there. Create other frameworks as you see fit to organize.\n10. If you don\'t want an integration that comes out of box with this seed; for example. let\'s say you don\'t want to use i18n. Then just delete the `i18n`, remove `ng2-translate` as dependency root `package.json` and `nativescript/package.json`. Then remove any references to `i18n` throughout.\n\n#### Merging latest upstream changes\n\n1. `npm run git:merge:preview` - This will fetch `upstream` and show you how the merge would look\n2. `npm run git:merge` - This will actually do the merge\n3. Handle any conflicts to get latest upstream into your application.\n4. Continue building your app.\n\nYou can read more about [syncing a fork here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).\n\nIf you have any suggestions to this workflow, please post [here](https://github.com/JonnyBGod/angular2-webpack-advance-starter/issues).\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguration files live in `config/` we are currently using webpack, karma, and protractor for different stages of your application.\n\nUse `config/custom/` configuration files when possible to add your custom configurations or override our configurations. This will help you when updating upstream.\n\n# AoT  Don\'ts\nThe following are some things that will make AoT compile fail.\n\n- Don\xe2\x80\x99t use require statements for your templates or styles, use styleUrls and templateUrls, the angular2-template-loader plugin will change it to require at build time.\n- Don\xe2\x80\x99t use default exports.\n- Don\xe2\x80\x99t use form.controls.controlName, use form.get(\xe2\x80\x98controlName\xe2\x80\x99)\n- Don\xe2\x80\x99t use control.errors?.someError, use control.hasError(\xe2\x80\x98someError\xe2\x80\x99)\n- Don\xe2\x80\x99t use functions in your providers, routes or declarations, export a function and then reference that function name\n- Inputs, Outputs, View or Content Child(ren), Hostbindings, and any field you use from the template or annotate for Angular should be public\n\n## More Documentation\n\n[angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter)\n\n[angular2-seed-advanced](https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular2-seed-advanced)\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/JonnyBGod/angular2-webpack-advance-starter/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](https://github.com/JonnyBGod/angular2-webpack-advance-starter/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) files for guidelines.\n\n___\n\n# License\n [MIT](/LICENSE)'
