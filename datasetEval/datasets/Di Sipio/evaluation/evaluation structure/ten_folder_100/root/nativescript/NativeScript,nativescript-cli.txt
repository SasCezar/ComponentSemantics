The framework provides JavaScript access to the native APIs, user interface, and rendering engines of iOS and Android. By using JavaScript or TypeScript, you can create one project that builds into an iOS or Android app with completely native user experience.\n\nTo learn more about NativeScript, you can check the following resources:\n\n* [The NativeScript web page][4]\n* [NativeScript - a Technical Overview][9]\n* [Development with NativeScript][3]\n* [Announcing NativeScript - cross-platform framework for building native mobile applications][11]\n* The NativeScript [Documentation repo][6] and [Documentation portal][7]\n* [The NativeScript FAQ][8]\n* [On NativeScript for Android][10]\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\nHow the NativeScript CLI works\n===\n\nThe NativeScript CLI is the command-line interface for interacting with NativeScript. It incorporates several important services. Consider the following diagram:\n\n![NativeScript CLI diagram](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/raw/release/ns-cli.png)\n\n* **Commands** - pretty much what every CLI does - support of different command options, input validation and help  \n* **Devices Service** - provides the communication between NativeScript and devices/emulators/simulators used to run/debug the app. Uses iTunes to talk to iOS and adb for Android\n* **LiveSync Service** - redeploys applications when code changes during development\n* **Hooks Service** - executes custom-written hooks in developed application, thus modifying the build process\n* **Platforms Service** - provides app build functionalities, uses Gradle to build Android packages and Xcode for iOS. \n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\nSupported Platforms\n===\n\nWith the NativeScript CLI, you can target the following mobile platforms.\n\n* Android 4.2 or a later stable official release\n* iOS 7.0 or later stable official release\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\nSystem Requirements\n===\n\nYou can install and run the NativeScript CLI on Windows, macOS or Linux.\n\n* [Windows](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-win)\n* [macOS](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-os-x)\n* [Linux](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-linux)\n\nInstallation\n===\n\n## Install the NativeScript CLI\n\nThe NativeScript CLI is available for installing as an npm package.\n\nIn the command prompt, run the following command.\n\nOS | Node.js installed from http://nodejs.org/ | Node.js installed via package manager\n---|---------------------|----\nWindows | `npm install nativescript -g` | `npm install nativescript -g`\nmacOS | `sudo npm install nativescript -g --unsafe-perm` | `npm install nativescript -g`\nLinux | `sudo npm install nativescript -g --unsafe-perm` | `npm install nativescript -g`\n\nTo check if your system is configured properly, run the following command.\n\n```Shell\ntns doctor\n```\n\n## Configure Proxy Settings\n\nIf you are working with the NativeScript CLI behind a web proxy, you need to configure your proxy settings.\n\n### Set Proxy Settings\n\n```Shell\ntns proxy set <Url> <Username> <Password>\n```\n\n#### Attributes\n\n<details><summary><code>&lt;Url&gt;</code></summary>\n<strong>(Required)</strong> The full URL of the proxy. The <code>&lt;Url&gt;</code> attribute is required and if you do not provide it when running the command, the NativeScript CLI will prompt you to provide it. An example of a valid proxy URL is <code>http://127.0.0.1:8888</code>.</details>\n \n<details><summary><code>&lt;Username&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Password&gt;</code></summary>\n<strong>(Optional)</strong> The credentials for the proxy. The <code>&lt;Username&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Password&gt;</code> attributes are optional, however, if you choose to provide them, you must provide both.</details> \n\n#### Options\n\n<details><summary><code>--insecure</code></summary>\nThe <code>--insecure</code> flag allows you to perform insecure SSL connections and transfers. This option is useful when your proxy does not have a CA certificate or the certificate is no longer valid.</details>\n\n#### Limitations\n\n* You can provide the `<Username>` and `<Password>` attributes only on Windows systems.\n* Proxy settings for the npm, the Android Gradle and (optional) Docker need to be configured separately. For more information, see the following articles:\n\t* [Configure the npm proxy](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#https-proxy)\n\t* [Configure the Android Gradle proxy](https://docs.gradle.org/3.3/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:accessing_the_web_via_a_proxy)\n    * [Configure the Docker proxy](https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/)\n\n### Display Current Proxy Settings\n\n```Shell\ntns proxy\n```\n\n### Clear Proxy Settings\n\n```Shell\ntns proxy clear\n```\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\nQuick Start\n===\n\n* [The Commands](#the-commands)\n* [Create Project](#create-project)\n* [Add Platforms](#add-platforms)\n* [Develop Your Project](#develop-your-project)\n* [Prepare for Build](#prepare-for-build)\n* [Build Your Project](#build-your-project)\n* [Deploy Your Project](#deploy-your-project)\n* [Run Your Project](#run-your-project)\n\n## The Commands\n\nRun `tns help` to view all available commands in the browser. Run `tns help <Command>` to view more information about a selected command in the browser. `tns --help` opens console help, where help information is shown in the console.\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\n## Create Project\n\nTo create a new cross-platform project from the default JavaScript template, run the following command.\n\n```Shell\ntns create MyApp\n```\n\nTo create a new cross-platform project from the default TypeScript or Angular template, use the `template` option followed by either `typescript`, or `angular`.\n\n```Shell\ntns create MyApp --template typescript\ntns create MyApp --template angular\n```\n\nOr you can simply use the shorthand `tsc` and `ng` options.\n\n```Shell\ntns create MyApp --tsc\ntns create MyApp --ng\n```\nWith the `template` option you can also specify a local or a remote path to the template that you want to use to create your project.\nFor example, if you want to use the nightly build of the default JavaScript template, run the following command.\n\n```Shell\ntns create MyApp --template https://github.com/NativeScript/template-hello-world.git\n```\n\nTo create a new cross-platform project from an existing NativeScript project, run the following command.\n\n```Shell\ntns create MyApp --copy-from <Directory>\n```\n\nWhere `<Directory>` is the complete path to the directory that contains your existing project. You can use any NativeScript project, created with the Telerik AppBuilder clients.\n\nThe NativeScript CLI creates a new project and sets the application identifier to `org.nativescript.myapp`.\n\nThe CLI places the project in a new directory in the current directory. The newly created directory has the following structure.\n\n```\nMyApp/\n\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 app\n\xe2\x94\x82   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 app.css\n\xe2\x94\x82   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 app.js\n\xe2\x94\x82   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 bootstrap.js\n\xe2\x94\x82   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 main-page.js\n\xe2\x94\x82   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 main-page.xml\n\xe2\x94\x82   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 App_Resources\n\xe2\x94\x82   \xe2\x94\x82   \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 ...\n\xe2\x94\x82   \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 tns_modules\n\xe2\x94\x82       \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 ...\n\xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 platforms\n    \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 ...\n```\n\n* The `app` directory is the **development space for your application**. You should modify all common and platform-specific code within this directory. When you run `prepare <Platform>`, the NativeScript CLI copies relevant content to the platform-specific folders for each target platform.\n* The `platforms` directory is created empty. When you add a target platform to your project, the NativeScript CLI creates a new subdirectory with the platform name. The subdirectory contains the ready-to-build resources of your app. When you run `prepare <Platform>`, the NativeScript CLI copies relevant content from the `app` directory to the platform-specific subdirectory for each target platform.\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\n## Add Platforms\n\nAfter you have created your project, you can start adding target platforms to it. To be able to build your project into an application package for a selected target platform, you need to add the platform to your project first. Currently, you can target Android and iOS with your NativeScript projects.\n\nNavigate to the directory that contains your newly created project and run the following commands.\n\n```Shell\ntns platform add android\ntns platform add ios\n```\n\n`platform add` creates the `android` and the `ios` subdirectories in the `platforms` directory. These subdirectories have the platform-specific project structure required for native development with the native SDKs for the platform.\n\n```\n...\nplatforms/\n|-- android/\n|-- |-- assets/\n|-- |-- gen/\n|-- |-- libs/\n|-- |-- node_modules/\n|-- |-- res/\n|-- |-- src/\n|-- |-- .project\n|-- |-- AndroidManifest.xml\n|-- |-- build.xml\n|-- |-- local.properties\n|-- |-- proguard-project.txt\n|-- `-- project.properties\n|-- ios/\n|-- |-- libTNSBridge.a\n|-- |-- node_modules\n`-- |-- MyApp/\n    `-- MyApp.xcodeproj\n...\n```\n\nFor more information about the structure of Android native projects, see [Android Projects](http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html#ApplicationProjects).\n\nFor more information about the structure of iOS native projects, see [Code Organization in Xcode Projects](http://akosma.com/2009/07/28/code-organization-in-xcode-projects/).\n\n> **TIP:** The NativeScript team provides experimental support for the latest versions of iOS and Android. You can choose which platform runtime to use in your project by running `tns platform add <platform>@<Version>`<br/>To list all available versions for android, run $ npm view tns-android versions<br/>To list only experimental versions for android, run $ npm view tns-android dist-tags\nTo list all available versions for ios, run $ npm view tns-ios versions<br/>To list only experimental versions for ios, run $ npm view tns-ios dist-tags\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\n## Develop Your Project\n\n* [Development with NativeScript](#development-with-nativescript)\n* [Development in app](#development-in-app)\n* [Development in platforms](#development-in-platforms)\n\n### Development with NativeScript\n\nFor more information about working with NativeScript, see the following resources.\n\n* [The NativeScript Documentation Wiki][6]\n* [The NativeScript API Reference][7]\n\n### Development in `app`\n\nThe `app` directory in the root of the project is the development space for your project. **Place all your common and platform-specific code in this directory.** When you run `prepare <Platform>`, the NativeScript CLI copies relevant content to the platform-specific folders for each target platform.\n\nIn the `app` directory, you can use **platform-specific files** to provide customized functionality and design for each target platform. To indicate that a file is platform-specific, make sure that the file name is in the following format: `name.ios.extension` or `name.android.extension`. For example: `main.ios.js` or `main.android.js`.\n\nYou can develop shared functionality or design in common files. To indicate that a file is common, make sure that the file name does not contain a `.android.` or `.ios.` string.\n\n### Development in `platforms`\n\n> **IMPORTANT:** Avoid editing files located in the `platforms` subdirectory because the NativeScript CLI overrides such files during the `prepare <Platform>` using the contents of the `app` directory.\n\n### Modifying Configuration Files\n\nThe NativeScript CLI respects any platform configuration files placed inside `app/App_Resources`. Those files are respectively `app/App_Resources/AndroidManifest.xml` for Android and `app/App_Resources/Info.plist` for iOS.\n\nAdditionaly, you can modify `app/App_Resources/build.xcconfig` and `app/App_Resources/app.gradle` for adding/removing additional build properties for iOS and Android, respectively.\n\n### Modifying Entitlements File (iOS only)\n\nTo specify which Capabilities are required by your App - Maps, Push Notifications, Wallet and etc. you can add or edit the `app.entitlements` file placed inside `app/App_Resources/iOS`. When building the project, the default `app/App_Resources/iOS/app.entitlements` file gets merged with all Plugins entitlement files and a new `yourAppName.entitlements` is created in the platforms directory. The path would be `app/platforms/ios/<application name>/<application name>.entitlements` and will be linked in the `build.xcconfig` file.\n\nYou can always override the generated entitlements file, by pointing to your own entitlements file by setting the `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` property in the `app/App_Resources/iOS/build.xcconfig` file.\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\n## Prepare for Build\n\nWhen you run `build`, the NativeScript CLI uses the resources from the platform-specific subdirectory in the `platforms` directory. To populate the platform-specific subdirectory with the correct application assets, you need to run `prepare`.\n\n```Shell\ntns prepare android\ntns prepare ios\n```\n\n`prepare <Platform>` takes content from `app`, analyzes it and copies it to the platform-specific subdirectory in `platforms`. This operation copies common and relevant platform-specific content that applies to the selected platform. This ensures that your Android or iOS application contain only the correct assets.\n\nKeep in mind that `prepare` overrides changes made to the platform-specific subdirectory in `platforms`. For more information, see [Development in platforms](#development-in-platforms).\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\n## Build Your Project\n\nAfter you have prepared your project, you can build it for your target mobile platforms.\n\n```Shell\ntns build android\ntns build ios\n```\n\nThe NativeScript CLI calls the SDK for the selected target platform and uses it to build your app locally.\n\nWhen you build for Android, the NativeScript CLI saves the application package as an `APK` in `platforms` &#8594; `android` &#8594; `bin`.\n\nWhen you build for iOS, the NativeScript CLI will either build for a device, if there\'s a device attached, or for the native emulator if there are no devices attached. To trigger a native emulator build when a device is attached, set the `--emulator` flag.\n\nThe native emulator build is saved as an `APP` in `platforms` &#8594; `ios` &#8594; `build` &#8594; `emulator`. The device build is saved as an `IPA` in `platforms` &#8594; `ios` &#8594; `build` &#8594; `device`.\n\n> **IMPORTANT:** To build your app for an iOS device, you must configure a valid certificate and provisioning profile pair, and have that pair present on your system for code signing your application package. For more information, see [iOS Code Signing - A Complete Walkthrough](http://seventhsoulmountain.blogspot.com/2013/09/ios-code-sign-in-complete-walkthrough.html).\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\n## Deploy Your Project\n\nYou can test your work in progress on connected Android or iOS devices.\n\nTo verify that the NativeScript CLI recognizes your connected devices, run the following command.\n\n```Shell\ntns device\n```\n\nThe NativeScript CLI lists all connected physical devices and running Android Virtual Devices.\n\nAfter you have listed the available devices, you can deploy your app on all devices from the selected target platform.\n\n\n```Shell\ntns deploy android\ntns deploy ios\n```\n\nThe NativeScript CLI calls the SDK for the selected target platform and uses it to build your app locally. After the build is complete, the NativeScript CLI downloads and installs the application package on your connected devices.\n\nOn Android devices, the app runs automatically.\n\nOn iOS devices, the app does not run automatically. To run the app, tap the app icon.\n\n> **IMPORTANT:** To deploy your app on iOS devices, you need to configure a valid pair of certificate and provisioning profile for code signing your application package. For more information, see [iOS Code Signing - A Complete Walkthrough](http://seventhsoulmountain.blogspot.com/2013/09/ios-code-sign-in-complete-walkthrough.html).\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\n## Emulate Your Project\n\nIf you do not have any physical devices on which to test your app or if you have not configured any certificates and provisioning profiles for iOS, you can run your app in the native emulator of your target platform.\n\n```Shell\ntns run android --emulator\ntns run ios --emulator\n```\n\nThis operation calls the SDK for the selected target platform, builds your app locally, launches the native device emulator for the selected target platform, and runs your project on the virtual device.\n\nFor Android, the NativeScript CLI runs your app in the earliest created virtual device or the currently running Android Virtual Device. Before running your app in the Android native emulator, make sure that you have configured at least one virtual device in the Android Virtual Device manager.\n\nFor iOS, the NativeScript CLI runs your app in the iOS Simulator.\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\n## Run Your Project\n\nYou can quickly run your app on connected devices, including all running Android Virtual Devices. The following command is shorthand for `prepare`, `build`, and `deploy`.\n\n```Shell\ntns run android\ntns run ios\n```\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\nExtending the CLI\n===\n\nThe NativeScript CLI lets you extend its behavior and customize it to fit your needs by using [hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking).\n\nWhen you run one of the extendable commands (for example, `tns build`), the CLI checks for hooks and executes them. Plugins can also use hooks to control the compilation of the application package.\n\nFor more information, see the [Extending the CLI document](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/blob/master/extending-cli.md)\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\nTroubleshooting\n===\n\nIf the NativeScript CLI does not behave as expected, you might be facing a configuration issue. For example, a missing `JAVA` path. To check if your system is configured properly for the NativeScript CLI, run the following command.\n\n```bash\ntns doctor\n```\n\nThis command prints warnings about current configuration issues and provides basic information about how to resolve them.\n\nIf addressing the configuration issues does not resolve your problem, you can [report an issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#report-an-issue) or [post in the NativeScript forums](https://discourse.nativescript.org/).\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\nKnown Issues\n===\n\n* You cannot synchronize changes to apps on Android 4.3 devices and on some Samsung devices using the `run android` command.<br/>**Workaround:** Upgrade to a later version of Android to be able to use the `livesync` command. If you need to develop for Android 4.3 devices, re-build and re-deploy your app to get your latest changes on device.\n\n* On macOS systems with configured firewall or web proxy, when you run a command, the operation might not release the command line and you might not be able to run other commands until you break the current operation.<br/>If you have enabled feature usage tracking for the NativeScript CLI, but you have not authenticated with the firewall or web proxy on your macOS system, the NativeScript CLI might not release the command line after you run a command. To continue working with the NativeScript CLI, you need to break the current operation by pressing `Ctrl+C`.<br/>**Workaround:** Authenticate with the firewall or web proxy.\n    1. Close the terminal.\n    1. Run Safari.\n    1. Attempt to open a web page.\n    1. Provide your authentication credentials for accessing the Internet.\n    1. Run the terminal and continue working with the NativeScript CLI.\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\nHow to Contribute\n===\n\nTo learn how to log a bug that you just discovered, click [here](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#report-an-issue).\n\nTo learn how to suggest a new feature or improvement, click [here](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#request-a-feature).\n\nTo learn how to contribute to the code base, click [here](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contribute-to-the-code-base).\n\n[Back to Top][1]\n\nHow to Build\n===\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli\ncd nativescript-cli\nnpm run setup\n```\n\nTo use the locally built CLI instead `tns` you can call `PATH_TO_CLI_FOLDER/bin/tns`.
