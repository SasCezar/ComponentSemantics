For Android 6 (API 23) and above the permissions to read file storage should be explicitly required.

Now the plugin supports some new features, fixes some bugs and has a more native look in iOS. You should remove any dependencies to `nativescript-pro-ui`, `nativescript-ui-listview`, etc. in case you\'ve added them in your app specifically for this plugin. Also the options **fileUri**, **doneText**, **cancelText**, **albumsText**, **newestFirst** and the methods **cancel()** and **done()** are no longer applicable. The image picker now returns the basic [{N} ImageAsset class](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/tree/master/tns-core-modules/image-asset) (and not custom asset as before). If you have been using the `fileUri` property of the returned assets to get a file path in versions prior to 6.x.x, you should refer to the following issue comment for an alternative way to get the path - https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-imagepicker/issues/181#issuecomment-384585293.\n\n## Migrating from 4.x.x to 5.x.x\nWith version **5.x.x** major update to the plugin there is a related dependency which needs to be updated inside your project. The plugin uses internally the `nativescript-ui-listview` plugin (part of the NativeScript Pro UI components). Recently the monolithic [NativeScript Pro UI plugin was split in multiple plugins](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/professional-components-from-nativescript-ui-the-big-breakup), each of them representing a single component. Now, instead of the monolithic package, nativescript-imagepicker uses only the component it needs. To use version 5.x.x of the plugin, you need to update any dependencies to `nativescript-pro-ui` in your project with the single component alternatives as described in the [migration guide](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/nativescript-ui/migration).\n\n## Migrating from 3.x.x to 4.x.x\nWith the **4.x.x** major update to the plugin there is a related dependency which needs to be updated inside your project. The plugin uses internally the `nativescript-pro-ui` plugin (previously known as `nativescript-telerik-ui`) which has bee updated and made 100% free. This means that if your project is using the deprecated `nativescript-telerik-ui`/`pro` plugins adding the latest version of the `nativescript-imagepicker` plugin will cause your project to throw an build error when working with iOS. This is because the `nativescript-imagepicker` has a dependency to the new `nativescript-pro-ui` plugin and when your project also depends on the old `nativescript-telerik-ui` plugin there is a native frameworks collision.\n\nIn order to solve this you simply have to update to the latest `nativescript-pro-ui`, more details on how to migrate from `nativescript-telerik-ui`/`pro` to `nativescript-pro-ui` can be found [here](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/nativescript-ui/migration).\n\n## Usage \n\nThe best way to explore the usage of the plugin is to inspect both demo apps in the plugin repository. \nIn `demo` folder you can find the usage of the plugin for TypeScript non-Angular application. Refer to `demo/app/main-page.ts`.\nIn `demo-angular` is the usage in an Angular app. Refer to `demo-angular/app/app.component.ts`.\n\nIn addition to the plugin usage, both apps are webpack configured.\n\nIn short here are the steps:\n\n### Import the plugin\n\n*TypeScript*\n``` \nimport * as imagepicker from "nativescript-imagepicker";\n```\n\n*Javascript*\n``` \nvar imagepicker = require("nativescript-imagepicker");\n```\n\n### Create imagepicker\n\nCreate imagepicker in `single` or `multiple` mode to specifiy if the imagepicker will be used for single or multiple selection of images\n\n*TypeScript*\n``` \nlet context = imagepicker.create({\n    mode: "single" // use "multiple" for multiple selection\n});\n````\n\n*Javascript*\n````\nvar context = imagepicker.create({ mode: "single" }); // use "multiple" for multiple selection\n````\n\n### Request permissions, show the images list and process the selection\n\n``` \ncontext\n    .authorize()\n    .then(function() {\n        return context.present();\n    })\n    .then(function(selection) {\n        selection.forEach(function(selected) {\n            // process the selected image\n        });\n        list.items = selection;\n    }).catch(function (e) {\n        // process error\n    });\n```\n\n> **NOTE**: To request permissions for Android 6+ (API 23+) we use [nativescript-permissions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-permissions).\n\n> **NOTE**: Using the plugin on iOS requres photo library permission. Your app might be rejected from the Apple App Store if you do not provide a description about why you need this permission. The default message "Requires access to photo library." might not be enough for the App Store reviewers. You can customize it by editing the `app/App_Resources/iOS/Info.plist` file in your app and adding the following key:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Description text goes here</string>\n```\n\n## API\n\n### Methods\n\n* create(options) - creates instance of the imagepicker. Possible options are:\n\n| Option | Platform | Default | Description |\n| --- |  --- | --- | --- |\n| mode | both | multiple | The mode if the imagepicker. Possible values are `single` for single selection and `multiple` for multiple selection. |\n| minimumNumberOfSelection | iOS | 0 | The minumum number of selected assets. |\n| maximumNumberOfSelection | iOS | 0 | The maximum number of selected assets. |\n| showsNumberOfSelectedAssets |  iOS | True | Display the number of selected assets. |\n| prompt | iOS | undefined | Display prompt text when selecting assets. |\n| numberOfColumnsInPortrait | iOS | 4 | Set the number of columns in Portrait orientation. |\n| numberOfColumnsInLandscape | iOS | 7 | Set the number of columns in Landscape orientation. |\n| mediaType | both | Any | Choose whether to pick Image/Video/Any type of assets. |\n| showAdvanced | Android | false | Show internal and removable storage options on Android (**WARNING**: [not supported officially](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/72053350)). |\n\nThe **hostView** parameter can be set to the view that hosts the image picker. Applicable in iOS only, intended to be used when open picker from a modal page.\n\n* authorize() - request the required permissions.\n* present() - show the albums to present the user the ability to select images. Returns an array of the selected images.\n\n## Contribute\nWe love PRs! Check out the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
