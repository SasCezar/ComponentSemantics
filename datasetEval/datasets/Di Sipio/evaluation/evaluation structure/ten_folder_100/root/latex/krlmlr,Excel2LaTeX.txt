b"# Excel2LaTeX\nMaking tables in LaTeX can be tedious, especially if some columns are calculated.\nThis converter allows you to write a table in Excel instead, and export the current selection as LaTeX markup\nwhich can be pasted into an existing LaTeX document, or exported to a file and included via the `\\input` command.\n\nKnown to be compatible with Windows Excel 2000&ndash;2016 (32-bit and 64-bit) and Mac Excel 2004, 2011, and 2016.\nMay also be compatible with other versions that support `.xla` add-ins.\n\n![Excel and Excel2LaTeX comparison](https://i.imgur.com/UNKCihT.png)\n\n## Features\nMost Excel formatting is supported.\n * Bold and italic (if applied to the whole cell)\n * Left, right, center, and general alignment (per-cell or per-column)\n * Vertical and horizontal borders (per-cell or per-column, single or double)\n * Font color (using the `xcolor` package)\n * Fill color (using the `colortbl` package)\n * Rotation (using the `rotating` package)\n * Merged cells (using the `multirow` package, if needed)\n * Can convert `\\`, `$`, `_`, `^`, `%`, `&`, and `#` to appropriate macros, or leave them in-place\n * Supports `booktabs` package\n * Uses `bigstrut` package when `booktabs` is not available\n * Makes standard LaTeX `tabular` environment\n * Can surround `tabular` environment with `table` environment template\n * Copy output to clipboard or export to a `.tex` file for inclusion using `\\include`\n * Save table specifications to your Excel worksheet, then export all tables at once\n\n## Using\nJust open the file Excel2LaTeX.xla in Excel. Then you will have two additional \nmenu items in your **Tools** menu and a new toolbar with two buttons on it. For \nExcel 2007 and later, you will have two new buttons in the **Add-Ins** ribbon. If \nyou plan to use the program frequently, you can save it in your addin directory \nand add it with **Tools**&rarr;**Add-Ins**. This way it will be loaded whenever Excel is \nopened.\n\nSelect the table to convert and hit the button **Convert Table to LaTeX**. You \nwill be given the option to save the result to a `.tex` file, or send it to the clipboard \n(so you can paste it into your LaTeX editor). Hit the **Store** button to store the \ncurrent settings so you can **Load** them later or **Export All** to files.\n\n![Excel2LaTeX interface](https://i.imgur.com/EK88upo.png)\n\n## Contributing\nThe development repository and the bug tracker for this package are hosted on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/krlmlr/Excel2LaTeX).
