It may ask you your password.\n\n\n**Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/Opensuse**\n\nThe scripts `install_debian_ubuntu`, `install_fedora` or `install_opensuse` will ask\nadministrator privileges before launching the installer.\n\nWarning: on Fedora 25 with Wayland, the installation will fail since Wayland forbids graphical applications\nto run in sudo/su mode. See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1274451\nThe workaround consists of installing LaTeXDraw using a X11 sessions, or manually (see below). We will fix that in a next release.\n\n\n**Running the installer**\n\nIf you want to manually launch the installer (i.e. without through a script as explained above)\nin a console, the command is `java -jar installer.jar` (but you must have admin rights).\n\nThe shared templates are located in the following folder:\n - for Unix, `/usr/share/latexdraw`\n - for Mac OS X, `/Users/Shared/latexdraw`\n - for Vista, `ProgramData\\latexdraw`\n - for other Windows, `All Users\\Application Data\\latexdraw`\n\nFor Linux, the installer will create a script in `/usr/bin` to launch LaTeXDraw (if the installer is launched as root).\nOn Windows the installer creates a shortcut.\n\nThe first execution of LaTeXDraw will create the profile of the current user in the following location:\n - for Unix, `~/.latexdraw`\n - for Max OS X, `<user>/Library/Preferences/latexdraw`\n - for Vista, `<user>\\AppData\\Local\\latexdraw`\n - for other Windows, `<user>\\Application Data\\latexdraw`\n\nThis profile contains the preferences of the user and its templates.\n\n\n**HOW TO INSTALL LATEXDRAW MANUALLY**\n\nIf you want to install LaTeXDraw without using the installer you must place `LaTeXDraw.jar`,\n`release_notes.txt`, `licence.txt`, `help/` and `lib/` in the same directory.\nYou can then double-click on `LaTeXDraw.jar` to run the application.\n'
