b'# Dynamic Documents with R and knitr\n\nIn the very beginning, I planned to write this book with Markdown, but later\nI changed my mind and wrote it in LyX instead. For those who are still\ninterested in the Markdown source, please see the [markdown](markdown)\ndirectory.\n\nNow this book has been published by [Chapman &\nHall](https://www.crcpress.com/Dynamic-Documents-with-R-and-knitr-Second-Edition/Xie/9781498716963). You can also find\nit on [Amazon](http://amzn.com/1498716962). There is a\n[book review](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v56/b02/) published in the Journal of\nStatistical Software, which may give you a better idea of this book than my\nown introduction.\n\n## The book source\n\nBesides the old Markdown source which is really only an empty sketch, this\nrepository also provides the real source files for the first three chapters\nof the book, so that you can learn how the book was written and quickly get\nstarted with writing books using the LaTeX style by Chapman & Hall.\n\nThe main file is `DDR-Yihui-Xie-Chap1-3.lyx`; the Rnw file\n`DDR-Yihui-Xie-Chap1-3.Rnw` was exported from LyX; `krantz.cls` is the LaTeX\nclass provided by Chapman & Hall, and I wrote a simple LyX layout file\n`krantz.layout`; `DDR-Yihui-Xie.bib` contains some bibliography entries, and\n`DDR-packages.bib` is dynamically generated from **knitr** (see the last\nchunk in the LyX or Rnw file).\n\nThe PDF of the first three chapters can be downloaded\n[here :arrow_down:](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/releases/download/doc/DDR-Yihui-Xie-Chap1-3.pdf).\n\nFor Linux users, the minimal version of LyX for this book is 2.0.3 (as you can\nget from Debian). For Windows/Mac OS X users, just download the latest binaries\nfrom the [LyX website](http://lyx.org). If you do not use LyX, you can simply\nopen the Rnw file and start from there.\n\nBe sure to read the session info in the preface because your R packages may\nnot be up-to-date to reproduce the PDF. Normally I use development versions\nof my packages, because I often find little problems that I need to solve\nfor the book, and these changes will end up in the development versions.\n\n## Contact\n\nGitHub issues (<https://github.com/yihui/knitr-book/issues>) is the\npreferred way for feedbacks.
