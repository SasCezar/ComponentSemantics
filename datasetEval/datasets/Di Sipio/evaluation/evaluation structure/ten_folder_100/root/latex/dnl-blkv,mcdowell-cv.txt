b'# McDowell CV\nMcDowell CV is a LuaLaTeX class for building neat and space-efficient CVs using the design originally proposed by Gayle L. McDowell at \nhttp://www.careercup.com/resume. \n\nThe class is based on `article` class. The paper format is set to U.S. letterpaper by default. A template showing an example usage of the class is included.\n\n## Screenshot\n<img src="https://github.com/dnl-blkv/mcdowell-cv/blob/master/McDowell_CV.png" width="240px"/>\n\n## Use Cases\n- A great tool making it easy to build CVs: https://latexresu.me/.\n\n## Class Options\n - `calibri` - sets calibri as the main font. Otherwise the default font is Times New Roman since version 1.1.0.\n\n## Commands\nThe class features the following commands:\n - `\\name{name}` - defines the applicant\'s name to be printed by `\\printheader`.\n - `\\address{address}` - defines the applicant\'s address to be printed by `\\printheader`.\n - `\\contacts{contacts}` - defines the applicant\'s contacts to be printed by `\\printheader`.\n - `\\makecvheader` - prints the CV header consisting of the name (see the `\\name` command), address (see the `\\address` command) and contacts (see the `\\contacts` command).\n \n## Environments\n - `\\begin{cvsection}{sectionname}` - prints a section with a header consisting of the name in bold small caps and a page-wide horizontal line below.\n - `\\begin{cvsubsection}[linesnum]{left}{center}{right}{content}` - prints a subsection with header consisting of the `left`, `center` and `right` titles. The optional `linesnum` argument defines the amount of lines in the header. The argument only affects the vertical spacing between the environment header and content thus eliminating the effect of *tabu* package vertical spacing bug.\n\n## Build Instructions\n- Make sure `lualatex` (see http://www.luatex.org/download.html) is installed on your machine and is available in the terminal or a command line client of your choice.\n- In the terminal or a command line client of your choice, go to the folder containing `McDowell_CV_Template.tex` and `mcdowellcv.cls`, and run the following command: `lualatex McDowell_CV_Template.tex`.\n'
