b"# CV Boilerplate\n\n> I consider LaTeX resumes to be a secret handshake of sorts, something that makes me significantly more likely to be inclined to hire a candidate.  \n> &mdash;<cite>[zackelan](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10452606)<cite> on HN\n\nA boilerplate to ease the pain of building and maintaining a CV or r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 using LaTeX.\n\n## Intro\n\nSeparating presentation from content makes life easier. The typical content of a CV is a perfect fit for a YAML file due to its structured nature:\n\n```YAML\n---\nname: Friedrich Nietzsche\naddress:\n- Humboldtstra\xc3\x9fe 36\n- 99425 Weimar\n- Prussia\nemail: friedrich@thevoid.de\n# ...\nexperience:\n- years: 1879--1889\n  employer: Freiberufler\n  job: Freier Philisoph\n  city: Sils-Maria\n- years: 1869\xe2\x80\x93-1879\n  employer: Universit\xc3\xa4t Basel\n  job: Professor f\xc3\xbcr klassische Philologie\n  city: Basel\n```\n\nThat makes super easy to update a CV while keeping a consistent structure.\n\nThanks to [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), we can then access our data from `template.tex` using a special notation. Iterating on repetitive data structures becomes trivial:\n\n```latex\n$for(experience)$\n  $experience.years$\\\\\n  \\textsc{$experience.employer$}\\\\\n  \\emph{$experience.job$}\\\\\n  $experience.city$\\\\[.2cm]\n$endfor$\n```\n\nLaTeX takes then care of the typesetting with its usual elegance. Below a preview of the final result. Check out the [output](output.pdf) to see the compiled PDF.\n\n![preview](preview.png)\n\nWith this method, you can keep your entire CV encoded in a single YAML file, put it under version control (into a gist, for instance), and generate a PDF on the fly when needed. You can also easily export it to other formats, like HTML for web publishing (I've heard [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) likes YAML). Convenient, portable and time-proof.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n1. LaTeX with the following extra packages: `fontspec` `geometry` `multicol` `xunicode` `xltxtra` `marginnote` `sectsty` `ulem` `hyperref` `polyglossia`\n2. [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), the universal document converter.\n\nTo install LaTeX on Mac OS X, I recommend getting the smaller version BasicTeX from [here](https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html) and installing the additional packages with `tlmgr` afterwards. Same goes for Linux: install `texlive-base` with your package manager and add the needed additional packages later.\n\nTo install pandoc on Mac OS X, run `brew install pandoc`. To install it on Linux, refer to the [official docs](http://pandoc.org/installing.html).\n\n## Getting started\n\n1. Fill `details.yml` with your personal details, work experience, education, and desired settings.\n2. Run `make` to compile the PDF.\n3. Tweak on `template.tex` until you're satisfied with the result.\n\n**Note**: this template needs to be compiled with XeTeX.\n\n### Note for Windows users\n\nAlthough I didn't test it, you can probably use this on Windows, too. Both [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) and LaTeX can be installed on Windows (I recommend [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) for that) and you should be able to run makefiles on Windows through [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). If that's too much hassle, this command should do the trick in Powershell:\n\n    pandoc details.yml -o output.pdf --template=template.tex --pdf-engine=xelatex\n\n## Available settings\n\n- **`mainfont`**: Hoefler Text is the default, but every font installed on your system should work out of the box (thanks, XeTeX!)\n- **`fontsize`**: Possible values here are 10pt, 11pt and 12pt.\n- **`lang`**: Sets the main language through the `polyglossia` package. This is important for proper hyphenation, among other things.\n- **`geometry`**: A string that sets the margins through `geometry`. Read [this](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Page_size_and_margins) to learn how this package works.\n\n## Recommended readings\n\n- [Typesetting Automation](http://mrzool.cc/writing/typesetting-automation/), my article about this project with in-depth instructions and some suggestions for an ideal workflow.\n- [Why I do my r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 in LaTeX](http://www.toofishes.net/blog/why-i-do-my-resume-latex/) by Dan McGee\n- [What are the benefits of writing resumes in TeX/LaTeX?](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/11955/what-are-the-benefits-of-writing-resumes-in-tex-latex) on TeX Stack Exchange\n- [Typesetting your academic CV in LaTeX](http://nitens.org/taraborelli/cvtex) by Dario Taraborelli\n- [R\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 advices](http://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html) from Butterick's Practical Typography \n- [Multichannel Text Processing](https://ia.net/topics/multichannel-text-processing/) by iA\n- [Why Microsoft Word must Die](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html) by Charlie Stross\n- [Word Processors: Stupid and Inefficient](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html) by Allin Cottrell\n- [Proprietary Binary Data Formats: Just Say No!](http://www.podval.org/~sds/data.html) by Sam Steingold\n- [Dimitrie Hoekstra](https://medium.com/@dimitrieh/a-curriculum-vitae-latex-typesetting-automation-adventure-with-gitlab-6ac233c0b66b#.v66feylcu) takes automation to the next level thanks to GitLab's continuous integration feats\n\n## Resources\n\n- Refer to [pandoc's documentation](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates) to learn more about how templates work.\n- If you're not familiar with the YAML syntax, [here](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)'s a good overview.\n- If you want to edit the template but LaTeX scares you, these [docs](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Main_Page) put together by ShareLaTeX cover most of the basics and are surprisingly kind to the beginner.\n- Odds are your question already has an answer on [TeX Stack Exchange](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Main_Page).
