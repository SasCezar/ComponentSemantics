It fully supports [`KaTeX`](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) and [`AsciiMath`](http://asciimath.org/). Qilin works on each desktop platform - it is based on `Chromium` and `Node.js`, licensed under the *[MIT license](#license)*. Qilin is extensible via several [plugins and themes](https://github.com/qilin-editor/qilin-manager). Created documents can be exported as **HTML**, **PDF** and **Markdown**.\n\n![Qilin editor](https://i.imgur.com/VOGLGv5.png)\n</div>\n\n>**Note**: Qilin Editor and all related repositories are still in development - it might not be suitable for daily, intensive usage. As the only active maintainer, I ([@Bartozzz](https://github.com/Bartozzz)) am not able to provide regular updates, so any help is more than welcome.\n\n<h2 align="center">Contributing</h2>\n\n### Bug reporting\n\n[![Github Open Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/qilin-editor/qilin-app.svg)](https://github.com/qilin-editor/qilin-app/issues)\n[![Github Closed Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed-raw/qilin-editor/qilin-app.svg)](https://github.com/qilin-editor/qilin-app/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)\n[![Github Pull Requests](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr-raw/qilin-editor/qilin-app.svg)](https://github.com/qilin-editor/qilin-app/pulls)\n\n**We want contributing to Qilin to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for everyone.** Changes and improvements are more than welcome!
