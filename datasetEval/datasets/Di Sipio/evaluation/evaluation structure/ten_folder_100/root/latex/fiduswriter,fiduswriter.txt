b"Fidus Writer\n============\n\nFidus Writer is an online collaborative editor especially made for academics who need to use citations and/or formulas. The editor focuses on the content rather than the layout, so that with the same text, you can later on publish it in multiple ways: On a website, as a printed book, or as an ebook. In each case, you can choose from a number of layouts that are adequate for the medium of choice.\n\n\n[![Fidus Writer](https://snapcraft.io/fiduswriter/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/fiduswriter)\n\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/fiduswriter/fiduswriter/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/fiduswriter/fiduswriter?branch=master)\n\n[![Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/badge/tracker?tracker_id=328497)](https://www.bountysource.com/trackers/328497-fiduswriter?utm_source=328497&utm_medium=shield&utm_campaign=TRACKER_BADGE)\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstallation procedures can be found in our [WIKI](https://github.com/fiduswriter/fiduswriter/wiki/).\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nFor details on contributing, please check http://fiduswriter.org/help-us/ .\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nAll of Fidus Writer's original code is licensed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, for details see LICENSE.
