b'# The LaTeX2e Kernel Code Repository\n\n## Overview\n\nThis repository hosts development of the core LaTeX distribution, which\ncomprises:\n\n- The LaTeX kernel itself (`base`)\n- LaTeX team documentation (`doc`)\n- Packages which must be available (`required`). These are\n  - Essential tools (`tools`)\n  - Core graphics and color support (`graphics`)\n  - Key mathematics support (`amsmath`)\n\nThe master public Git repository is hosted on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e).\n\nNote that Babel moved to its own repository in 2019:\n[GitHub](https://github.com/latex3/babel); any issues related to Babel should\nbe reported there.\n\n## LaTeX Version number\n\nThe LaTeX version is defined in the file `ltvers.dtx` in the two commands\n`\\fmtversion`  (the main version) and `\\patch@level` (the patch level).\nA negative patch level indicates a pretest version.\n\nEach component of the core distribution contains a `README` file which\nis tagged with the appropriate release string prior to upload to CTAN.\n\n## Issues\n\nOnly issues *specifically related to these components* should be logged [with\nthe team on GitHub](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues). The LaTeX\necosystem is large, and there are *many* (thousands) of additional packages not\nmaintained by us: issues related to the use of those need to be reported to the\nrelevant maintainers.\n\nTo help you making the right decision where to report an issue we ask to start\nyour minimal example file showing the problem *always* with\n\n    \\RequirePackage{latexbug}\n\nMore details on creating issue reports for the core LaTeX distribution\nare given in our [CONTRIBUTING guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Support\n\nWe are unable to provide advice/support here: community sites such as\n[TeX-LaTeX StackExchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com) and [The LaTeX\nCommunity](http://latex-community.org) are available for general help. See also\n[the help pages on our website](https://www.latex-project.org/help) for further\nsuggestions.\n\n## Code fixes\n\nChanges to the core LaTeX distribution have to be approached bearing in mind\nthe importance of maintaining stability. This means that all changes have to be\ncarefully weighed up, balancing the issues addressed by a change with\nthe effects on existing documents. We strongly suggest raising suggestions on\nthe [LaTeX-L mailing\nlist](https://listserv.uni-heidelberg.de/cgi-bin/wa?A0=latex-l) early.\n\nYou can subscribe to the LaTeX-L mailing list by sending mail to\n\n    listserv@urz.uni-heidelberg.de\n\nwith the body containing\n\n    subscribe LATEX-L <Your-First-Name> <Your-Second-Name>\n\n## Development team\n\nThe LaTeX kernel is developed by [The LaTeX3 Project](https://latex-project.org).\n\n## Copyright\n\nThis README file is copyright 2019 The LaTeX Project.\n'
