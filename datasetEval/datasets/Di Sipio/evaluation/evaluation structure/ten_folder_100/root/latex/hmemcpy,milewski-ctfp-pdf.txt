After installing Nix, type `nix-shell` in the root directory of the project. This will download all the needed dependencies and tools to build the book (TeXLive, required fonts and packages, Pygments theme for syntax highligting, etc.)\n\nWhen the download is complete, and you\'re prompted with a shell, use the instructions below to build the book.\n\nThe `src` directory contains the LaTeX sources. To recompile the book, go there and enter:\n\n```bash\n$ make\n```\n\nTo build the Scala edition, type:\n\n```bash\n$ make scala\n```\n\nUpon successful compilation, the files will be placed in the `out` directory next to `src`. \n\nThe file `preamble.tex` contains all the configuration and style declarations.\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nPDF LaTeX source and the tools to create it are based on the work by Andres Raba et al., available here: https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf.  \nThe book content is taken, with permission, from Bartosz Milewski\'s blogpost series, and adapted to the LaTeX format.\n\nThanks to the following people for contributing corrections/conversions and misc:\n\n* Oleg Rakitskiy\n* Jared Weakly\n* Paolo G. Giarrusso\n* Adi Shavit\n* Mico Loretan\n* Marcello Seri\n* Erwin Maruli Tua Pakpahan\n* Markus Hauck\n* Yevheniy Zelenskyy\n* Ross Kirsling\n* ...and many others!\n\nNote from Bartosz: I really appreciate all your contributions. You made this book much better than I could have imagined.
