b'# Ti*k*Z\n\n> *TikZ ist kein Zeichnenprogramm*\n\n---\n\nComplete collection of my PGF/TikZ figures. I will do my best to keep it updated as soon as new figures are published.\n\n## Thanks\n\nThis collection could not have been made possible without the help of the following resources:\n\n* [TeXample](http://www.texample.net); the figures from here often provide a solid starting point.\n* [LaTeX Stack Exchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com); threads from here are typically the first results that pop up when googling for a particular technique/problem.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n'
