b'This tool allows you to easily clean the LaTeX code of your paper to submit to\narXiv. From a folder containing all your code, e.g. `/path/to/latex/`, it\ncreates a new folder `/path/to/latex_arXiv/`, that is ready to ZIP and upload to\narXiv.\n\n## Example call:\n\n```\npython -m arxiv-latex-cleaner.arxiv_latex_cleaner /path/to/latex/ --im_size 500 --images_whitelist=\'{"images/im.png":2000}\'\n```\n\n## Main features:\n\n#### Privacy-oriented\n\n*   Removes all auxiliary files (`.aux`, `.log`, `.out`, etc.).\n*   Removes all comments from your code (yes, those are visible on arXiv and you\n    do not want them to be). These also include `\\begin{comment}\\end{comment}`\n    environments.\n*   Optionally removes user-defined commands entered with `commands_to_delete`\n    (such as `\\todo{}` that you at the end redefine as the empty string).\n\n#### Size-oriented\n\nThere is a 10MB limit on arXiv submissions, so to make it fit:\n\n*   Removes all unused `.tex` files (those that are not in the root and not\n    included in any other `.tex` file).\n*   Removes all unused images that take up space (those that are not actually\n    included in any used `.tex` file).\n*   Resizes all images to `im_size` pixels, to reduce the size of the\n    submission. You can whitelist some images to skip the global size using\n    `images_whitelist`.\n*   Optionally compresses `.pdf` files using ghostscript (Linux and Mac only).\n\n## Usage:\n\n```\narxiv_latex_cleaner.py [-h] [--im_size IM_SIZE]\n                       [--images_whitelist IMAGES_WHITELIST]\n                       input_folder\n\npositional arguments:\n  input_folder          Input folder containing the LaTeX code.\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --im_size IM_SIZE     Size of the output images (in pixels, longest side).\n                        Fine tune this to get as close to 10MB as possible.\n  --images_whitelist IMAGES_WHITELIST\n                        Images that won\'t be resized to the default\n                        resolution, but the one provided here in a dictionary\n                        as follows \'{"path/to/im.jpg": 1000}\'\n  --compress_pdf        Compress PDF images using ghostscript (Linux and Mac\n                        only).\n  --commands_to_delete COMMANDS_TO_DELETE [COMMANDS_TO_DELETE ...]\n                        LaTeX commands that will be deleted. Useful for e.g.\n                        user-defined \\todo commands.\n\n```\n\n## Note\n\nThis is not an officially supported Google product.\n'
