KaTeX works inside as a fast math renderer.\n\nYou can install the extension directly from [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath).\n\n### What is new in **mdmath** 2.4.0 ...\n* VScode native clipboard functionality is now used for clipping HTML source to the underlying systems clipboard.\n* Support for [Julia Markdown](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Markdown/) is added.\n* Dependency of third party `node.js` modules is drastically reduced.\n* User defined CSS style is working now.\n* Allow macro definition in a user defined JSON file in addition to macro definition inside of user settings.\n\n## Features\nSimplify the process of authoring and live previewing markdown documents containing math formulas.\nThis extension is a comfortable tool for scientists, engineers and students with markdown as their first choice \ndocument format.\n\n* Inline math\n* Display math\n* Formula numbering\n* Inline math with tables\n* Works offline.\n* Integrated in native markdown viewer. So after installing the extension, TeX math is properly displayed in the markdown preview window.\n* Based on [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) plugin [markdown-it-texmath](https://github.com/goessner/markdown-it-texmath).\n* Using vscode\'s [Markdown Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/api-markdown).\n* Editor view and Preview are synchronized while scrolling.\n* Copy resulting HTML code to the system clipboard.\n* Due to [markdown-it-texmath\'s](https://github.com/goessner/markdown-it-texmath) support of different formula delimiters, these are also available and user configurable with mdmath:\n  * `\'dollars\'` (default)\n    * inline: `$...$`\n    * display: `$$...$$`\n    * display + equation number: `$$...$$ (1)`\n  * `\'brackets\'`\n    * inline: `\\(...\\)`\n    * display: `\\[...\\]`\n    * display + equation number: `\\[...\\] (1)`\n  * `\'gitlab\'`\n    * inline: ``$`...`$``\n    * display: `` ```math ... ``` ``\n    * display + equation number: `` ```math ... ``` (1)``\n  * `\'julia\'`\n    * inline: `$...$`  or ``` ``...`` ```\n    * display: `` ```math ... ``` ``\n    * display + equation number: `` ```math ... ``` (1)``\n  * `\'kramdown\'`\n    * inline: ``$$...$$``\n    * display: `$$...$$`\n    * display + equation number: `$$...$$ (1)`\n\n![mdmath editing](./img/mdmath.gif)\n\n## Installation ...\n\n### ... from inside of VSCode\n\nPress <kbd>F1</kbd> key inside of *Visual Studio Code* and type `extension`. Choose `Extensions: Install Extension` \nand then select the `Markdown+Math` extension from the list.\n\n### ... from Mac & Linux Command Line\n```\ncd $HOME/.vscode/extensions\ngit clone https://github.com/goessner/mdmath.git\ncd mdmath\nnpm install\n```\n\n### ... from Windows Command Line\n```\ncd  %USERPROFILE%\\.vscode\\extensions\ngit clone https://github.com/goessner/mdmath.git\ncd mdmath\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n* Launch *VS Code*, create or open a markdown file (`.md`).\n* Open a preview window.\n* Typeset in your markdown source window and see the preview window live updating.\n* Press <kbd>Ctrl+K ,</kbd> or run the command `Save Markdown+Math to HTML` to save the corresponding HTML source to the file system. \n* Press <kbd>Ctrl+K .</kbd> or run the command `Clip Markdown+Math to HTML` to copy the corresponding HTML source to the underlying systems clipboard.\n\n##  User Settings\n\n###  Default Settings\n```json\n  "mdmath.delimiters": "dollars",\n  "mdmath.macros": {},\n  "mdmath.macroFile": "",\n  "mdmath.savePath": "./${file.name}.html",\n  "mdmath.autosave": false,\n  "mdmath.style": ""\n```\n###  Example Settings\n![mdmath example user settings](./img/usersettings.png)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* [`markdown-it`](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it): The markdown renderer also used in VS Code.\n* [`katex`](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX): This is where credits for fast rendering TeX math in HTML go to.\n\n## FAQ\n* __How to define my own CSS file for HTML export ?__\n  * Define it by the user setting `mdmath.style` as an absolute URL. So for an example you might choose `mdmath.style: "file://c:/mystyle/mystyle.css"` with windows.\n* __How to define and use macros ?__\n  * Define them in user settings. For example ...\n  ```json\n  "mdmath.macros": {\n      "\\\\RR": "\\\\mathbb{R}",\n      "\\\\vek": "{\\\\begin{pmatrix}#1\\\\\\\\#2\\\\end{pmatrix}}"\n  }\n  ```\n  * Use them in your markdown document. For example ...\n  ```\n  Vectors in $\\RR^2$ have a shape of\n\n  $$\\vek{x}{y}$$\n  ```\n* __How to define macros in a user macro file?__\n  * Create a JSON file containing the macros and define its path in user settings. For example ...\n  ```json\n  "mdmath.macroFile": "c:/myfiles/mymacros.json"\n  ```\n  * Define the macros the same way as in the user settings.\n  * User macro definition file has priority over user defined macro settings, which are ignored then.\n* __Are there global predefined macros ?__\n  * No. Macros are user defined with user settings `mdmath.macros`. So they are available in all user specific markdown documents.\n* __Can I write the HTML source to a file ?__\n  * Yes. Use the <kbd>Markdown: Save Markdown+Math to Html</kbd> command or the key binding (`\'ctrl+K ,\'`). \n  * The Html file is written to the folder where the markdown file resides in. This is the default.\n  * You can change the destination folder by specifying a relative path to your working directory with the help of the user setting `mdmath.savePath`. So for an example you might choose `mdmath.savePath: "./html/${file.name}.html"`.\n* __Can I synchronously let the HTML source file update ?__\n  * Yes. Simply set the user setting `mdmath.autosave: true` for this (default is `false`).\n  * Now, whenever you save your markdown file, the corresponding Html file is also saved.\n  * The destination folder `mdmath.savePath` is used for this.\n\n* __Formula highlighting is broken ?__\n  * It is implemented only for `$` delimiters at present.\n  * `$` characters in markdown text are sometimes confused with math delimiters. Enclose them by backticks (`) then.\n  * Formula highlighting is possible only for formulas on a single line. It breaks with every newline character.\n  * Math highlighting is completely different from LaTeX math parsing.\n* __Which functions does KaTeX support ?__\n  * See them listed at [KaTeX Supported Functions](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/docs/supported.html) and [KaTeX Support Table](https://katex.org/docs/support_table.html).\n* __What if I need to use the currency symbol `$` also in my markup ?__\n  * It should be safe to use it. If in doubt escape it.\n* __What are the restrictions with inline formulas ?__\n  * Whitespace after opening `$` and before closing `$` is not allowed.\n  * Numeric character before opening `$` and after closing `$` is not allowed.\n  * At least one character (whitespace ?) is required between two consecutive inline formulas.\n  * Line break inside is not allowed.\n* __What are the restrictions with display formulas ?__\n  * Not allowed inline of text.\n  * Not allowed inside of tables. Use inline math there instead.\n  * Blank lines before and behind required.\n  * Restrictions for inline formulas do not apply.\n* __Can I use math markup in blockquotes ?__\n  * We can use inline and display formulas in blockquote sections. Starting with version 2.3.8 display formulas have to be written on a single line in blockquote sections. This might break only rarely some recent documents.\n* __Can I use math markup in code blocks ?__\n  * No, math markup in code blocks is shown - as expected - as markup. This is consistent now, but in contrast to `mdmath` versions prior to 2.0.\n* __Can I access the HTML source of the markdown file ?__\n  * Yes. Use the <kbd>Markdown: Clip Markdown+Math to Html</kbd> command or the key binding (`\'ctrl+K .\'`). \n  * The markdown preview window has to be opened once for this in order to function properly.\n  * You need to have the markdown source window activated here (not the preview window!). \n  * Please note, that the resulting HTML source references \'CDN\'-located remote css files. Change those references to local URL\'s if necessary.\n* __Is PDF output supported ?__\n  * Not directly. In order to create `*.pdf` output from your Markdown you can create a `*.html` document first and print it then using a `PDF` printer or use [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/).\n  * See [Compiling Markdown into HTML](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown).\n* __Can I use custom CSS styles for the preview window ?__\n  *  Yes. Set `mdmath.style` in user settings to the location of your custom CSS file. Its path must be relative to this extension root.\n* __Cannot copy to clipboard on Linux ?__\n  * This may be because the upstream `clipboardy` needs `xsel` on Linux. Run `sudo apt-get install xsel` to install.\n* __Can we store Latex macros with mdmath ?__\n  * Yes, there is a new section `mdmath.globalMacros` in `package.json`. Try to expand it with your own macros.\n\n## Thank You\n\nThe following folks helped to make `mdmath` even better.\n\n* [elviswolcott](https://github.com/elviswolcott): Implemented the feature of directly saving HTML to the file system including `autosave` ability.\n* [colinfang](https://github.com/colinfang): helped with implementing macros for mdmath 2.3.5.\n* [lincr](https://github.com/LCAR979): Helped with fixing problems with `mdmath.clipToHtml` under Ubuntu.\n* [TonySFU](https://github.com/TonySFU): Helped with fixing encoding problems with Chinese language under macOS when using `mdmath.clipToHtml`.\n* [floatdrop](https://github.com/floatdrop): Verifying that [clipboardy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/clipboardy) is a better alternative to `copy-paste` by implementing.\n* [zhanglix](https://github.com/zhanglix): Helped with fixing the `newline` bug with `gitlab` delimiters.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [`changelog.md`](changelog.md)\n\n## License\n\n*Markdown+Math* for VS Code is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n \xc2\xa9 [Stefan G\xc3\xb6ssner](https://github.com/goessner)\n'
