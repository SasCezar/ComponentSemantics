b'LaTeX-examples\n==============\n\nMore than 570 examples for the usage of LaTeX. You can check that with the\nfollowing command:\n\n```bash\n$ find . -type d | sort | awk \'$0 !~ last "/" {print last} {last=$0} END {print last}\' | grep -v .git | wc -l\n```\n\n\nMany examples can be found on [my Wikpedia Commons user page](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:MartinThoma#Galerie).\n\nYou might also be interested in [my Blog](http://martin-thoma.com/tag/tikz/).\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nEvery LaTeX file is in a seperate folder and has its own Makefile.\nSo you can simply generate the PDF by typing `make` in the terminal.\n\nIf you want to get all examples offline, you have to execute\n\n```bash\n$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/MartinThoma/LaTeX-examples.git\n```\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n* You should have the latest LaTeX version. Here are\n  [LaTeX installation instructions](http://martin-thoma.com/how-to-install-the-latest-latex-version/).\n* If you want to use the Makefiles, you have to have make installed.\n\n\nContact\n=======\nIf you have examples or suggestions for improving given examples, please send\nthem to info@martin-thoma.de.\n\n\nRe-use\n=======\nFeel free to use and modify the examples in this repository,\nbut please add a link to this repository or martin-thoma.com.\n\n*Most* of the content was created completely by me.
