b'# Better BibTeX for Zotero\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex)\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex](https://badges.gitter.im/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex.svg)](https://gitter.im/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)\n\nBetter BibTeX (BBT) is an extension for [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) and [Juris-M](https://juris-m.github.io) that makes it easier to manage bibliographic data, especially for people authoring documents using text-based toolchains (e.g. based on [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) / [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org)).\n\n## Features\n\n### Facilities for generating citation keys\n* Stable [citation keys](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/), without key clashes! Generates citation keys that take into account other existing keys in your library\n  that are not part of the items you export. Prevent random breakage!\n* Set your own, fixated [citation keys](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/), generate citation keys from [JabRef patterns](https://help.jabref.org/en/BibtexKeyPatterns), drag and drop LaTeX citations, add other custom BibLaTeX fields.\n\n### Conversion between formats and encodings\n* Zotero does all its work in UTF-8 Unicode, which is absolutely the right thing to do. Unfortunately, for those shackled\nto BibTeX and who cannot (yet) move to BibLaTeX, unicode is a major PITA. Also, Zotero supports some simple HTML markup\nin your references that Bib(La)TeX won\'t understand.\n\n* BBT will convert from/to HTML/LaTeX:\n\n  - `<i>...</i>`&#8660;`\\emph{...}`/`\\textit{...}`\n  - `<b>...</b>`&#8660;`\\textbf{...}`\n  - `<sup>...</sup>`&#8660;`\\_{...}` and `<sub>...</sub>`&#8660;`^{...}`. \n  \n  More can be added on request.\n  \n  BBT contains a comprehensive list of LaTeX constructs, so stuff like `\\"{o}` or `\\"o` will be converted to their unicode equivalents on import (e.g., `\\"{o}` to `\xc3\xb6`), and their unicode equivalents back to `\\"{o}` if you have that option enabled (but you don\'t have to if you use BibLaTeX, which has fairly good Unicode support).\n  \n  If you need literal LaTeX in your export: surround it with `<script>`...`</script>` (or `<pre>`...`</pre>`, which do the same) markers.\n  \n### Facilities for exporting data from Zotero\n* Highly [customized exports](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/).\n* Fixes date field exports: export dates like \'forthcoming\' as \'forthcoming\' instead of empty, but normalize valid dates\n  to unambiguous international format.\n* [Auto export](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/auto/) of collections or entire libraries when they change.\n* [Pull export](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/pull/) from the embedded webserver.\n* Automatic [journal abbreviation](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/).\n\n## Getting started\nTo get started, read the [installation instructions](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/).\n\n## How does it work ?\nAt its core, BBT behaves like any Zotero import/export module; anywhere you can export or import bibliography items in Zotero,\nyou\'ll find *Better X* listed among the choices.  \n\nIf nothing else, you could keep your existing workflow as-is, and just enjoy the improved LaTeX &harr; unicode translation on import and export and more accurate field mapping.\n\nBetter BibTeX works from [BibTeXing](http://ctan.cs.uu.nl/biblio/bibtex/base/btxdoc.pdf) and [Tame the\nBeaST](http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~markey/BibTeX/doc/ttb_en.pdf) for BibTeX, and\n[The Biblatex Package](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf) for BibLaTeX, but\nsince there isn\'t really a definitive manual for either format that is universally followed by Bib(La)TeX\neditors/processors, I\'m pragmatic about implementing what works.\n\n## Got problems? We got fixes!\n\nIf you have any questions on BBT\'s use, do not hesitate to [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues/new) and ask for help. \n\nIf you\'re reporting a bug in BBT, please take a moment to glance through the [support request guidelines](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/support/); it will make sure I get your problem fixed as quick as possible.\nClear bug reports commonly have really short time-to-fix, so if you report something, stick around -- it may be done as you wait.\n\nThe support request guidelines are very detailed, perhaps to the point of being off-putting, but please do not fret; these guidelines simply express my ideal bug submission.\nI of course prefer very clearly documented issue reports over fuzzy ones, but I prefer fuzzy ones over missed ones.\n\n## Sponsoring BBT\n\nWhile the development needs of BBT are to a large extent covered\nby the generosity towards open-source developers of services such\nas github and travis, my development system does require the\noccasional upgrade; also, I enjoy getting the occasional frivolous\ntech-toy that I wouldn\'t otherwise grant myself. While you should\nfeel in no way obligated to pay for BBT, [anything you can spare](https://www.paypal.me/retorquere) is very much appreciated.\nIf you\'d rather contribute a little bit each month (and a little\nmeans a lot) so I can save up for a replacement a year or so down\nthe line, head on over to [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/retorquere),\nbut mind that Patreon takes a fairly large cut of what you give.\n\nMany, many thanks, also to the existing contributors -- thanks to you I\'ve hit my first target and have been able to replace my trusty macbook air with a newer macbook pro which has much more breathing room.\n'
