b"# Beamer - A LaTeX class for producing presentations\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `beamer` class is focussed on producing (on-screen) presentations, along\nwith support material such as handouts and speaker notes. Content is created\nin a `frame` environment, each of which can be divided up into a number of\nslides (actual output pages). A simple 'action' notation is used to specify\nwhich material appears on each slide within a frame. The class supports a\nrange of environments to enable complex slide relationships to be constructed.\n\nThe appearance of slides is controlled by a template system. Many of the\nelements of slides can be adjusted by setting simple key-based values in\nthe preamble. More complex changes can be implemented by altering specific,\ntargeted definitions without needing to re-write entire blocks of code. This\nallows a variety of visual appearances to be selected for the same content\nsource.\n\n## License\n\nThe `beamer` class is made available under the LaTeX Project Public License\n(LPPL) and the GNU Public License (GPL).
