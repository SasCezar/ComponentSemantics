b'# JupyterLab LaTeX\n\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-latex/master?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fsample.tex)\n\nAn extension for JupyterLab which allows for live-editing of LaTeX documents.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use, right-click on an open `.tex` document within JupyterLab, and select `Show LaTeX Preview`:\n![preview](images/show_preview.png)\nThis will compile the `.tex` file and open the rendered PDF document.\nSubsequent saves of the file will automatically update the PDF.\nIf the PDF fails to compile (possibly due to a syntax error),\nan error panel will open detailing the LaTeX error.\n\nFor more advanced usage documentation, see [here](docs/advanced.md).\n\n## Requirements\n\n- JupyterLab 1.0\n- Python >= 3.6\n- An application that can compile `.tex` files to PDF (e.g., `pdflatex`, `xelatex`; use `pdflatex.exe` on Windows with MiKTeX). This application must be available as a command in the same environment as the notebook server.\n- An application that can process `.bib` files for producing bibliographies. As with the LaTeX command, this must be available in the same environment as the notebook server.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis extension includes both a notebook server extension (which interfaces with the LaTeX compiler)\nand a lab extension (which provides the UI for the LaTeX preview).\nIn order to use it, you must enable both of them.\n\nTo install the server extension, run the following in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npip install jupyterlab_latex\n```\n\nIf you are running Notebook 5.2 or earlier, enable the server extension by running\n\n```bash\njupyter serverextension enable --sys-prefix jupyterlab_latex\n```\n\nTo install the lab extension, run\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/latex\n```\n\n## Customization\n\nThe extension defaults to running `xelatex` on the server.\nThis command may be customized (e.g., to use `pdflatex` instead) by customizing\nyour `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file:\n\n```python\nc.LatexConfig.latex_command = \'pdflatex\'\n```\n\nThe extension defaults to running `bibtex` for generating a bibliography\nif a `.bib` file is found. You can also configure the bibliography command\nby setting\n\n```python\nc.LatexConfig.bib_command = \'<custom_bib_command>\'\n```\n\n### Security and customizing shell escapes\n\nLaTeX files have the ability to run arbitrary code by triggering external\nshell commands. This is a security risk, and so most LaTeX distributions\nrestrict the commands that you can run in the shell.\n\nYou can customize the behavior by setting the `LatexConfig.shell_escape` value.\nIt can take three values: `"restricted"` (default) to allow only commands\nconsidered safe to be executed, `"allow"` to allow all commands, and `"disallow"`\nto disallow all commands.\nFor example, to force your LaTeX distribution to run any command, use:\n\n```python\nc.LatexConfig.shell_escape = "allow"\n```\n\n## Changes\n\nFor information on the changes with different versions of the `jupyterlab-latex` library, see our [changelog](./docs/changelog.md)\n'
