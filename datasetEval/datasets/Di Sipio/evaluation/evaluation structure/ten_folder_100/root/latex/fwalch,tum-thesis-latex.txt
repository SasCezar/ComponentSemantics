b'# LaTeX template for TUM theses\n\nThis is a LaTeX template created according to the guidelines for TUM informatics theses in SS 2013. **Always check the [current formatting guidelines][thesis-guidelines] before you hand in.** See [`build/main.pdf`][sample-pdf] for an example PDF created with this template.\n\nNote: Because of copyright considerations, TUM logos are not included in this template. Unfortunately, the logos are also not available on the MyTUM website anymore.\n\nComments & contributions welcome!\n\n## Quickstart\n\n * [Download][template-download] and extract the template, or upload it to an online editor such as [Overleaf][overleaf] or [ShareLaTeX][sharelatex]. If you prefer to use Git, just clone/fork the repository.\n * If your editor provides support for compiling LaTeX, set it up to use `pdflatex` and `biber`. Set the master document to `main.tex`. Alternatively, you can use the provided Makefile to generate a PDF in the `build` directory (requires `latexmk`).\n * Look for `TODO` comments in the provided files. Start at `main.tex`.\n\nIf you are new to LaTeX, the [ShareLaTeX knowledge base][sharelatex-kb] or the [LaTeX Wikibook][latex-wikibook] might help.\n\nFor additional hints, have a look at [the wiki][wiki]. If you still have problems with the template, feel free to [create an issue][issue]. For general LaTeX questions, use [TeX StackExchange][tex-se].\n\n## License\n\n[![Creative Commons License][license-image]][license]\n\nThis template is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License][license], meaning that:\n\n * You can share (copy, redistribute) and adapt (remix, transform, build upon) this template for any purpose, even commercially.\n * If you share the template or a modified (derived) version of it, you must attribute the template to the original authors ([Florian Walch and contributors][template-authors]) by providing a [link to the original template][template-url] and indicate if changes were made.\n * Any derived template has to use the [same][license] or a [compatible license][license-compatible].\n\nThe license **applies only to the template**; there are no restrictions on the resulting PDF file or the contents of your thesis.\n\n[issue]: https://github.com/fwalch/tum-thesis-latex/issues\n[latex-wikibook]: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX\n[license-compatible]: https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses\n[license-image]: https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png\n[license]: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\n[overleaf]: https://www.overleaf.com/\n[sample-pdf]: https://raw.github.com/fwalch/tum-thesis-latex/master/build/main.pdf\n[sharelatex-kb]: https://www.sharelatex.com/learn\n[sharelatex]: https://www.sharelatex.com/\n[template-authors]: https://github.com/fwalch/tum-thesis-latex/graphs/contributors\n[template-download]: https://github.com/fwalch/tum-thesis-latex/archive/master.zip\n[template-url]: https://github.com/fwalch/tum-thesis-latex\n[tex-se]: https://tex.stackexchange.com/\n[thesis-guidelines]: http://www.in.tum.de/en/current-students/administrative-matters/thesis-guidelines-and-topics.html\n[wiki]: https://github.com/fwalch/tum-thesis-latex/wiki/\n'
