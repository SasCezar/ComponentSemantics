b"# The LaTeX3 Development Repository\n\n## Overview\n\nThe repository contains development material for LaTeX3. This includes\nnot only code to be developed into the LaTeX3 kernel, but also a variety\nof test, documentation and more experimental material. A great deal of\nthe experimental LaTeX3 code can be loaded within LaTeX2e to allow\ndevelopment and testing to occur.\n\nThe following directories contain experimental LaTeX3 code:\n\n* `l3kernel`: code which is intended to eventually appear in a\n  stand-alone LaTeX3 format. Most of this material is also\n  usable on top of LaTeX2e when loading the `expl3` package.\n* `l3backend`: code for backend (driver) level interaces across\n  the `expl3` codebase.\n* `l3packages`: code which is written to be used on top of\n  LaTeX2e to experiment with LaTeX3 concepts. The interfaces to these\n  higher-level packages are 'stable'.\n* `l3experimental`: code which is written to be used on top of\n  LaTeX2e to experiment with LaTeX3 concepts. The interfaces\n  for these packages are still under active discussion. Parts of this code may\n  eventually be migrated to `l3kernel`, while other parts are tied closely\n  to LaTeX2e and are intended to support mixing LaTeX2e and LaTeX3 concepts.\n* `l3trial`: material which is under very active development, for potential\n  addition to `l3kernel` or `l3experimental`. Material in this directory\n  may include potential replacements for existing modules, where large-scale\n  changes are under-way.\n* `l3leftovers`: code which has been developed in the past by The\n  LaTeX3 Project but is not suitable for use in its current form.\n  Parts of this code may be used as the basis for new developments\n  in `l3kernel` or `l3experimental` over time.\n\nSupport material for development is found in:\n\n* `support`, which contains files for the automated test suite which are\n  'local' to the LaTeX3 repository.\n\nDocumentation is found in:\n\n* `articles`: discussion of LaTeX3 concepts by team members for\n  publication in [_TUGBoat_](http://www.tug.org/tugboat) or elsewhere.\n\nThe repository also contains the directory `xpackages`. This\ncontain code which is being moved (broadly) `l3experimental`.\nOver time, `xpackages` is expected to be removed from the repository.\nThe directory `contrib` is used to test the interaction of LaTeX3\ncode with selected contributed packages.\n\n## Discussion\n\nDiscussion concerning the approach, suggestions for improvements,\nchanges, additions, _etc._ should be addressed to the list\n[LaTeX-L](https://listserv.uni-heidelberg.de/cgi-bin/wa?A0=LATEX-L).\n\nYou can subscribe to this list by sending mail to\n\n    listserv@urz.uni-heidelberg.de\n\nwith the body containing\n\n    subscribe LATEX-L  <Your-First-Name> <Your-Second-Name>\n\n## Issues\n\nThe issue tracker for LaTeX3 is currently located\n[on GitHub](https://github.com/latex3/latex3/issues).\n\nPlease report specific issues with LaTeX3 code there; more general\ndiscussion should be directed to the [LaTeX-L list](#Discussion).\n\n## Build status\n\nLaTeX3 uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) as a hosted continuous\nintegration service. For each commit, the build status is tested using\nthe current release of TeX Live.\n\n_Current build status:_\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/latex3/latex3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/latex3/latex3)\n\n## Development team\n\nLaTeX3 is developed by [The LaTeX3 Project](https://latex-project.org).\n\n## Copyright\n\nThis README file is copyright 2019 The LaTeX3 Project.\n"
