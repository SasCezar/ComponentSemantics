b'# Invoice Ninja\n\nCompanion app for the [Invoice Ninja](https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja) web app.\n\n- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invoiceninja.flutter)\n- [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/invoice-ninja/id1435514417?ls=1&mt=8)\n\nNote: the mobile app requires the latest version of the web app.\n\n<p align="center">\n    <img src="https://github.com/invoiceninja/flutter-mobile/blob/master/samples/screenshots/screenshot_01.png" alt="View Invoice" width="200"/>\n    <img src="https://github.com/invoiceninja/flutter-mobile/blob/master/samples/screenshots/screenshot_02.png" alt="List Invoices" width="200"/>\n    <img src="https://github.com/invoiceninja/flutter-mobile/blob/master/samples/screenshots/screenshot_03.png" alt="Contact Details" width="200"/>\n    <img src="https://github.com/invoiceninja/flutter-mobile/blob/master/samples/screenshots/screenshot_04.png" alt="Edit Product" width="200"/>\n</p>\n\n## Features\n\n- [x] Dashboard\n- [x] Clients\n- [x] Products\n- [x] Invoices\n- [x] Quotes\n- [x] Payments\n- [x] Projects\n- [x] Tasks\n- [x] Vendors\n- [x] Expenses\n- [x] Tablet support\n- [ ] Web/Version 2\n\n## Setting up the app\n- Run `cp lib/.env.dart.example lib/.env.dart` to create the config file.\n- Run `cp android/app/build.gradle.dev android/app/build.gradle` to support running the code unsigned.\n- Run `flutter run` while you have a device connected to the computer or an emulator running and now you can run it.\n\n## Application Architecture\n\nThe application was created using the [Flutter Redux Starter](https://github.com/hillelcoren/flutter-redux-starter).\n\nThe architecture is based off these two projects:\n\n- [Redux Sample](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples/tree/master/example/redux) - [Brian Egan](https://twitter.com/brianegan)\n- [inKino](https://github.com/roughike/inKino) - [Iiro Krankka](https://twitter.com/koorankka)\n\n### Blog Posts\n- [Intro to Google Flutter](https://hillelcoren.com/2018/05/18/flutter-is-darts-killer-app/)\n- [Using Redux to manage state](https://hillelcoren.com/2018/06/01/building-a-large-flutter-app-with-redux/)\n- [Handling complex forms](https://hillelcoren.com/2018/06/18/flutter-using-redux-to-manage-complex-forms-with-multiple-tabs-and-relationships/)\n- [Architectural review](https://hillelcoren.com/2018/08/10/an-architectural-review-of-the-invoice-ninja-flutter-app/)\n- [Additional thoughts](https://hillelcoren.com/2018/08/24/ongoing-adventures-with-flutter-and-redux/)\n\n## Code generation\n- Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` to regenerate the model files. It will also remove the old generated files so conflicts are avoided..\n\n## Tests\n- Run `flutter drive --target=test_driver/all_it.dart` to run the tests\n    \n## Code Signing\n- Run `cp android/app/build.gradle.prod android/app/build.gradle` to support running the code signed\n- Run `cp android/key.properties.example android/key.properties` to create the keys file\n- Run `keytool -genkey -v -keystore key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias invoiceninja` to generate a key to be able to sign the android application.\n- Update `android/key.properties` according to the parameters you entered in previous command when you generated the key \n- Open a new Firebase project from your console. Firebase is used for authentication.\n    - Inside the project go to Authentication and enable at least one method.\n    - After go to add a new Android application. For the package name add `com.invoiceninja.flutter`\n    - Press "Register App" button.\n    - Download "google-services.json" and put it in `android/app` directory.\n\n## Credits\n* [Hillel Coren](https://hillel.dev)\n* [David Bomba](https://github.com/turbo124)\n* [All contributors](https://github.com/invoiceninja/flutter-mobile/graphs/contributors)\n\n**Special thanks to:**\n* [Efthymios Sarmpanis](https://github.com/esarbanis)\n* [Gianfranco Gasbarri](https://github.com/gincos)\n\n## Contributions\n\nWe gladly accept contributions!
