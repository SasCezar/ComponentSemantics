b'== Android Cookbook Examples\n\nThis repo is among the largest collections of Android code samples anywhere; it contains\naround a hundred and fifty compilable source code examples from \nhttp://androidcookbook.com/[the O\'Reilly Android Cookbook], a great source \nof tutorial material for the Android Developer. Not all recipes in the book or online have code\naccompanying them; this repo features code that was either linked by the\ncontributor, or in some cases, re-constructed as a New Project by the\neditor for your convenience.\n\nFurther note that not all programs used in the book/online appear here; some\nof the examples in the book/online are only program fragments taken from\nother programs that can\'t be included. And of course some code is drawn from existing projects\nthat are hosted elsewhere.\n\nEach Directory comprises its own project, and has a name that is cited at the end of the corresponding Recipe, under the "Source Code Download" section. \n\n*NOTE* There are two styles of projects:\n\n. Eclipse projects with the newer Eclipse Andmore;\n. Android Studio projects (most of them complete with their extraneous "app" subdirectory).\n\nThe started-in-Eclipse projects also have configuration files to allow them to be opened in Android Studio.\n\nDuring the runup to the second edition of the book, AndMore appeared to be a viable project\nto maintain Android Eclipse development.\nHowever, over time, it has become clear that AndMore has not attracted enough developer talent\nto remain viable.\nAccordingly, the newest projects here are Android-Studio-Only.\n\nThe table <<table>> shows which projects are set up for which build tools.\n\n*Note that, since Gradle and the Gradle Android Plugin need to be updated \njust about every time your run Android Studio, there is no attempt made\nto keep things up-to-date here; just let Studio do its upgrade thing for you\nand all will be well. They promise.\n\n=== TL;DR: Build Many Projects with Apache Maven\n\nPrerequisites: Java 8+ SDK, Android SDK **including "Google Maven Repository" for compat stuff**, $$git$$, _Maven_\n\n. git clone https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer\n. cd maven-android-sdk-deployer\n. mvn install -P 6.0 # at least\n. mvn install -P 7.0 # also needed\n. cd ..\n. git clone https://github.com/IanDarwin/Android-Cookbook-Examples\n. cd Android-Cookbook-Examples\n. $$mvn -fae package android:install android:run$$\nInclude $$android:install$$ and $$android:run$$ only if you actually want to run them all, and have a device or emulator with some good free space; else just do \'package\')\n. Fix up any that didn\'t work, and send pull requests!\n\n=== Eclipse Issue\n\nIf you get Eclipse-Maven projects failing with this message:\norg.codehaus.plexus.archiver.jar.Manifest.write(java.io.PrintWriter)\n\nthen you need to update your "M2E Connector for Android" to at least 0.17.2.20060614\n\n=== Maven Build: More Details\n\nAbout two thirds of these projects were initially developed using Eclipse ADT, \nand migrated to Maven for automatic building.\nObviously Google has spoken and we will eventually have to migrate kicking and screaming to Android Studio and Gradle, but for now, we are keeping those projects in "bilingual" or "either-IDE mode".\n\nIf you import the entire repo in Eclipse with eGit, be sure to check the `Import all projects`\ncheckbox. If you want to keep these mini-projects separate from your "regular" work, you may want to use the Git repo as an Eclipse workspace (use File->Switch Workspace->Other->Browse). \nThis directory is already set up to be an Eclipse workspace if you want it to\n(the __.metadata__ directory exists and is already in __.gitignore__).\n\n*Note*: As part of the move to Gradle, Google stopped pushing Android releases to Maven Central; their last version\nwas 4.1.1.4, thus Lollipop, Marshmallow, and "N" have been left high-and-dry. \nAnd worse, their SDK license prohibits re-distribution of binaries, so nobody else can step in\nand upload these files to Maven Central. But of course there is a solution.\nTo compile these projects with Maven you will need to download the amazing maven-android-sdk-deployer, which repackages\nfiles from the SDK - after you download it using the Android tools, thus nobody is redistributing it - \ninto your _local_ ++.m2/repository++ so that Maven can find it.\nThis is the function of the first few steps in the numbered list above.\n\nNote that projects using official releases use e.g. com.google.android:android:4.1.1.4 whereas projects deployed\nusing the sdk-deployer use e.g android:android:6.0_r3.\n\nYou can download AndroidCookbookExamples as a Zip file from GitHub, but then you won\'t get updates, and it will be hard to collaborate with the other contributors. If you\'re not familiar with Git and Github, see \nhttps://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/[the getting started page on GitHub] and read up on how to collaborate. You can either send diff/patch files or send a pull request.  Remember that GitHub is a free service for public projects!\n\nMany of the projects may (depending on your version of Eclipse) give you some noise when you first open them due to bin and/or gen being missing. The Eclipse plug-in will usually create them but not notify that it\'s done so, meaning you just have to do Refresh (F5), failing that, close and re-open the project. Does not happen with current Eclipse, last I tried.\n\nThere is neither a Wiki or a Tracker for this Github repository.\nIf a project won\'t open, or won\'t build, we\'d prefer that you fix it and sent a pull request.\nBugs and suggestions about code samples can be made on the Android Cookbook web site (http://androidcookbook.com/). Bugs or suggesions on the published edition of the book should go to http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038092.do; you can also purchase the book there (which helps fund my continued work on this code base).\n\n=== Notes for the First Edition of the book\n\nThe current version of this repo has been reorganized in preparation for the second edition of the book.\nThere have been quite a few projects added since the first published edition of the book, and\na few renamed, so if you have the printed edition from 2012 you \nshould rummage around here before re-typing anything that looks like a full example.\n\nIf you want this repo to correspond to the last minor revision of the first edition,\nuse git to checkout the tag `Book-1.0`.\n\n=== DELETED PROJECTS\n\nJpsTrack and the ToDo applications have graduated to their own github projects, up one level from here on Github.\n\n[[table]]\n=== List of Projects\n\nThe following list is generated (periodically) from the project folders.\nIn the _Builds With_ column, *E* for Eclipse, *M* for Maven, *S* for Android Studio, *G* for Gradle.\nThe Author names have recently been added; if I have missed or mis-attributed any, please\nlet me know and I will happily correct them. You (and I) know who you are.\n\n.List of projects with description and build tools\n[options="header", cols="3,1,1,3,3"]\n|===========\n| Project | Author | Builds With | Function | Notes \n// INSERT TABLE AFTER HERE -
