It focuses on aligning closely with web platform specifications, using convention over configuration, and having minimal framework intrusion. Basically, we want you to just write your code without the framework getting in your way. :wink:\n\nThis library is part of the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) platform. It contains the `aurelia-framework` library, which brings together all the required core aurelia libraries into a ready-to-go application-building platform.\n\nAurelia applications are built by composing a series of simple components. By convention, components are made up of a vanilla JavaScript or Typescript class, with a corresponding HTML template. \n\n```js\n//app.js\nexport class App {\n  welcome = "Welcome to Aurelia";\n\n  quests = [\n    "To seek the holy grail",\n    "To take the ring to Mordor",\n    "To rescue princess Leia"\n  ];\n}\n```\n\n```html\n<!-- app.html -->\n<template>\n  <form>\n    <label for="name-field">What is your name?</label>\n    <input id="name-field" value.bind="name & debounce:500">\n\n    <label for="quest-field">What is your quest?</label>\n    <select id="quest-field" value.bind="quest">\n      <option></option>\n      <option repeat.for="q of quests">${q}</option>\n    </select>\n  </form>\n\n  <p if.bind="name">${welcome}, ${name}!</p>\n  <p if.bind="quest">Now set forth ${quest.toLowerCase()}!</p>\n</template>\n```\n\n> Check out the interactive version of this example on [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/y41qjr36j).\n\nThis example shows you some of the powerful features of the aurelia binding syntax. To see further examples, online playgrounds, guides, and detailed API documentation, head on over to [aurelia.io](https://aurelia.io).\n\nFeeling excited? To quickly get started building your project with aurelia, you can use the [aurelia CLI](https://aurelia.io/docs/cli/basics).\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can read the documentation for the aurelia framework [here](http://aurelia.io/docs).
