b'# Mapbox Android Demo app\n\n![](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo/blob/master/screenshots/splash.png)\n\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo)\n\nThis is a public demo of the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android. The demo app is [available now in the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapbox.mapboxandroiddemo) and it shows off many of the examples found on:\n\n- [https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/examples](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/examples/)\n- [https://docs.mapbox.com/android/java/examples](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/java/examples/)\n- [https://docs.mapbox.com/android/plugins/examples](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/plugins/examples/)\n\n\nThere are also examples that only live in the app. The app\'s "labs" section has examples which often combine various Mapbox tools to create more complex examples.\n\nVisit [the overview page](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/overview/) to get started using the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android in your Android project.\n\n### Steps to adding a new example\nFeedback and contribution are encouraged in this repo. If you\'d like to see a new example added into the app, either [open an issue](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo/issues) or create it yourself and open a pull request following these steps:\n\n* Create a new java file and place in the acceptable folder (`examples` or `labs`) giving it a descriptive name and ending the title with `*Activity`. It\'s important that all activities extend `AppCompat`.\n* If the activity needs a layout, add one with the naming convention `activity_*`.\n* Add the activity to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.\n* Open the `MainActivity.java` file and scroll down to the `listItems` method. You\'ll notice a switch statement, pick one of the cases (categories) and add the new example so it matches the others. \n* Code your example and test to make sure it works properly.\n* Open a pull request with the new example.\n\n**Note:** This repo uses checkstyle to make sure code contributed follows the Mapbox Style standards. When a pull request is opened, Bitrise will check that no style issues occur in the code. Read this [wiki entry](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo/wiki/Setting-up-Mapbox-checkstyle) to set up checkstyle in Android Studio.\n\n\n### Running locally\n\n##### Setting the Mapbox access token\n\n_This demo app uses Mapbox vector tiles, which require a Mapbox account and a Mapbox access token. Obtain a free access token on the [Mapbox account page](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/)._\n\nWith the first Gradle invocation, Gradle will take the value of the `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable and save it to `SharedCode/src/main/res/values/developer-config.xml`. If the environment variable wasn\'t set, you can create/edit the `developer-config.xml` file. Create an `access_token` String resource and paste your access token into it:\n\n```xml\n<string name="access_token">PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE</string>\n```\n##### Product flavors\n\nThe app has a two product flavors; `global` and `china`. The `global` flavor has the full list of standard examples, whereas the `china` flavor has China-specific examples, which use [the Mapbox China Plugin for Android](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/plugins/overview/china/). The plugin requires a special China Mapbox access token. [Contact our sales team to start the process of receiving this special access token](https://www.mapbox.com/contact/sales/).\n\nYou might see China-related examples when you locally run the app on your device. This is because Android Studio is set on the `china` flavor. Find and click on the "Build Variants" tab in the lower left hand corner of the Android Studio window. Then choose `globalDebug` to change the flavor to the `global` flavor. Re-run the app on your device to see the "regular" demo app examples.\n\n<img width="561" alt="screen shot 2019-03-06 at 9 09 13 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4394910/53899659-8bff2a80-3fef-11e9-8466-9a7044f80b64.png">\n\nIf you\'re still having issues, [please open an issue ticket in this repo](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo/issues/new).\n\n\n### Inside the app\n\n<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4394910/42973575-7ade2f44-8b68-11e8-9fa4-341c35171b92.gif" width="325"/> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4394910/42974229-3d6061f2-8b6b-11e8-8c27-be58a0a334cf.gif" width="325"/> \n\n<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4394910/42974704-32f243aa-8b6d-11e8-8f8d-3b47a889f440.gif" width="325"/> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4394910/42974764-832ac1d0-8b6d-11e8-9ca8-cb259471690b.gif" width="325"/> \n'
