b'# AppDevKit\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yahoo/AppDevKit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yahoo/AppDevKit) \n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/yahoo/AppDevKit/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/yahoo/AppDevKit)\n[![CocoaPods](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/AppDevKit.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=flat-square)](https://cocoapods.org/?q=appdevkit)\n\nAppDevKit is an iOS development library that provides developers with useful features to fulfill their everyday iOS app development needs.\n\nYahoo\xe2\x80\x99s Taiwan based iOS app development team has been using this development kit for the past three years, and we plan future apps to use AppDevKit as well. Our use of this code in many apps helped improve its stability and utility. We find these libraries help address some incompatibility issues found in different iOS versions, and overall make app development easier and our apps operate more consistently. \n\nAppDevKit has five major parts that include command, user interfaces, animations, image view, and list view support libraries. AppDevKit could be installed by CocoaPods. Please feel welcome to use AppDevKit in your iOS projects as it is licensed under the permissive open source BSD license. \n\nYou can help contribute improvements to this project too. If you have suggestions, corrections, or enhancements, please send us a pull request. If you have questions for the team, you can contact **cfsung@oath.com** directly, or the core team at **app-dev-kit@oath.com**. Thank you for checking this out. \n\n<img src="img/AppDevKit-Sticker.png">\n\n## Usage\n\n### Installation with CocoaPods\n\nThe easiest way to leverage AppDevKit is using CocoaPods. Please edit your **Podfile** like this:\n\n<pre>\nsource \'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git\'  \n\npod \'AppDevKit\'\n</pre>\n\nAppDevKit has 5 sub-pods. They\'re **AppDevCommonKit**, **AppDevUIKit**, **AppDevAnimateKit**, **AppDevImageKit** and **AppDevListViewKit**. If you don\'t want to install whole package, you could pick sub-library and use CocoaPods to install it. For example:\n\n<pre>\nsource \'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git\'  \n\n# Only insatll image kit in AppDevKit\npod \'AppDevKit/AppDevImageKit\'\n</pre>\n\n\n\n### Basic Usage\n  \n  Using this develop kit is very simple. First at all, import it in your any code file or just put it in prefix file (`.pch`). Then you will enjoy this develop kit. \n  \n    #import <AppDevKit.h>\n\n### Common Tools\n\n  - **ADKAppUtil** > The foundational tools to support common tasks.\n  - **ADKStringHelper** > The string formatter that will generate formatted strings form date, number and etc for you.\n  - **ADKCalculatorHelper** > The calculation set including distance, size, width, height, etc.\n  - **ADKNibCacheManager** > The manager to cache different instances in memory and keep it as a singleton.\n  - **UIView+ADKGetUIViewController** > Supports get any view\'s UIViewController.\n  - **UIColor+ADKHexPresentation** > Supports HEX color format and color shift.\n  - **ADKViewExclusiveTouch** > Supports exclusive touch on each sub views.\n\n\n### UI Tools\n\n  - **UIView+ADKAutoLayoutSupport** > Supports command autolayout features.\n \xc2\xa0- **UIScrollView+ADKPullToRefreshView** > Supports pull to refresh feature on scrollable view.
