It is designed for helping assess mobile\napplications by implementing dynamic function hooking and intercepting and\nintended to make Frida script writing as simple as possible.*\n\n## TL;DR\n~~~\ngit clone https://github.com/nccgroup/house\npip install pipenv\npipenv install\npipenv shell\npython app.py <PORT>\n\n# or:\nmkvirtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3 house\nworkon house\npip install -r requirements.txt\npython app.py <PORT>\n~~~\nBy default, House binds to http://127.0.0.1:8000.\n\n\nTo get an overview of House capabilities, you can visit [user\'s manual](https://github.com/nccgroup/house/wiki/Overview) for details.\n\n## News\n- House now runs on **python3**, as python2 will retire in 2019.\n- Added Monitor tab, inspired by [Inspeckage](https://github.com/ac-pm/Inspeckage).\n\n\n## Example Usage\n\nIn this section, a small example is provided to illustrate basic usage of\nHouse. The demo case is performed against a small testing android application:\n[`com.ha0k3.overloads`](./test_apk/overloads.apk).\n\n#### Start\n- Make sure an Android device is plugged in over USB and Frida server is\nrunning on the device. Check the Frida server is successfully spawned using the\nfollowing command: `frida-ps -U`.\n\n- Start the House application by running app.py : `python app.py <PORT>`. \n\n- Open a browser and navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:PORT>.\n\n- Observe the device information is displayed on the page, if not, click the\n  `Refresh` button or restart the application and Frida server.\n  \t![start.gif](./gifs/start.gif)\n  \t\n#### Monitor\n- Dynamically generating hook script from templates based on the [config file](https://github.com/nccgroup/house/blob/master/scripts/monitor/monitor_hook.json), monitor key operations including FILEIO, IPC, etc. \n\n\n![monitor.png](./gifs/monitor.png)\n\n- It is experimental at this point, If you find more functions needed to be hooked, feel free to let me know or file a PR.\n\n\n#### Preload & Sideload\n- House now support `sideload`. It supports stetho side loading at this point; which makes it easier for us to examine the UI; storage; etc.\n    ![sideload_stetho.png](./gifs/sideload_stetho.png)\n- It is experimental at this point, but more functionalities such as SSLStrip will be added under this tab.\n    \n\n#### Enumeration\n- *Enumerate all loaded classes:*\n\t![enum_load.gif](./gifs/enum_load.gif)\n- *Enumerate all classes in the Dex file:*\n\t![enum_dex.gif](./gifs/enum_dex.gif)\n- *Enumerates all methods within a given class*\n\t![enum_method1.gif](./gifs/enum_method1.gif)\n\t![enum_method2.gif](./gifs/enum_method2.gif)\n- *History Scripts management*\n\t![enum_history_script.gif](./gifs/enum_history_script.gif)\n\t\n#### Multiple Function Tracing\n- *Scripts rendering and Function Tracing*\n\t![hook.gif](./gifs/hook.gif)\n\t\n- *History Scripts management*\n\t![hook_history_script.gif](./gifs/hook_history_script.gif)\n\t\n\t\n#### Function intercepting\n- Via House, researchers can dynamically change the arguments being passed to\n  the target functions and forward it.\n\t![int1.gif](./gifs/int1.gif)\n\n- Sometimes House cannot perfectly parse argument informations. For example, an\n  arguments can be with special type. In the example app, it implemented\n  `isLit` function that takes customized object as its argument. To tackle\n  those situations, a simple "REPL" is provided by House. Security researchers\n  can dynamically type in Frida script in the REPL and modify the function\n  behaviors.\n\t![int2.gif](./gifs/int2.gif)\n\t\n- Several REPL functions were provided by House to make the testing easier:\n\t- `inspectObject(obj)` uses `java.lang.reflect` to inspect fields information within an object.\n\t- `setRetval(ret)` takes a parameter and will try to cast it to the correct return type using the original return value\'s constructor.\n    - `getStackTrace()` will print the stack trace.\n\t- More REPL functions will be added in the future.\n\n\t![int3.gif](./gifs/int3.gif)\n\n**Note:** For constructor method hooking/intercept, input `$init` as method name.\n\n## FAQ \n#### Prerequisite:\n\nTo make House work; you would need:\n\n1. A rooted android device with frida-server running plugged in your computer, use only one USB device is recommended.\n2. Local frida-python version matches frida-server\'s.\n\n\n#### Cannot get device? Does not work?\nAlso please try to restart **both** the frida server and House, if still not working, please file an issue.\n\n#### Time out error?\nOften occues when there are multiple USB devices connected, try to restart the target application.\n\n#### Frida error?\nHouse has been tested using Frida version 12.6.8; there might be some issues with some other versions, also make sure frida-python matches frida-server\'s version. If still not working, try to run the generated frida scripts manually to see if it works.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to following open-source projects for inspirations on House:\n\n1.
