b'# CTF Wiki\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ctf-wiki/ctf-wiki.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ctf-wiki/ctf-wiki)\n[![Requirements Status](https://requires.io/github/ctf-wiki/ctf-wiki/requirements.svg?branch=master)](https://requires.io/github/ctf-wiki/ctf-wiki/requirements/?branch=master)\n[![Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-join%20chat-brightgreen.svg)](https://join.slack.com/t/ctf-wiki/shared_invite/enQtNTkwNDg5NDUzNzAzLWExOTRhZTE0ZTMzYjVlNDk5OGI3ZDA1NmQyZjE4NWRlMGU3NjEwM2Y2ZTliMTg4Njg1MjliNWRhNTk2ZmY0NmI)\n\n[\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87](./README-zh_CN.md)  [English](./README.md)\n\nWelcome to **CTF Wiki**\xef\xbc\x81\n\n**CTF** (Capture The Flag) started from **DEFCON CTF**, a competitive game among computer security enthusiasts, originally hosted in 1996.\n\n**CTF** covers a wide range of fields. Along with the evolving security technology, the difficulty of **CTF** challenges is getting harder and harder. As a result, the learning curve for beginners is getting steeper. Most online information is scattered and trivial. Beginners often don\'t know how to systematically learn **CTF**, which requires a lot of work and effort.\n\nIn order to let those people who are interested in **CTF**s start easily, in October 2016, **CTF Wiki** was establisged on Github. Along with gradually improved content over time, **CTF Wiki** has received lots of appreciation from security enthusiasts, many of those are guys that we think we would never meet.\n\nAs a freedom site, primarily focusing on recent CTFs, **CTF Wiki** introduces the knowledge and techniques in all aspects of **CTF** to make it easier for beginners to learn **CTF**.\n\nNow, **CTF Wiki** mainly contains the basic skill-set for **CTF**, but we are working hard to improve the following contents.\n\n- Advanced skills used in CTF\n- Special topics appearing in CTF\n\nFor the above-mentioned parts to be improved, please refer to [Projects](https://github.com/ctf-wiki/ctf-wiki/projects) which details what are planned.\n\nAlthough now **CTF Wiki** mainly focus **CTF**, it is not strictly limited to **CTF** topics. In the future, **CTF Wiki** will include\n\n- Tools used in security research\n- Increased discussion of security in the world\n\nIn addition, given the following two points\n\n- Information about technology should be openly shared.\n- As new techniques are always being developed, old techniques will start to fade over time and they should be replaced with new techniques.\n\nTherefore, **CTF Wiki** will never publish books.\n\nFinally, originating from the community, as an independent organization, **CTF Wiki** advocates **freedom of knowledge**, will **never be commercialized**, and will always maintain the character of **independence and freedom**.\n\n## How to build\xef\xbc\x9f\n\nCTF Wiki uses [mkdocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs) to show its contents. And it is deployed at [https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/](https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/).\n\nIt can also be deployed locally, with the following steps:\n\n```shell\n# 1. clone\ngit clone https://github.com/ctf-wiki/ctf-wiki.git\n# 2. requirements\npip install -r requirements.txt\n# generate static file in site/\nmkdocs build\n# deploy at http://127.0.0.1:8000\nmkdocs serve\n```\n\n** A local instance of mkdocs is dynamically updated, for instance when a markdown file is modified, the corresponding page will be modified too.**\n\nIf you just want to view it statically, try Docker!\n\n```\ndocker run -d --name=ctf-wiki -p 4100:80 ctfwiki/ctf-wiki\n```\nAnd then access [http://localhost:4100/](http://localhost:4100/) .\n\n## How to practice\xef\xbc\x9f\n\nFirstly, learn some basic security knowledge through online reading.\n\nSecondly, CTF Wiki has two sister projects.\n\n- All of the challenges that are mentioned are in the [ctf-challenges](https://github.com/ctf-wiki/ctf-challenges) repository, you can locate them with their corresponding category.\n  - Note: There are still some topics that are still being migrated. . . (misc, web)\n- The tools mentioned in the CTF Wiki are constantly added to the [ctf-tools](https://github.com/ctf-wiki/ctf-tools) repository.\n\n## How to make CTF Wiki Better\xef\xbc\x9f\n\nWe welcome to write content for the wiki and share what you have learned. \n\n**Before you decide to contribute content, please read [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/ctf-wiki/ctf-wiki/wiki/Contributing-Guide)**.\n\nThank you to all the people who have already contributed to CTF Wiki.\n\n<a href="https://github.com/ctf-wiki/ctf-wiki/graphs/contributors"><img src="https://opencollective.com/ctf-wiki/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false" />\n\n## What can you get?\n\n- Ability to learn new things quickly\n- Different ways of thinking\n- A love for solving problems\n- Interesting security techniques\n- Memorable and enriching experience\n\nBefore reading the Wiki, we hope to give you some advice:\n\n- Learn to ask [smart-questions](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) .\n- Learn to use Google Search for self-improvement.\n- Be good at least one programming language, such as Python.\n- Practice is the most important learning tool.\n- Maintain the passions and desire to learn about new techniques.\n\nThe security circle is small and the areas of exploration is vast. Let\'s get started with **CTF Wiki**!\n'
