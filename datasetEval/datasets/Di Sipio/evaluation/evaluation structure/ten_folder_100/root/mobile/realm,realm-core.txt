b'![Realm](doc/logo.png)\n\nRealm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables - check out [realm.io](https://realm.io). \n\nThis repository holds the source code for the core database component used by all the Realm Mobile Database products:\n[realm-java](https://github.com/realm/realm-java), [realm-cocoa](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa), [realm-js](https://github.com/realm/realm-js) and [realm-dotnet](https://github.com/realm/realm-dotnet). Realm Core is not in itself an "end-user" product with a publicly stable and supported API. It is the intention to build a publicly supported C++ API (see [this issue](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/issues/1954)), but that will be a separate product and likely build on top of [realm-object-store](https://github.com/realm/realm-object-store).\n\n## Building Realm\n\nHow to build Realm Core is described [here](how-to-build.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details!\n\nThis project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://realm.io/conduct).\nBy participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
