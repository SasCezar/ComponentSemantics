Its comprehensive query language and SQL functions enable new and creative ways to query your relational data.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, ZomboDB is a 100% native Postgres extension that implements Postgres\' Index Access Method API.  As a native Postgres index type, ZomboDB allows you to `CREATE INDEX ... USING zombodb` on your existing Postgres tables.  At that point, ZomboDB takes over and fully manages the remote Elasticsearch index and guarantees transactionally-correct text-search query results.\n\nZomboDB is fully compatible with all of Postgres\' query plan types and most SQL commands such as `CREATE INDEX`, `COPY`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `REINDEX`, `(auto)VACUUM`, etc.\n\nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if you\xe2\x80\x99re using an Elasticsearch cloud provider or managing your own cluster -- ZomboDB communicates with Elasticsearch via its RESTful APIs so you\xe2\x80\x99re covered either way.\n\nZomboDB allows you to use the power and scalability of Elasticsearch directly from Postgres.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to manage transactions between Postgres and Elasticsearch, asynchronous indexing pipelines, complex reindexing processes, or multiple data-access code paths -- ZomboDB does it all for you.\n\n\n## Quick Links\n\n - [Installation from Binaries](BINARY-INSTALLATION.md) ([sponsors only](https://github.com/sponsors/eeeebbbbrrrr))\n - [Installation from Source](SOURCE-INSTALLATION.md) (everyone)\n - [Getting Started Tutorial](TUTORIAL.md)\n - [Important Things to Know](THINGS-TO-KNOW.md)\n - [Creating Indexes](CREATE-INDEX.md)\n - [Query DSL](QUERY-DSL.md)\n - [Aggregations](AGGREGATIONS.md), [Table Samplers](TABLE-SAMPLERS.md), [Scoring and Highlighting](SCORING-HIGHLIGHTING.md)\n - [SQL Functions](SQL-FUNCTIONS.md)\n - [Configuration Settings](CONFIGURATION-SETTINGS.md), [Index Managment](INDEX-MANAGEMENT.md)\n - [Type Mapping](TYPE-MAPPING.md)\n - [Elasticsearch _cat API](CAT-API.md)\n - [VACUUM Support](VACUUM.md)\n\n \n## Features\n\n - MVCC-correct text-search and aggregation results\n - Managed and queried via standard SQL\n - Works with current Elasticsearch releases (no plugins required)\n - Query using\n    - Elasticsearch\'s [Query String Syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax)\n    - Raw Elasticsearch QueryDSL JSON\n    - ZomboDB\'s type-safe [query builder SQL syntax](QUERY-DSL.md)\n    - Any combination of the above, even in combination with standard SQL\n - [Scoring and Highlighting Support](SCORING-HIGHLIGHTING.md)\n - [Support for all Elasticsearch aggregations](AGGREGATIONS.md)\n - Automatic Elasticsearch Mapping Generation\n    - Ability to map custom domains\n    - Per-field custom mappings\n    - `json/jsonb` automatically mapped as dynamic nested objects\n    - Supports full set of [Elasticsearch language analyzers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-lang-analyzer.html)\n - Hot-Standby compatible\n - Support for indexing & searching [PostGIS `geometry` and `geography` types](POSTGIS-SUPPORT.md)\n\n\n## Current Limitations\n\n - Only one ZomboDB index per table\n - ZomboDB indexes with predicates (ie, [partial indexes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/indexes-partial.html)) are not supported\n - `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is not supported\n\nThese limitations may be addressed in future versions of ZomboDB.\n\n\n## System Requirements\n \n Product       | Version \n---           | ---      \nPostgres      | 10.x, 11.x\nElasticsearch | 5.6.x, 6.x\nlibcurl       | >=7.28.0\n\n\n## Sponsorship and Downloads\n\nPlease see https://github.com/sponsors/eeeebbbbrrrr for sponsorship details.

Please read the [getting started tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) for more details.\n\nCreate the extension:\n\n```sql\nCREATE EXTENSION zombodb;\n```\n\nCreate a table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE products (\n    id SERIAL8 NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\n    name text NOT NULL,\n    keywords varchar(64)[],\n    short_summary text,\n    long_description zdb.fulltext, \n    price bigint,\n    inventory_count integer,\n    discontinued boolean default false,\n    availability_date date\n);\n\n-- insert some data\n```\n\nCreate a ZomboDB index:\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX idxproducts \n          ON products \n       USING zombodb ((products.*)) \n        WITH (url=\'localhost:9200/\');\n```\n\nQuery it:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * \n  FROM products \n WHERE products ==> \'(keywords:(sports OR box) OR long_description:"wooden away"~5) AND price:[1000 TO 20000]\';\n```\n\n\n## Contact Information\n\n - https://www.zombodb.com\n - Google Group: zombodb@googlegroups.com\n - Twitter: [@zombodb](https://twitter.com/zombodb/)\n - via Github Issues and Pull Requests\n - https://www.zombodb.com/services/ or info@zombodb.com for commercial support\n\n## Older Versions\n\nThis version of ZomboDB supports Postgres 10 and 11 and doesn\'t require an Elasticsearch plugin.  \n\nPrevious versions that support Postgres <=9.5, and require an Elasticsearch plugin, are still available, from these branches:\n\n- [Support for Elasticsearch 5.6](https://github.com/zombodb/zombodb/tree/master-es5.6) (active)\n- [Support for Elasticsearch 2.4](https://github.com/zombodb/zombodb/tree/master-es2.4) (unsupported)\n- [Support for Elasticsearch 1.7](https://github.com/zombodb/zombodb/tree/master-es1.7) (unsupported)\n\nCommerical support for all versions of ZomboDB is available by [contacting ZomboDB, LLC](https://www.zombodb.com/services/).\n\n\n \n## History\n\nThe name is an homage to zombo.com and its long history of continuous self-affirmation.\n\nThis version of ZomboDB was graciously sponsored by [Impira](http://impira.com).\n\nHistorically, ZomboDB began in 2013 by Technology Concepts & Design, Inc as a closed-source effort to provide transaction safe text-search on top of Postgres tables. While Postgres\' "tsearch" features are useful, they\'re not necessarily adequate for 200 column-wide tables with 100M rows, each containing large text content.\n\nInitially designed on-top of Postgres\' Foreign Data Wrapper API, ZomboDB quickly evolved into an index type so that queries are MVCC-safe and standard SQL can be used to query and manage indices.\n\nElasticsearch was chosen as the backing search index because of its horizontal scaling abilities, performance, and general ease of use.\n\nZomboDB was open-sourced in July 2015 and has since been used in numerous production systems of various sizes and complexity.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2018-2019 ZomboDB, LLC\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n'
