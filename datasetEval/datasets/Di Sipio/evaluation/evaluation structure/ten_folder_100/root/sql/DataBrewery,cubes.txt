b"Cubes - Online Analytical Processing Framework for Python\n=========================================================\n\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/DataBrewery/cubes](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/DataBrewery/cubes?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n[![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=Stiivi&url=https://github.com/databrewery/cubes&title=Cubes&language=&tags=github&category=software)\n\nCubes is a light-weight Python framework and set of tools for Online\nAnalytical Processing (OLAP), multidimensional analysis and browsing of\naggregated data.\n\n*Focus on data analysis, in human way*\n\n\nOverview\n========\n\nPurpose is to provide a framework for giving analyst or any application\nend-user understandable and natural way of presenting the multidimensional\ndata. One of the main features is the logical model, which serves as\nabstraction over physical data to provide end-user layer.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* OLAP and aggregated browsing (default backend is for relational databse -\n  ROLAP)\n* multidimensional analysis\n* logical view of analysed data - how analysts look at data, how they think of\n  data, not not how the data are physically implemented in the data stores\n* hierarchical dimensions (attributes that have hierarchical dependencies,\n  such as category-subcategory or country-region)\n* localizable metadata and data\n* SQL query generator for multidimensional aggregation queries\n* OLAP server \xe2\x80\x93 HTTP server based on Flask Blueprint, can be [easily\n  integrated](http://pythonhosted.org/cubes/deployment.html) into your\n  application.\n\nDownload\n========\n\nCurrent recommended version is 1.1.x. It hasn't been yet tagged so please use the *master* branch.\nThis version includes SQL backend support out of the box, and other backends have been moved to separate\nprojects (ie. MongoDB). This branch (currently *master*) will be soon tagged as 1.1 release.\n\nPrevious stable version was 1.0.1. This version included all backend types, but no further\ndevelopment will be done on this branch.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\n[Latest documentation](http://cubes.readthedocs.org/en/latest)\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nSee `examples` directory in the source code repository\nfor simple examples and use-cases.\n\nSee https://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes-examples\nfor more complex examples.\n\nModels\n------\n\nFor cubes models see\nhttps://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes-models\n\n\nDevelopment\n============\n\nSource code is in a Git repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes)\n\n    git clone git://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes\n\nAfter you've cloned, you might want to install all of the development dependencies.\n\n    pip install -e .[dev]\n\nBuild the documentation like so. ::\n\n    cd doc\n    make help\n    make html\n\nOutputs will go in ``doc/_*``.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nPython >= 2.7 and Python >= 3.4.1\n\nMost of the requirements are soft (optional) and need to be satisfied only if\ncertain parts of cubes are being used.\n\n* SQLAlchemy from http://www.sqlalchemy.org/ version >= 0.7.4 - for SQL\n  backend\n* Flask from http://flask.pocoo.org/ for Slicer server\n* Jinja2 from http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/ for HTML presenters\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nIf you have questions, problems or suggestions, you can send a message to the\n[Google group cubes-discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/cubes-discuss).\n\nIRC channel #databrewery on server irc.freenode.net\n\nReport bugs using [github issue\ntracking](https://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes/issues).\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nIf you are browsing the code and you find something that:\n\n* is over-complicated or not obvious\n* is redundant\n* can be done in better Python-way\n\n... please let it be known.\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\nCubes is written and maintained by Stefan Urbanek (@Stiivi on Twitter)\n<stefan.urbanek@gmail.com> and various contributors.
