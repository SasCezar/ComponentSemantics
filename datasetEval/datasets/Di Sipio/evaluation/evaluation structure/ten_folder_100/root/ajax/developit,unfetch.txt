It will fetch resources from `url` according to the given `options`, returning a Promise that will eventually resolve to the response.\n\nUnfetch will account for the following properties in `options`:\n  \n  * `method`: Indicates the request method to be performed on the\n   target resource (The most common ones being `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS` or `DELETE`).\n  * `headers`: An `Object` containing additional information to be sent with the request, e.g. `{ \'Content-Type\': \'application/json\' }` to indicate a JSON-typed request body.\n  * `credentials`: \xe2\x9a\xa0 Accepts a `"include"` string, which will allow both CORS and same origin requests to work with cookies. As pointed in the [\'Caveats\' section](#caveats), Unfetch won\'t send or receive cookies otherwise. The `"same-origin"` value is not supported. \xe2\x9a\xa0\n  * `body`: The content to be transmited in request\'s body. Common content types include `FormData`, `JSON`, `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer` or plain text.\n\n### `response` Methods and Attributes\nThese methods are used to handle the response accordingly in your Promise chain. Instead of implementing full spec-compliant [Response Class](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response-class) functionality, Unfetch provides the following methods and attributes:\n\n#### `response.ok`\nReturns `true` if the request received a status in the `OK` range (200-299).\n\n#### `response.status`\nContains the status code of the response, e.g. `404` for a not found resource, `200` for a success.\n\n#### `response.statusText`\nA message related to the `status` attribute, e.g. `OK` for a status `200`.\n\n#### `response.clone()`\nWill return another `Object` with the same shape and content as `response`.\n\n#### `response.text()`, `response.json()`, `response.blob()`\nWill return the response content as plain text, JSON and `Blob`, respectively.\n\n#### `response.headers`\nAgain, Unfetch doesn\'t implement a full spec-compliant [`Headers Class`](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#headers), emulating some of the Map-like functionality through its own functions:\n  * `headers.keys`: Returns an `Array` containing the `key` for every header in the response.\n  * `headers.entries`: Returns an `Array` containing the `[key, value]` pairs for every `Header` in the response.\n  * `headers.get(key)`: Returns the `value` associated with the given `key`.\n  * `headers.has(key)`: Returns a `boolean` asserting the existence of a `value` for the given `key` among the response headers.\n\n## Caveats\n\n_Adapted from the GitHub fetch polyfill [**readme**](https://github.com/github/fetch#caveats)._\n\nThe `fetch` specification differs from `jQuery.ajax()` in mainly two ways that\nbear keeping in mind:\n\n* By default, `fetch` **won\'t send or receive any cookies** from the server,\n  resulting in unauthenticated requests if the site relies on maintaining a user\n  session.\n\n```javascript\nfetch(\'/users\', {\n  credentials: \'include\'\n});\n```\n\n* The Promise returned from `fetch()` **won\'t reject on HTTP error status**\n  even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, it will resolve normally,\n  and it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the\n  request from completing.\n\n  To have `fetch` Promise reject on HTTP error statuses, i.e. on any non-2xx\n  status, define a custom response handler:\n\n```javascript\nfetch(\'/users\')\n  .then( checkStatus )\n  .then( r => r.json() )\n  .then( data => {\n    console.log(data);\n  });\n\nfunction checkStatus(response) {\n  if (response.ok) {\n    return response;\n  } else {\n    var error = new Error(response.statusText);\n    error.response = response;\n    return Promise.reject(error);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* * *\n\n## Contribute\n\nFirst off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!\nNow, take a moment to be sure your contributions make sense to everyone else.\n\n### Reporting Issues\n\nFound a problem?
