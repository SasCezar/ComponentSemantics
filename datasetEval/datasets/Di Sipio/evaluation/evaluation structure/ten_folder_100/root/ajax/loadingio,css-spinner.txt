The simplest usage is as:\n\n1. Find and download the html file of desired loader under [build/](https://github.com/loadingio/css-spinner/tree/master/build) folder.\n2. Copy its content to the place you want to use this loader.\n3. Done.\n\nSeparated CSS and HTML files are also available under [build](https://github.com/loadingio/css-spinner/tree/master/build) folder so that you can reuse the css to reduce payload size.\n\nWe also provide stylus and pug source files for better integrating these spinners into your project. Find corresponding stylus and pug files for your desired spinners under [src/](https://github.com/loadingio/css-spinner/tree/master/src) folders.\n\nAdditionally, you will need [vars.styl](https://github.com/loadingio/css-spinner/blob/master/vars.styl) and [basic.styl](https://github.com/loadingio/css-spinner/blob/master/basic.styl) if you are going to build by yourself. See following section for more detail.\n\n\n## Customization\n\nTo customize speed and color of a loader, first ensure you have stylus install locally ( you will need npm too ):\n\n    npm install -g stylus\n\n\nthen, edit vars.styl with your desired configuration. for now you can edit the following style of a spinner:\n\n * size\n * color\n * speed\n\n\nonce you've done with the editing, run stylus to build yourself a css file:\n\n    stylus -o . --import vars.styl --import basic.styl src/<desired-loader>/main.styl\n\n\nuse the generated main.css together with build/<desired-loader>/main.html to add this loader in your project.\n\n\nBrowser Compatibility\n----------------\n\nThese spinners use CSS Animation and Transformation which is widely supported by major modern browsers except IE<=9.  To support older browsers like IE9, please use [loading.io](https://loading.io/animation/icon/) to generate alternative GIF Loaders instead.\n\n\n\nLicense\n----------------\n\nAll loader files here are released under CC0 License.
