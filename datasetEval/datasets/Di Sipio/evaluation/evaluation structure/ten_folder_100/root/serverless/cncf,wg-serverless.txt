b'# CNCF Serverless WG\n\nThe original intent of the CNCF Serverless Working Group was to explore the\nintersection of cloud native and serverless technology. As a result of that\nwork the following artifacts were produced:\n\n* [A Serverless Overview Whitepaper](#serverless-overview-whitepaper)\n* [Landscape](#landscape)\n\nSince then the CNCF TOC agreed to have the working group continue its work\nand develop the\n[CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md)\nspecification. That work is being done in a separate github repo:\n[CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec).\n\nIn addition to [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md)\nspecification, the Serverless WG has agreed to form a sub working group to\nwork on a separate stream called "Event Function Workflow". This work is\nbeing done in the [Workflow](https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless/tree/master/workflow/spec)\ndirectory.\n\nAdditional work streams can be suggested, see the proposal directory\'s\n[README](proposals/README.md) for more information.\n\nThe TOC sponsor of this WG is Ken Owens.\n\n### Non-Goals\nIdentify one serverless project to rule them all.\n\n## Communications\n\nThe mailing list for e-mail communications:\n- Send emails to: [cncf-wg-serverless](mailto:cncf-wg-serverless@lists.cncf.io)\n- To subscribe see: https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-wg-serverless\n\nAnd a #serverless Slack channel:\n[https://slack.cncf.io/](https://slack.cncf.io/)\n\n## Landscape\n\n![Serverless Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/images/serverless.png)\n\nYou can open up suggestions and issues with the landscape here: https://github.com/cncf/landscape.\n\n## Interactive Landscape\n\nPlease see the new interactive [version](https://landscape.cncf.io/format=serverless) of the landscape.
