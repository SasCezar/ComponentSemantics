It abstracts away complicated infrastructure and leaves developers with very simple, but powerful building blocks that handle scale transparently.\n\n#### How does it work?\n\nFirst, **you create your component**. It can contain logic to get some data (using node.js) and then the view, including css and js. It can be what you want, including *React* or *Angular* components or whatever you like.\n\nThen, **you publish it** to the OpenComponents registry and you wait a couple of seconds while the registry prepares your stuff to be production-ready.\n\nNow, every web app in your private or public network can **consume the component** via its own HTTP endpoint during server-side rendering or just in the browser.\n\nWe have been using it for more than two years in production at OpenTable, for shared components, third party widgets, e-mails and more.
