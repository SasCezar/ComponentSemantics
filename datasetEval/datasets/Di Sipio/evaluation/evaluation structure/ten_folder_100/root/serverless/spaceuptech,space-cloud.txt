CockroachDB, Yugabyte, etc.)\n- **MySQL** and MySQL compatible databases (For eg. TiDB, MariaDB, etc.)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [Client-side tooling](#client-side-tooling)\n- [How it works](#how-it-works)\n- [Support & Troubleshooting](#support--troubleshooting)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Quick start\n\n### Using Docker Compose\n\nDocker Compose is the easiest way to get started with Space Cloud. Let\'s see how to quickly get started with MongoDB and Space Cloud using Docker Compose.\n\n> **Note:** MongoDB is not a dependency of Space Cloud. Space Cloud can run with any of it\'s supported databases.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)\n- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)\n\n1. Get the docker-compose file.\n\n```bash\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spaceuptech/space-cloud/master/install-manifests/quick-start/docker-compose/mongo/docker-compose.yaml\n```\n\n2. Run Space Cloud & MongoDB.\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\n3. Head over to http://localhost:4122/mission-control to open Mission Control and configure Space Cloud.\n\n4. Create a project.\n\n5. Head over to the Database section in Mission Control and edit the connection string to `mongodb://mongo:27017` in the connection string.\n\n6. Head over to the `Explorer` section and follow this guide to [insert and read data via Space Cloud using GraphQL](https://docs.spaceuptech.com/getting-started/quick-start/explore-graphql).\n\n### Other guides\n\nTo get started with Space Cloud without Docker compose, check out the [manual](https://docs.spaceuptech.com/getting-started/quick-start/manual) guide. For production settings, check out the [deployments](https://docs.spaceuptech.com/getting-started/deployment) guide.\n\n## Client-side tooling\nSpace Cloud exposes GraphQL and REST APIs. See [setting up project](https://docs.spaceuptech.com/getting-started/setting-up-project) guide to choose a client and set it up. \n\n### GraphQL APIs\nGraphQL is the recommended way to use Space cloud, and it works with any GraphQL client. However, we recommend using [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client). See [awesome-graphql](https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql) for a list of clients.\n\n### REST APIs\n\nYou can use the [REST APIs of Space Cloud](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/YourTechBud/space-cloud/0.12.0) if you are more comfortable with REST. \n\nTo make it easy to consume the REST APIs in web projects, we have created a [**Javascript SDK**](https://docs.spaceuptech.com/getting-started/setting-up-project/javascript) for you.\n\n## How it works\n\nSpace Cloud is meant to replace any backend php, nodejs, java code you may write to create your endpoints. Instead, it _exposes your database over an external API_ that can be consumed directly from the frontend. In other words, it **allows clients to fire database queries directly**.\n\nHowever, it\'s important to note that **the client does not send database (SQL) queries** to Space Cloud. Instead, it sends an object describing the query to be executed. This object is first **validated** by Space Cloud (using security rules). Once the client is authorized to make the request, **a database query is dynamically generated and executed**. The results are sent directly to the concerned client.\n\nWe understand that not every app can be built using only CRUD operations. Sometimes it\'s necessary to write business logic. For such cases, Space Cloud allows you to access your **custom HTTP servers** via the same consistent APIs of Space Cloud.  In this scenario, Space Cloud acts merely as an API gateway between your `remote-services` and the client. However, the cool part is that you can even perform **joins on your remote services and database** via the GraphQL API of Space Cloud\n\n<div style="text-align: center">\n<img src="https://spaceuptech.com/icons/space-cloud-detailed.png"  style="max-width: 80%" alt="Detailed Space Cloud architecture" />\n</div>\n\nApart from these, Space Cloud also integrates with tons of cloud technologies to give you several other features like `realtime database` (changes in the database are synced with all concerned clients in realtime), `file storage`, etc.\n\n## Support & Troubleshooting\n\nThe documentation and community should help you troubleshoot most issues.
