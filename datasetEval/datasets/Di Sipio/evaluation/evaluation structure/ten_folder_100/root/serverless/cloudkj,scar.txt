b'SCAR: 1-click static website deployment on AWS\n==============================================\n\nTired of reading outdated blog posts or combing through verbose AWS\ndocumentation just to figure out how to deploy your blog? Deploying static\nwebsites on AWS shouldn\'t be so *scar*y.\n\n**SCAR** is a deployment stack that make it easy for you to deploy a\nstatic website with a custom domain, SSL, and a CDN. All you need is an AWS\naccount to get started in three simple steps:\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\n#### 1. Launch a new stack using the AWS console to create all the required resources\n\n[![Launch stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=SCAR&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudkj/scar_base_template.json)\n\n#### 2. Update the settings at your domain registrar to use the Route 53 name servers\n\nFind the name servers from your newly created [Route 53 hosted zone](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home?#hosted-zones:),\nthen update the [name server settings at your registrar](#name-server-settings).\n\n#### 3. Validate the domain for your new [ACM certificate](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home)\n\nFind and expand the details of the certificate for your domain in the AWS console, then click the\n*"Create record in Route 53"* buttons in the two prompts for validation.\n\n**_That\'s all, folks!_**\n\nUse the [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)\nconsole to check the status of the stack. Once it has been created, navigate to\nyour given domain, and you should see the SCAR welcome page.  You can now upload\nthe contents of your website directly with the [S3\nconsole](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home), or use the [AWS\nCLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) for programmatic control.\n\nStack\n-----\n\n![SCAR stack](src/cloudformation/scar_base_template.png)[]()\n\n**SCAR** is a deployment stack for static websites running entirely on AWS, using **S**3,\n**C**loudFront, **A**mazon Certificate Manager, and **R**oute 53. For a given\ndomain such as `example.com`, the default SCAR stack will create the following:\n\n* Two S3 buckets, one for storing the contents of your static website\n  (`www.example.com`) and another for redirecting requests for the apex domain\n  (`example.com`) to the `www` subdomain.\n* Two CloudFront distributions, one for each S3 bucket.\n* One ACM public SSL/TLS certificate for both `example.com` and `*.example.com`\n* One Route 53 hosted zone, with an `A` record for each CloudFront distribution.\n\nThe behavior for the default SCAR stack is to redirect all requests for the apex\ndomain to the `www` subdomain, and to redirect all `http` requests to `https`.\nAll content will be stored in and served out of the `www` S3 bucket.\n\nAdditional stacks with slight variations from the default stack are also\navailable:\n\n| Behavior | Default | WWW->Apex | Apex only |\n|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| Apex domain requests | Redirect to `www` | | |\n| `www` subdomain requests | | Redirect to apex domain | N/A |\n| `http` requests | Redirect to `https` | Redirect to `https` | Redirect to `https` |\n| | [![Launch stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=SCAR&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudkj/scar_base_template.json) | (Coming Soon) | (Coming Soon) |\n\nName Server Settings\n--------------------\n\n* [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/help/change-nameservers-for-my-domains-664)\n* [Google Domains](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3290309?hl=en)\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### How much will this cost?\n\nFor most sites, it will likely cost less than $1 per month. The cost for a Route 53 hosted zone is fixed at $0.50/month; the remaining CloudFront and S3 costs depend on the levels of traffic, but typically amount to a few cents for small levels of traffic.\n\n### What tool did you use to draw the diagram above?\n\nThe [AWS CloudFormation Designer tool](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/designer/home) allows drag-and-drop creation of templates, and also creates diagrams from existing JSON or YAML template files.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nTODO:\n\n* Additional templates for bare domain only, www->root\n* Include certificate validation using CNAME DNS record as part of template.\n  Until official CloudFormation support, potential solutions:\n  * https://binx.io/blog/2018/10/05/automated-provisioning-of-acm-certificates-using-route53-in-cloudformation/\n  * https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cdk/pull/1797\n* Add custom resource to delete the CNAME DNS record used for validation in\n  Route 53 hosted zone\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2019\n'
