b'Cognito Quickstart\n===================================================\n#### Creator: Vladimir Budilov\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vbudilov/)\n* [Medium](https://medium.com/@budilov)\n\n## What does this app do?\n![QuickStart Angular2 Cognito App](/aws/meta/Cognito-Angular2-QuickStart.png?raw=true)\n\n## Tech Stack\n### Required Tools\n* [aws cli](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)\n* [eb cli](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html)\n* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)\n* [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)\n\n### Frameworks\n* [AWS JavaScript SDK](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/browser-intro.html)\n* [Angular 2](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html)\n    * [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html)\n* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)\n\n## AWS Setup\n##### Install the required tools (the installation script only runs on Linux and Mac)\n* Create an AWS account\n* Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)\n* [Install or update your aws cli](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) \n* [Install or update your eb cli](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html) \n* [Install angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)\n\n\n## Getting the code and running it locally\n_This uses the pre-configured AWS resources hosted by AWS_\n\n```\n# Clone it from github\ngit clone --depth 1 git@github.com:awslabs/aws-cognito-angular2-quickstart.git\n```\n```\n# Install the NPM packages\ncd aws-cognito-angular2-quickstart\nnpm install\n```\n```\n# Run the app in dev mode\nnpm start\n```\n\n## Creating AWS Resources\nThis sample application can be deployed to either Elastic Beanstalk or S3. S3 will host this application as a static site\nwhile Elastic Beanstalk gives you the capability of adding backend operations to the application. \n\n* [What is Elastic Beanstalk](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html)\n* [What is S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html)\n\n**createResources.sh requires your [aws cli to be configured](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/controlling-output.html) for JSON output.**\n\n```\n# Install the AWS resources and deploy your application to either Elastic Beanstalk or S3\ncd aws\n./createResources.sh\n```\n\nRunning the above command will create the necessary AWS resources and build & deploy your code to AWS. \nIt will prompt you to choose your deployment target (S3 or Elastic Beanstalk). Choosing \'S3\' makes your deployment\ncompletely serverless, while choosing Elastic Beanstalk will create an EC2 instance that will host this NodeJS app. \n\n*Caution:* You might incur AWS charges after running the setup script\n\n## After initially running the ```createResources.sh``` script, use the below commands to rebuild and redeploy\n\n### _S3:_ Update, Build and Deploy\n```\n# Build the project and sync the output with the S3 bucket\nnpm run build; cd dist; aws s3 sync . s3://[BUCKET_NAME]/\n```\n```\n# Test your deployed application\ncurl \xe2\x80\x93I http://[BUCKET_NAME].s3-website-[REGION].amazonaws.com/\n```\n__*NOTE: You might want to reshuffle some of the "package.json" dependencies and move the ones that belong to devDependencies \nfor a leaner deployment bundle. At this point of time, AWS Beanstalk requires all of the dependencies, \nincluding the devDependencies to be under the dependencies section. But if you\'re not using Beanstalk then you can\noptimize as you wish.*__\n\n*or*\n\n### _Beanstalk:_ Update, Build and Deploy\n```\n# Commit your changes in order to deploy it to your environment\ngit add .\ngit commit\neb deploy\n```\n```\n# View your deployed application in a browser\neb open\n```\n\n## Local Testing\n\nThis section contains instructions on how to test the application locally (using mocked services instead of the real AWS services).\n\n### LocalStack\n\nTo test this application using [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack), you can use the `awslocal` CLI (https://github.com/localstack/awscli-local).\n```\npip install awscli-local\n```\nSimply parameterize the `./createResources.sh` installation script with `aws_cmd=awslocal`:\n```\ncd aws; aws_cmd=awslocal ./createResources.sh\n```\nOnce the code is deployed to the local S3 server, the application is accessible via http://localhost:4572/cognitosample-localapp/index.html (Assuming "localapp" has been chosen as resource name in the previous step)\n'
