b'## Kubernetes on Raspbian\n\nThis repository holds the original tutorial for "Kubernetes on Raspbian" / Raspberry Pi by Alex Ellis\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DKGfQ7bWkAAkGb9.jpg)\n\nThis guide is part of a larger blog post: [Build your own bare-metal ARM cluster](https://blog.alexellis.io/build-your-own-bare-metal-arm-cluster/).\n\n### Start the guide\n\nPick between `k3s` or `kubeadm`.\n\n#### 1) Pick `k3s` (recommended)\n\nMy current recommendation is to use [k3s](https://k3s.io) from Rancher Labs. It is normal Kubernetes and passes the conformance tests written by the CNCF. I\'m yet to be convinced of why someone wouldn\'t use this for a hobbyist build and I\'ve been pleasantly surprised by it.\n\nk3s is:\n\n* faster, and uses fewer resources\n* well-maintained and ARMHF / ARM64 just works\n* still normal, upstream, compliant Kubernetes\n* doesn\'t appear to run into some of the complicated issues we\'ve seen with `kubeadm`\n\nStart now: [Will it cluster? k3s on your Raspberry Pi](https://blog.alexellis.io/test-drive-k3s-on-raspberry-pi/)\n\n#### 2) Or pick `kubeadm`  (advanced users)\n\nMy current thinking is that only advanced users should attempt to install Kubernetes with `kubeadm`. Historically, it\'s had some unfortunate issues around timeouts and being slow.\n\n* Start the guide: [Kubernetes on (vanilla) Raspbian Lite](./GUIDE.md)\n\nOnce you\'re up and running please share your clusters on Twitter with [@alexellisuk](https://twitter.com/alexellisuk).\n\nYou can also join the OpenFaaS Slack community\'s dedicated channel for ARM and Raspberry Pi #arm-and-pi.
