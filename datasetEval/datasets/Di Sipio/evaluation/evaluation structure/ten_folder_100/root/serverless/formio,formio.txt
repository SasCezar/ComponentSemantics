This repository serves as the core Form and API engine for https://form.io. This system allows you to build "serverless" data management applications using a simple drag-and-drop form builder interface. These forms can then easily be embedded within your Angular.js and React applications using the\n```<formio>``` HTML element.\n\nWalkthrough video and tutorial\n-------------------\nFor a walkthrough tutorial on how to use this Open Source platform to build a Serverless application, watch the video [0 to M.E.A.N in 30 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2gTYkPFhPI)\n\nForm Building & Rendering Demo\n-------------------\nHere is a link to a demo of the Form Building and Form Rendering capability that can be hooked into this API platform.\n\nhttp://codepen.io/travist/full/xVyMjo/\n\nRun with Docker Compose\n------------------\nThe fastest way to run this library locally is to use [Docker](https://docker.com).\n\n - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/)\n - Download and unzip this package to a local directory on your machine.\n - Open up your terminal and navigate to the unzipped folder of this library.\n - Type the following in your terminal\n    ```\n    npm install\n    docker-compose up\n    ```\n - Go to the following URL in your browser.\n    ```\n    http://localhost:3001\n    ```\n - Use the following credentials to login.\n    - **email**: admin@example.com\n    - **password**: CHANGEME\n - To change the admin password.\n    - Once you login, click on the **Admin** resource\n    - Click **View Data**\n    - Click on the **admin@example.com** row\n    - Click **Edit Submission**\n    - Set the password field\n    - Click **Save Submission**\n    - Logout\n    \n - Have fun!\n\nManual Installation (Node + MongoDB)\n-------------------\nTo get started you will first need the following installed on your machine.\n\n  - Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/\n  - MongoDB - http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/\n    - On Mac I recomment using Homebrew ```brew install mongodb```\n    - On Windows, download and install the MSI package @ https://www.mongodb.org/downloads\n  - You must then make sure you have MongoDB running by typing ```mongod``` in your terminal.\n\nRunning with Node.js\n-------------------\nYou can then download this repository, navigate to the folder in your Terminal, and then type the following.\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis will walk you through the installation process.  When it is done, you will have a running Form.io management\napplication running at the following address in your browser.\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3001\n```\n\nThe installation process will also ask if you would like to download an application. If selected, the application can be found at the following URL.\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:8080\n```\n\nYou can also see the contents of the application (for modification) within the ```app``` folder which exists inside of the folder where you downloaded this repository.\n\nDevelopment\n--------------------\nTo start server with auto restart capability for development simply run this command:\n```\nnpm run start:dev\n```\n\nDeploy to Hosted Form.io\n--------------------\nIf you wish to deploy all of your forms and resources into the Form.io Hosted platform @ https://form.io, you can do this by using the Form.io CLI command line tool.\n\n```\nnpm install -g formio-cli\n```\n\nOnce you have this tool installed, you will need to follow these steps.\n - Create a new project within Form.io\n - Create an API Key within this project by going to the **Project Settings | Stage Settings | API Keys**\n - Next, you can execute the following command to deploy your local project into Hosted Form.io.\n \n```\nformio deploy http://localhost:3001 https://{PROJECTNAME}.form.io --dst-key={APIKEY}\n```\n\nYou will need to make sure you replace ```{PROJECTNAME}``` and ```{APIKEY}``` with your new Hosted Form.io project name (found in the API url), as well as the API key that was created in the second step above.\n\nThis will then ask you to log into the local Form.io server (which can be provided within the Admin resource), and then after it authenticates, it will export the project and deploy that project to the Form.io hosted form.\n\nHelp\n--------------------\nWe will be updating the help guides found @ https://help.form.io as questions arise and also to help you get started with Form.io.\n\nThanks for using Form.io!\n\nThe Form.io Team.\n\nSecurity\n=========\nIf you find and/or think you have found a Security issue, please quietly disclose it to security@form.io, and give us\nsufficient time to patch the issue before disclosing it publicly.\n'
