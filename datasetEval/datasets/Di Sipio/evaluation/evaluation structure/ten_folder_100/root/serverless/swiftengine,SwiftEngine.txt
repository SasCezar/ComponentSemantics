b'[![SwiftEngine](https://i.imgur.com/X6hLAmn.jpg)](https://swiftengine.io)\n\n### _We work for :star2:\xe2\x80\x99s and :fork_and_knife:\xe2\x80\x99s ... please Star our repo_\n\n:raising_hand: __Hey there!__   \nPlease note: This project is still in Alpha Version and we\xe2\x80\x99re actively working on forking over a lot of nifty features from SwiftEngine to make it compatible with SwiftNIO.   We appreciate any contributors or testers joining our project!\n\n## Features :heart_eyes:\n\n* ___Swift on Back-End___ - Improve productivity by using the modern Swift language for all your app\'s development needs ([learn more](/TechnicalOverview.md))\n* ___Hot Code Reload___ - Increase the speed of your endpoints as each file is individually compiled. If a file has not been modified since it was last used, it won\'t need to be recompiled ([learn more](/TechnicalOverview.md))\n* ___Automated Routing Logic___ - Avoid writing custom routers; SwiftEngine will automagically route each request to the desired file ([learn more](/TechnicalOverview.md))\n* ___Uptime Resiliency___ - Reduce risk by leveraging a fail-safe and high-availability operating environment where each client requests functions independently ([learn more](/TechnicalOverview.md))\n* ___Easy web based run-time error analysis___ - Save time by not having to dig through shell dumps; SwiftEngine displays the full error trace on your browser for easy debugging ([learn more](/TechnicalOverview.md))\n\n\n## Getting Started :boom:\nThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.\n\n## Prerequisites :exclamation:\nWhat are the dependencies we need to get this to work?  \n\nOS  | Version\n------------- | -------------\nmacOS | 10.13+\nUbuntu  | 14.04, 16.04, 16.10\n\n## Getting started with the project :thumbsup:\n\n1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/swiftengine/SwiftEngine.git`\n2. `cd` to `SwiftEngine` directory and run `sudo ./install.sh`\n3. Run `./run.sh`\nThis should start the server running and listening on port `8887`\n\n## Using :star:\n\nProgramming your site:\n1. Create a new `mypage.swift` file within the `/var/swiftengine/www/` directory (see example below)\n2. From the browser, enter the following url `http://<machine_ip>:8887/mypage` (by default this is `localhost:8887`)\n\nThat\'s it!  No compilation or dealing with shell dumps required!  Your requested endpoints will be automagically compiled during the first request, and results will be shown.\n\nAny swift file you place in `/var/swiftengine/www` will be accessible through the browser without the `.swift` extension.\nRead more about SwiftEngine\'s autonomous system and routing logic ([here](/TechnicalOverview.md))\n\n## Example of a SwiftEngine based `.swift` file  :trophy:\n\n```swift\n// Import SwiftEngine essentials\nimport SwiftEngine\n\n\n// specify other required files for this file\n//se: require /common.swift\n\n// Entry Point function; where all code begins\nfunc entryPoint(ctx: RequestContext) {\n\n\t// add GET handlers to the request context\n\tctx.addHandler(forMethod:"GET", withRoute:"*"){\n\t\treq, res in\n\t\tres.write("Hello from SwiftEngine!")\n\t}\n\n\t// add POST handlers to the request context\n\tctx.addHandler(forMethod:"POST", withRoute:"*"){\n\t\treq, res in\n\t\tres.write("Handle for POST request method")\n\t}\n\n\t// add catch-all handlers to the request context\n\tctx.addHandler(forMethod:"*", withRoute:"*"){\n\t\treq, res in\n\t\tres.write("Handle for catch-all")\n\t}\n\n}\n```\n\n## Built With :sunny:\n* [**SwiftNIO**](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio)\n\n\n\n## Contributing :family:\nWe would love to hear your thoughts and feedback about SwiftEngine.
