SAM CLI provides a Lambda-like execution \nenvironment that lets you locally build, test, debug, and deploy applications defined by SAM templates.\n\n* [Install SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)\n* [Build & Deploy a "Hello World" Web App](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-quick-start.html)\n* [Install AWS Toolkit](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tools-sdks/#IDE_and_IDE_Toolkits) to use SAM with your favorite IDEs.\n\n\n**Next Steps:** Learn to build a more complex serverless application.\n* [Extract text from images and store in a database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-example-s3.html) using Amazon S3 and Amazon Rekognition services.\n* [Detect when records are added to a database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-example-ddb.html) using Amazon DynamoDB database and asynchronous stream processing.\n\n\n**Detailed References:** Explains SAM commands and usage in depth.\n* [CLI Commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-command-reference.html)\n* [SAM Template Specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md)\n* [Policy Templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-policy-templates.html)\n\n## Why SAM\n\n+ **Single\\-deployment configuration**\\. SAM makes it easy to organize related components and resources, and operate on a single stack\\. You can use SAM to share configuration \\(such as memory and timeouts\\) between resources, and deploy all related resources together as a single, versioned entity\\.\n   \n+ **Local debugging and testing**\\. Use SAM CLI to locally build, test, and debug SAM applications on a Lambda-like execution environment. It tightens the development loop by helping you find & troubleshoot issues locally that you might otherwise identify only after deploying to the cloud.\n\n+ **Deep integration with development tools**. You can use SAM with a suite of tools you love and use.\n    + IDEs: [PyCharm](https://aws.amazon.com/pycharm/), [IntelliJ](https://aws.amazon.com/intellij/), [Visual Studio Code](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudiocode/), [Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/), [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)\n    + Build: [CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/)\n    + Deploy: [CodeDeploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/), [Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/AWS+SAM+Plugin)\n    + Continuous Delivery Pipelines: [CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/) \n    + Discover Serverless Apps & Patterns: [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/latest/devguide/)\n\n+ **Built\\-in best practices**\\. You can use SAM to define and deploy your infrastructure as configuration. This makes it possible for you to use and enforce best practices through code reviews. Also, with a few lines of configuration, you can enable safe deployments through CodeDeploy, and can enable tracing using AWS X\\-Ray\\.\n\n+ **Extension of AWS CloudFormation**\\. Because SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation, you get the reliable deployment capabilities of AWS CloudFormation\\. You can define resources by using CloudFormation in your SAM template\\. Also, you can use the full suite of resources, intrinsic functions, and other template features that are available in CloudFormation\\.\n\n## What is this Github repository? \xf0\x9f\x92\xbb\nThis Github Repository contains source code for SAM CLI. Here is the development team talking about this code:\n\n> SAM CLI code is written in Python. Source code is well documented, very modular, with 95% unit test coverage. \nIt uses this awesome Python library called Click to manage the command line interaction and uses Docker to run Lambda functions locally.\nWe think you\'ll like the code base. Clone it and run `make pr`!\n\n## Contribute to SAM\n\nWe love our contributors \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f We have over 100 contributors who have built various parts of the product. \nRead this [testimonial from @ndobryanskyy](https://www.lohika.com/aws-sam-my-exciting-first-open-source-experience/) to learn\nmore about what it was like contributing to SAM. \n\nDepending on your interest and skill, you can help build the different parts of the SAM project; \n\n**Enhance the SAM Specification**\n\nMake pull requests, report bugs, and share ideas to improve the full SAM template specification.\nSource code is located on Github at [awslabs/serverless-application-model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model). \nRead the [SAM Specification Contributing Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nto get started.\n    \n**Strengthen SAM CLI**\n\nAdd new commands or enhance existing ones, report bugs, or request new features for the SAM CLI.\nSource code is located on Github at [awslabs/aws-sam-cli](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli).
