b'# JAMstack\n\nThis is the small start of something. The JAMstack homepage with a few lines about the concepts and the philosophy.\n\nOver time this will hopefully grow into a useful entry-point for learning about this new stack, sharing tools, tips and best practices as well as spreading the word.\n\n## Usage\n\nBe sure that you have the latest node, yarn, and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) installed. If you need to install hugo, run:\n\n```bash\nbrew install hugo\n```\n\nNext, clone this repository and run:\n\n```bash\nyarn\nyarn start\n```\n\nThen visit http://localhost:3000/ - BrowserSync will automatically reload CSS or\nrefresh the page when stylesheets or content changes.\n\nTo build your static output to the `/dist` folder, use:\n\n```bash\nyarn build\n```\n\n## Contribute Resources (Videos & Articles)\n\nTo contribute resources to the JAMstack community, simply clone this branch and edit the `resources.yaml` in the `/site/data` directory. Just add another item (following the the prexisting syntax) and submit a pull request. If you are adding a video resource, please upload a thumbnail of the video to the `/img/videos` directory (image should be a jpeg 600px wide and 400px tall) before submitting your pull request. We will review these regularly and likely merge the addition shortly.\n\n## Contribute Examples\n\nTo contribute examples to the JAMstack community, simply clone this branch and edit the `examples.yaml` in the `/site/data` directory. Just add another item (following the the prexisting syntax). Lastly, upload a thumbnail of the site to the `/img/examples` directory (image should be a jpeg 596px wide and 396px tall) and submit a pull request. We will review these regularly and likely merge the addition shortly.\n\n## Contribute Events\n\nTo contribute events to the JAMstack community, we recommend just adding the event to your meetup and let our logic do the rest. If the event is outside of a meetup (like a conference), please manually submit it using the short guide below:\n\n1. Clone this branch and edit the `events.yaml` in the `/site/data` directory\n2. Add your event (following the the prexisting syntax)\n3. Submit a pull request\n\n*We will review these regularly and likely merge the addition shortly.\n'
