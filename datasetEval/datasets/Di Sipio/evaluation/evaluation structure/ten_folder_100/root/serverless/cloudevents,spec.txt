b"# CloudEvents\n\n![CloudEvents logo](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/blob/master/projects/cloudevents/horizontal/color/cloudevents-horizontal-color.png)\n\nEvents are everywhere. However, event producers tend to describe events\ndifferently.\n\nThe lack of a common way of describing events means developers must constantly\nre-learn how to consume events. This also limits the potential for libraries,\ntooling and infrastructure to aide the delivery of event data across\nenvironments, like SDKs, event routers or tracing systems. The portability and\nproductivity we can achieve from event data is hindered overall.\n\nCloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in common formats to\nprovide interoperability across services, platforms and systems.\n\nCloudEvents has received a large amount of industry interest, ranging from major\ncloud providers to popular SaaS companies. CloudEvents is hosted by the\n[Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) and was approved as\na Cloud Native sandbox level project on\n[May 15, 2018](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KNSv70fyTfSqUerCnccV7eEC_ynhLsm9A_kjnlmU_t0/edit#slide=id.g37acf52904_1_41).\n\n## CloudEvents Documents\n\nThe following documents are available:\n\n|                               |                                 Latest Release                                 |                                    Working Draft                                    |\n| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n| **Core Specification:**       |\n| CloudEvents                   |         [v1.0](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md)          |          [master](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md)          |\n|                               |\n| **Optional Specifications:**  |\n| AMQP Protocol Binding         | [v1.0](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/amqp-protocol-binding.md) | [master](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/amqp-protocol-binding.md)  |\n| AVRO Event Format             |                                       -
