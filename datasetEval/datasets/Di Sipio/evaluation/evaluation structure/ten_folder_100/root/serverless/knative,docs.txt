In addition to\nreading about how to contribute to the docs, you should take a moment to learn\nabout the Knative code of conduct, governance, values, and the various working\ngroups and committees.\n\n[Knative community and contributor guidelines](https://knative.dev/contributing/)\n\nSource files for all Knative community and governance topics are located\nseparately in the [knative/community](https://github.com/knative/community/)\nrepo.\n\n### Documentation versions for Knative releases\n\nEach release of the Knative docs are available in the website (starting with\n0.3) and their source files are all stored in\n[branches of this repo](./doc-releases.md).\n\n## Help and support\n\nYour help and feedback is always welcome!\n\nIf you find an issue let us know, either by clicking the `Create Issue` on any\nof the website pages, or by directly opening an\n[issue](https://github.com/knative/docs/issues/new/choose) here in the repo.\n\nIf you have a question that you can't find an answer to, we would also like to\nhear about that too. In addition to our docs, you can also reach out to the\ncommunity for assistance. For example, ask a documentation specific question on\nthe `#docs` channel in [Slack](https://knative.slack.com/).\n\nAlso see the [Knative community resource page](https://knative.dev/community/)\nfor a list of all the available community resources, including links to the\nvarious community discussion groups for both development as well as\ntroubleshooting.\n"
