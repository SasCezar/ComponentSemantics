b'# Spotify TUI\n\n![](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blueviolet.svg)\n![](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/Rigellute/spotify-tui?category=code)\n[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/spotify-tui.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/spotify-tui)\n![](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Rigellute/spotify-tui?color=%23c694ff)\n\nA Spotify client for the terminal written in Rust.\n\n![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12150276/64545371-84af3580-d320-11e9-867d-c368fd888b3b.gif)\n\nThe terminal in the demo above is using the [Rigel theme](https://rigel.netlify.com/).\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Connecting to Spotify\xe2\x80\x99s API](#connecting-to-spotifys-api)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Limitations](#limitations)\n- [Using with spotifyd](#using-with-spotifyd)\n- [Development](#development)\n- [Roadmap](#roadmap)\n\n## Installation\n\nThe binary executable is `spt`.\n\n### Homebrew\n\nFor both macOS and Linux\n\n```bash\nbrew install Rigellute/tap/spotify-tui\n```\n\nTo update, run\n\n```bash\nbrew upgrade spotify-tui\n```\n\n### Snap\n\nFor a system with Snap installed, run\n\n```bash\nsnap install spt --channel=edge\n```\n\nThe latest version will be installed for you automatically.\n\n### AUR\n\nFor those on Arch Linux you can find the package on AUR [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/spotify-tui/). If however you\'re using an AUR helper you can install directly from that, for example (in the case of [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay)), run\n\n```bash\nyay -S spotify-tui\n```\n\n### Cargo\n\nUse this option if your architecture is not supported by the pre-built binaries found on the [releases page](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/releases).\n\nFirst, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (using the recommended `rustup` installation method) and then\n\n```bash\ncargo install spotify-tui\n```\n\nThis method will build the binary from source.\n\nTo update, run\n\n```bash\ncargo install spotify-tui --force\n```\n\n#### Note on Linux\n\nFor compilation on Linux the development packages for `libssl` are required.\nFor basic installation instructions, see [install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic).\nIn order to locate dependencies, the compilation also requires `pkg-config` to be installed.\n\n### Manual\n\n1. Download the latest [binary](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/releases) for your OS.\n1. `cd` to the file you just downloaded and unzip\n1. `cd` to `spotify-ui` and run with `./spt`\n\n### Note on Windows\n\nThe core dependancy `termion` [does not yet support Windows](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/termion/issues/103), and so nor does `spotify-tui`. Apologies for this!\n\nYou can, however, run `spotify-tui` within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (which I have tested).\n\n## Connecting to Spotify\xe2\x80\x99s API\n\n`spotify-tui` needs to connect to Spotify\xe2\x80\x99s API in order to find music by\nname, play tracks etc.\n\nInstructions on how to set this up will be shown when you first run the app.\n\nBut here they are again:\n\n1. Go to the [Spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)\n1. Click `Create a Client ID` and create an app\n1. Now click `Edit Settings`\n1. Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` to the Redirect URIs\n1. You are now ready to authenticate with Spotify!\n1. Go back to the terminal\n1. Run `spt`\n1. Enter your `Client ID`\n1. Enter your `Client Secret`\n1. You will be redirected to an official Spotify webpage to ask you for permissions.\n1. After accepting the permissions, you\'ll be redirected to localhost. If all goes well, the redirect URL will be parsed automatically and now you\'re done. If the local webserver fails for some reason you\'ll be redirected to a blank webpage that might say something like "Connection Refused" since no server is running. Regardless, copy the URL and paste into the prompt in the terminal.\n\nAnd now you are ready to use the `spotify-tui` \xf0\x9f\x8e\x89\n\nYou can edit the config at anytime at `${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/client.yml`.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe binary is named `spt`.\n\nWhen running `spotify-tui` press `?` to bring up a help menu that shows currently implemented key events and their actions.\n\n# Configuration\n\nA configuration file is located at `${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/config.yml`\n(not to be confused with client.yml which handles spotify authentication)\n\nThe following is a sample config.yml file:\n\n```yaml\n# Sample config file\n\nkeybindings:\n  # Key stroke can be used if it only uses two keys:\n  # ctrl-q works,\n  # ctrl-alt-q doesn\'t.\n  back: "ctrl-q"\n\n  jump_to_album: "a"\n\n  # Shift modifiers use a capital letter (also applies with other modifier keys\n  # like ctrl-A)\n  jump_to_artist_album: "A"\n\n  manage_devices: "d"\n  decrease_volume: "-"\n  increase_volume: "+"\n  toggle_playback: " "\n  seek_backwards: "<"\n  seek_forwards: ">"\n  next_track: "n"\n  previous_track: "p"\n  copy_song_url: "c"\n  help: "?"\n  shuffle: "s"\n  repeat: "r"\n  search: "/"\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis app uses the [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) from Spotify, which doesn\'t handle streaming itself. So you\'ll need either an official Spotify client open or a lighter weight alternative such as [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd).\n\nIf you want to play tracks, Spotify requires that you have a Premium account.\n\n## Using with [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)\n\nFollow the spotifyd documentation to get set up.\n\nAfter that there is not much to it.\n\n1. Start running the spotifyd daemon.\n1. Start up `spt`\n1. Press `d` to go to the device selection menu and the spotifyd "device" should be there - if not check [these docs](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd#logging)\n\n## Libraries used\n\n- [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)\n- [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify)\n\n## Development\n\n1. [Install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic)\n1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\n1. [Install `xorg-dev`](https://github.com/aweinstock314/rust-clipboard#prerequisites) (required for clipboard support)\n1. Clone or fork this repo and `cd` to it\n1. And then `cargo run`\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe goal is to eventually implement almost every Spotify feature.\n\n### High level requirements yet to be implemented\n\n- Add songs to a playlist\n- Be able to scroll through result pages in every view\n- View Library "Made for you"\n\nThis table shows all that is possible with the Spotify API, what is implemented already, and whether that is essential.\n\n| API method                                        | Implemented yet? | Explanation                                                                                                                                                  | Essential? |\n| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |\n| track                                             | No               | returns a single track given the track\'s ID, URI or URL                                                                                                      | No         |\n| tracks                                            | No               | returns a list of tracks given a list of track IDs, URIs, or URLs                                                                                            | No         |\n| artist                                            | No               | returns a single artist given the artist\'s ID, URI or URL                                                                                                    | Yes        |\n| artists                                           | No               | returns a list of artists given the artist IDs, URIs, or URLs                                                                                                | No         | Get Spotify catalog information about an artist\'s albums | Yes |\n| artist_albums                                     | Yes              | Get Spotify catalog information about an artist\'s top 10 tracks by country.                                                                                  | Yes        |\n| artist_top_tracks                                 | No               | Get Spotify catalog information about artists similar to an                                                                                                  | Yes        |\n| artist_related_artists                            | No               | Get Spotify catalog information about artists similar to an identified artist.
