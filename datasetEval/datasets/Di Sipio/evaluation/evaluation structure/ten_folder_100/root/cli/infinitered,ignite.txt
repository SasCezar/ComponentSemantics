You can check your version of node by running\n\n```sh\n$ node -v\n```\n\nthen...\n\nInstall [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for your system.\n\nfinally...\n\n```sh\n$ yarn global add ignite-cli\n$ ignite new MyNewAppName\n```\n\n## Quick Example\n\nInfinite Red provides two primary boilerplates; they are:\n\n- **Andross** - the tried and true (React Navigation, Redux, & Redux Saga)\n- **Bowser** - the latest and greatest (React Navigation, MobX State Tree, & TypeScript). [Why MST over redux?](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser#why-this-stack)\n\n### Use Ignite Bowser: [Infinite Red Bowser boilerplate](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser)\n\nWatch Jamon Holmgren\'s talk at React Live Amsterdam where he uses Ignite Bowser to build an app in less than 30 minutes:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb8MWkQ9GOc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb8MWkQ9GOc)\n\n```sh\n$ yarn global add ignite-cli\n$ ignite new PizzaApp\n  ( Choose `Bowser` when prompted )\n$ cd PizzaApp\n$ ignite generate screen pizza-location-list\n  ( Choose `example` domain when prompted. This determines where your new screen will go in the directory structure. )\n$ ignite generate component pizza-location\n  ( Choose `example` domain when prompted. This determines where your new screen will go in the directory structure. )\n$ ignite --help\n```\n\n### Use Ignite Andross [Infinite Red Andross boilerplate](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-andross)\n\n```sh\n$ yarn global add ignite-cli\n$ ignite new PizzaApp\n  ( Choose Andross when prompted )\n$ cd PizzaApp\n$ ignite add maps\n$ ignite add vector-icons\n$ ignite generate screen PizzaLocationList\n$ ignite generate component PizzaLocation\n$ ignite generate map StoreLocator\n$ ignite add i18n\n$ ignite remove i18n\n$ ignite --help\n```\n\n## :clipboard: Documentation :clipboard:\n\n- Want to dive into the Ignite CLI documentation?
