b'# create-react-library\n\n> CLI for creating reusable, modern React libraries using Rollup and create-react-app.\n\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/create-react-library.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)\n\n\n## Intro\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="600" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library/master/media/demo.svg">\n</p>\n\n\n## Features\n\n- Easy-to-use CLI\n- Handles all modern JS features\n- Bundles `cjs` and `es` module formats\n- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for example usage and local dev\n- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for bundling\n- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpiling\n- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for testing\n- Supports complicated peer-dependencies\n- Supports CSS modules\n- Optional support for TypeScript\n- Sourcemap creation\n- Hundreds of public modules created\n- Thorough documentation :heart_eyes:\n- [Chinese docs](./readme.zh-CN.md) by [@monsterooo](https://github.com/monsterooo)\n\n\n## Notice\n\nThis is now an [OPEN Open Source](http://openopensource.org/) project. I am not able to invest a significant amount of time into maintaining CRL and so am looking for volunteers who would like to be active maintainers of the project. If you are interested, shoot me a note.\n\n\n## Install globally\n\nThis package requires `node >= 4`, but we recommend `node >= 8`.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g create-react-library\n```\n\n## Usage with npx\n\n```bash\nnpx create-react-library\n```\n\n_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_\n\n## Creating a New Module\n\n```bash\ncreate-react-library\n```\n\nAnswer some basic prompts about your module, and then the CLI will perform the following steps:\n- copy over the template\n- install dependencies via yarn or npm\n- link packages together for local development\n- initialize local git repo\n\nAt this point, your new module should resemble this screenshot and is all setup for local development.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="600" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library/master/media/tree.svg">\n</p>\n\n\n## Development\n\nLocal development is broken into two parts (ideally using two tabs).\n\nFirst, run rollup to watch your `src/` module and automatically recompile it into `dist/` whenever you make changes.\n\n```bash\nnpm start # runs rollup with watch flag\n```\n\nThe second part will be running the `example/` create-react-app that\'s linked to the local version of your module.\n\n```bash\n# (in another tab)\ncd example\nnpm start # runs create-react-app dev server\n```\n\nNow, anytime you make a change to your library in `src/` or to the example app\'s `example/src`, `create-react-app` will live-reload your local dev server so you can iterate on your component in real-time.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/12NUbkX6p4xOO4/giphy.gif)\n\n\n#### Publishing to npm\n\n```bash\nnpm publish\n```\n\nThis builds `cjs` and `es` versions of your module to `dist/` and then publishes your module to `npm`.\n\nMake sure that any npm modules you want as peer dependencies are properly marked as `peerDependencies` in `package.json`. The rollup config will automatically recognize them as peers and not try to bundle them in your module.\n\n\n#### Deploying to Github Pages\n\n```bash\nnpm run deploy\n```\n\nThis creates a production build of the example `create-react-app` that showcases your library and then runs `gh-pages` to deploy the resulting bundle.\n\n## Use with React Hooks\n\nIf you use [react-hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) in your project, when you debug you example you may run into a exception [Invalid Hook Call Warning](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html). This [issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14257) explain the reason, your lib and example use different instance, one solution is rewrite the `react` path in your example `package.json` to \'file:../node_modules/react\' or \'link:../node_modules/react\'.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Multiple Named Exports\n\nHere is a [branch](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-modern-library-boilerplate/tree/feature/multiple-exports) which demonstrates how to use multiple named exports. The module in this branch exports two components, `Foo` and `Bar`, and shows how to use them from the example app.\n\n### Material-UI\n\nHere is a [branch](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-modern-library-boilerplate/tree/feature/material-ui) which demonstrates how to make use of a relatively complicated peer dependency, [material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui). It shows the power of [rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external) which makes it a breeze to create reusable modules that include complicated material-ui subcomponents without having them bundled as a part of your module.\n\n### Boilerplate\n\nThe CLI is based on this [boilerplate](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-modern-library-boilerplate), which you can optionally read about [here](https://hackernoon.com/publishing-baller-react-modules-2b039d84bce7).\n\n### Libraries\n\nHere are some example libraries that have been bootstrapped with `create-react-library`.\n\n- [tabler-react](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-react) - React components and demo for the Tabler UI theme.\n- [react-background-slideshow](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-background-slideshow) - Sexy tiled background slideshow for React \xf0\x9f\x94\xa5\n- [react-starfield-animation](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-starfield-animation) -Canvas-based starfield animation for React \xe2\x9c\xa8\n- [react-particle-effect-button](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-particle-effect-button) - Bursting particle effect buttons for React \xf0\x9f\x8e\x89\n- [react-particle-animation](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-particle-animation) - Canvas-based particle animation for React \xf0\x9f\x8c\x90\n- [react-block-image](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-block-image) - React replacement for img with more control + fallback support \xf0\x9f\x8c\x83\n- [react-mp3-recorder](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-mp3-recorder) - Microphone recorder for React that captures mp3 audio \xf0\x9f\x8e\xb5\n- [react-before-after-slider](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-before-after-slider) - A sexy image comparison slider for React.\n- [worldwind-react-globe](https://github.com/emxsys/worldwind-react-globe) - NASA WorldWind globe component for React.\n- [react-shimmer](https://github.com/gokcan/react-shimmer) - Shimmer effect for loading images.\n- [react-login-modal-sm](https://github.com/Silind/react-login-modal-sm) - Customizable React social media login modal.\n- [react-gradient-scroll-indicator](https://github.com/jbccollins/react-gradient-scroll-indicator) - Wrapper for scrollable content with gradients.\n- [react-editext](https://github.com/alioguzhan/react-editext) - Editable Text Component.\n- ... and hundreds more!\n\nWant to see a more completed list?
