Wails offers a different approach: it provides the ability to wrap both Go code and a web frontend into a single binary. Tools are provided to make this easy for you by handling project creation, compilation and bundling. All you have to do is get creative!\n\n## Features\n\n- Use standard Go libraries/frameworks for the backend\n- Use any frontend technology to build your UI\n- Quickly create Vue, Vuetify or React frontends for your Go programs\n- Expose Go methods/functions to the frontend via a single bind command\n- Uses native rendering engines - no embedded browser\n- Shared events system\n- Native file dialogs\n- Powerful cli tool\n- Multiplatform\n\n## Project Status\n\nWails is currently in Beta. Please make sure you read the [Project Status](https://wails.app/project_status.html) if you are interested in using this project.\n\n## Installation\n\nWails uses cgo to bind to the native rendering engines so a number of platform dependent libraries are needed as well as an installation of Go. The basic requirements are:\n\n- Go 1.12\n- npm\n\n### MacOS\n\nMake sure you have the xcode command line tools installed. This can be done by running:\n\n`xcode-select --install`\n\n### Linux\n\n#### Debian/Ubuntu\n\n`sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev`\n\n_Debian: 8, 9, 10_\n\n_Ubuntu: 16.04, 18.04, 19.04_\n\n_Also succesfully tested on: Zorin 15, Parrot 4.7, Linuxmint 19, Elementary 5, Kali, Neon_\n\n#### Arch Linux\n\n`sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk gtk3`\n\n_Also succesfully test on: Manjaro & ArcoLinux_\n\n#### Centos\n\n`sudo yum install webkitgtk3-devel gtk3-devel`\n\n_CentOS 6, 7_\n\n#### Fedora\n\n`sudo yum install webkit2gtk3-devel gtk3-devel`\n\n_Fedora 29, 30_\n\n#### VoidLinux & VoidLinux-musl\n\n`xbps-install gtk+3-devel webkit2gtk-devel`\n\n#### Gentoo\n\n`sudo emerge gtk+:3 webkit-gtk`\n\n### Windows\n\nWindows requires gcc and related tooling. The recommended download is from [http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download). Once this is installed, you are good to go.\n\n## Installation\n\n**Ensure Go modules are enabled: GO111MODULE=on and go/bin is in your PATH variable.**\n\nInstallation is as simple as running the following command:\n\n<pre style=\'color:white\'>\ngo get github.com/wailsapp/wails/cmd/wails\n</pre>\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIt is recommended at this stage to read the comprehensive documentation at [https://wails.app](https://wails.app).\n\n## FAQ\n\n * Is this an alternative to Electron?\n\n   Depends on your requirements. It\'s designed to make it easy for Go programmers to make lightweight desktop applications or add a frontend to their existing applications. Whilst Wails does not currently offer hooks into native elements such as menus, this may change in the future.\n\n * Who is this project aimed at?\n\n   Go programmers who want to bundle an HTML/JS/CSS frontend with their applications, without resorting to creating a server and opening a browser to view it.\n\n * What\'s with the name?\n\n   When I saw WebView, I thought "What I really want is tooling around building a WebView app, a bit like Rails is to Ruby". So initially it was a play on words (Webview on Rails). It just so happened to also be a homophone of the English name for the [Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) I am from. So it stuck.\n\n## Shoulders of Giants\n\nWithout the following people, this project would never have existed:\n\n  * [Dustin Krysak](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/bashfulrobot) - His support and feedback has been immense. More patience than you can throw a stick at (Not long now Dustin!).\n  * [Serge Zaitsev](https://github.com/zserge) - Creator of [Webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview) which Wails uses for the windowing.\n\nAnd without [these people](CONTRIBUTORS.md), it wouldn\'t be what it is today. A huge thank you to each and every one of you!\n\nSpecial Mentions:\n\n  * [Bill Kennedy](https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet) - Go guru, encourager and all-round nice guy, whose infectious energy and inspiration powered me on when I had none left.\n  * [Mark Bates](https://github.com/markbates) - Creator of [Packr](https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr), inspiration for packing strategies which fed into some of the tooling.\n\nThis project was mainly coded to the following albums:\n\n  * [Manic Street Preachers - Resistance Is Futile](https://open.spotify.com/album/1R2rsEUqXjIvAbzM0yHrxA)\n  * [Manic Street Preachers - This Is My Truth, Tell Me Yours](https://open.spotify.com/album/4VzCL9kjhgGQeKCiojK1YN)\n  * [The Midnight - Endless Summer](https://open.spotify.com/album/4Krg8zvprquh7TVn9OxZn8)\n  * [Gary Newman - Savage (Songs from a Broken World)](https://open.spotify.com/album/3kMfsD07Q32HRWKRrpcexr)\n  * [Steve Vai - Passion & Warfare](https://open.spotify.com/album/0oL0OhrE2rYVns4IGj8h2m)\n  * [Ben Howard - Every Kingdom](https://open.spotify.com/album/1nJsbWm3Yy2DW1KIc1OKle)\n  * [Ben Howard - Noonday Dream](https://open.spotify.com/album/6astw05cTiXEc2OvyByaPs)\n  * [Adwaith - Melyn](https://open.spotify.com/album/2vBE40Rp60tl7rNqIZjaXM)\n  * [Gwidaith Hen Fran - Cedors Hen Wrach](https://open.spotify.com/album/3v2hrfNGINPLuDP0YDTOjm)\n  * [Metallica - Metallica](https://open.spotify.com/album/2Kh43m04B1UkVcpcRa1Zug)\n  * [Bloc Party - Silent Alarm](https://open.spotify.com/album/6SsIdN05HQg2GwYLfXuzLB)\n  * [Maxthor - Another World](https://open.spotify.com/album/3tklE2Fgw1hCIUstIwPBJF)\n  * [Alun Tan Lan - Y Distawrwydd](https://open.spotify.com/album/0c32OywcLpdJCWWMC6vB8v)\n\n## Licensing\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwailsapp%2Fwails.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwailsapp%2Fwails?ref=badge_large)\n'
