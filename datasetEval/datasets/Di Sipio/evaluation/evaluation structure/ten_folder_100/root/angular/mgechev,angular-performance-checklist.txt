"Angular Performance Checklist" covers different topics - from server-side pre-rendering and bundling of our applications to runtime performance and optimization of the change detection performed by the framework.\n\nThe document is divided into two main sections:\n\n- Network performance - lists practices that are going to improve mostly the load time of our application. They include methods for latency and bandwidth reduction.\n- Runtime performance - practices that improve the runtime performance of our application. They include mostly change detection and rendering related optimizations.\n\nSome practices impact both categories so there could be a slight intersection, however, the differences in the use cases and the implications will be explicitly mentioned.\n\nMost subsections list tools, related to the specific practice, that can make us more efficient by automating our development flow.\n\nNote that most practices are valid for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. Practices which make an exception will be mentioned by specifying to which version of the protocol they could be applied.\n\n## Table of Content\n\n- [Angular Performance Checklist](#angular-2-performance-checklist)\n  - [Introduction](#introduction)\n  - [Table of Content](#table-of-content)\n  - [Network performance](#network-performance)\n    - [Bundling](#bundling)\n    - [Minification and Dead code elimination](#minification-and-dead-code-elimination)\n    - [Remove template whitespace](#remove-template-whitespace)\n    - [Tree-shaking](#tree-shaking)\n    - [Tree-shakeable providers](#tree-shakeable-providers)\n    - [Ahead-of-Time (AoT) Compilation](#ahead-of-time-aot-compilation)\n    - [Compression](#compression)\n    - [Pre-fetching Resources](#pre-fetching-resources)\n    - [Lazy-Loading of Resources](#lazy-loading-of-resources)\n    - [Don\'t lazy-load default route](#dont-lazy-load-the-default-route)\n    - [Caching](#caching)\n    - [Use Application Shell](#use-application-shell)\n    - [Use Service Workers](#use-service-workers)\n  - [Runtime Optimizations](#runtime-optimizations)\n    - [Use `enableProdMode`](#use-enableprodmode)\n    - [Ahead-of-Time Compilation](#ahead-of-time-compilation)\n    - [Web Workers](#web-workers)\n    - [Server-Side Rendering](#server-side-rendering)\n    - [Change Detection](#change-detection)\n      - [`ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`](#changedetectionstrategyonpush)\n      - [Detaching the Change Detector](#detaching-the-change-detector)\n      - [Run outside Angular](#run-outside-angular)\n    - [Use pure pipes](#use-pure-pipes)\n    - [`*ngFor` directive](#ngfor-directive)\n      - [Use `trackBy` option](#use-trackby-option)\n      - [Minimize DOM elements](#minimize-dom-elements)\n    - [Optimize template expressions](#optimize-template-expressions)\n- [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n## Network performance\n\nSome of the tools in this section are still in development and are subject to change. The Angular core team is working on automating the build process for our applications as much as possible so a lot of things will happen transparently.\n\n### Bundling\n\nBundling is a standard practice aiming to reduce the number of requests that the browser needs to perform in order to deliver the application requested by the user. In essence, the bundler receives as an input a list of entry points and produces one or more bundles. This way, the browser can get the entire application by performing only a few requests, instead of requesting each individual resource separately.\n\nAs your application grows bundling everything into a single large bundle would again be counterproductive. Explore Code Splitting techniques using Webpack.\n\n**Additional http requests will not be a concern with HTTP/2 because of the [server push](https://http2.github.io/faq/#whats-the-benefit-of-server-push) feature.**\n\n**Tooling**\n\nTools which allows us to bundle our applications efficiently are:\n\n- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - provides efficient bundling by performing [tree-shaking](#tree-shaking).\n- [Webpack Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/) - Techniques to split your code.\n- [Webpack & http2](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-http-2-7083ec3f3ce6#.46idrz8kb) - Need for splitting with http2.\n- [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) - provides bundling by performing efficient tree-shaking, taking advantage of the static nature of the ES2015 modules.\n- [Google Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler) - performs plenty of optimizations and provides bundling support. Originally written in Java, since recently it also has a [JavaScript version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-closure-compiler) that can be [found here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-closure-compiler).\n- [SystemJS Builder](https://github.com/systemjs/builder) - provides a single-file build for SystemJS of mixed-dependency module trees.\n- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).\n- [ngx-build-modern](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus/tree/master/ngx-build-modern) - plugin for Angular-CLI which builds the application bundle in two variants:\n  1. For modern browsers with ES2015 modules and specific polyfills resulting in a smaller bundle.\n  2. Additional legacy version using different polyfills and compiler target (as it is by default).\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ["Building an Angular Application for Production"](http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/06/26/tree-shaking-angular2-production-build-rollup-javascript/)\n- ["2.5X Smaller Angular Applications with Google Closure Compiler"](http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/07/21/even-smaller-angular2-applications-closure-tree-shaking/)\n\n### Minification and dead code elimination\n\nThese practices allow us to minimize the bandwidth consumption by reducing the payload of our application.\n\n**Tooling**\n\n- [Uglify](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) - performs minification such as mangling variables, removal of comments & whitespace, dead code elimination, etc. Written completely in JavaScript, has plugins for all popular task runners.\n- [Google Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler) - performs similar to uglify type of minification. In advanced mode, it transforms the AST of our program aggressively in order to be able to perform even more sophisticated optimizations. It has also a [JavaScript version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-closure-compiler) that can be [found here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-closure-compiler). GCC also supports *most of the ES2015 modules syntax* so it can [perform tree-shaking](#tree-shaking).\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ["Building an Angular Application for Production"](http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/06/26/tree-shaking-angular2-production-build-rollup-javascript/)\n- ["2.5X Smaller Angular Applications with Google Closure Compiler"](http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/07/21/even-smaller-angular2-applications-closure-tree-shaking/)\n\n### Remove template whitespace\n\nAlthough we don\'t see the whitespace character (a character matching the `\\s` regex) it is still represented by bytes which are transferred over the network. If we reduce the whitespace from our templates to the minimum we will be respectively able to drop the bundle size of the AoT code even further.\n\nThankfully, we don\'t have to do this manually. The `ComponentMetadata` interface provides the property `preserveWhitespaces` which by default has value `false` meaning that by default the Angular compiler will trim whitespaces to further reduce the size of our application. In case we set the property to `true` Angular will preserve the whitespace.\n\n- [preserveWhitespaces in the Angular docs](https://angular.io/api/core/Component#preserveWhitespaces)\n\n### Tree-shaking\n\nFor the final version of our applications, we usually don\'t use the entire code which is provided by Angular and/or any third-party library, even the one that we\'ve written. Thanks to the static nature of the ES2015 modules, we\'re able to get rid of the code which is not referenced in our apps.\n\n**Example**\n\n```javascript\n// foo.js\nexport foo = () => \'foo\';\nexport bar = () => \'bar\';\n\n// app.js\nimport { foo } from \'./foo\';\nconsole.log(foo());\n```\nOnce we tree-shake and bundle `app.js` we\'ll get:\n\n```javascript\nlet foo = () => \'foo\';\nconsole.log(foo());\n```\n\nThis means that the unused export `bar` will not be included into the final bundle.\n\n**Tooling**\n\n- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - provides efficient bundling by performing [tree-shaking](#tree-shaking). Once the application has been bundled, it does not export the unused code so it can be safely considered as dead code and removed by Uglify.\n- [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) - provides bundling by performing an efficient tree-shaking, taking advantage of the static nature of the ES2015 modules.\n- [Google Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler) - performs plenty of optimizations and provides bundling support. Originally written in Java, since recently it has also a [JavaScript version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-closure-compiler) that can be [found here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-closure-compiler).\n\n*Note:* GCC does not support `export *` yet, which is essential for building Angular applications because of the heavy usage of the "barrel" pattern.\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ["Building an Angular Application for Production"](http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/06/26/tree-shaking-angular2-production-build-rollup-javascript/)\n- ["2.5X Smaller Angular Applications with Google Closure Compiler"](http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/07/21/even-smaller-angular2-applications-closure-tree-shaking/)\n- ["Using pipeable operators in RxJS"](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/pipeable-operators.md)\n\n### Tree-Shakeable Providers\n\nSince the release of Angular version 6, The angular team provided a new feature to allow services to be tree-shakeable, meaning that your services will not be included in the final bundle unless they\'re being used by other services or components. This can help reduce the bundle size by removing unused code from the bundle.\n\nYou can make your services tree-shakeable by using the `providedIn` attribute to define where the service should be initialized when using the `@Injectable()` decorator. Then you should remove it from the `providers` attribute of your `NgModule` declaration as well as its import statement as follows.\n\nBefore:\n\n```ts\n// app.module.ts\nimport { NgModule } from \'@angular/core\'\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from \'./app-routing.module\'\nimport { AppComponent } from \'./app.component\'\nimport { environment } from \'../environments/environment\'\nimport { MyService } from \'./app.service\'\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    ...\n  ],\n  providers: [MyService],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\n```ts\n// my-service.service.ts\nimport { Injectable } from \'@angular/core\'\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class MyService { }\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```ts\n// app.module.ts\nimport { NgModule } from \'@angular/core\'\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from \'./app-routing.module\'\nimport { AppComponent } from \'./app.component\'\nimport { environment } from \'../environments/environment\'\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    ...\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\n```ts\n// my-service.service.ts\nimport { Injectable } from \'@angular/core\'\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: \'root\'\n})\nexport class MyService { }\n```\n\nIf `MyService` is not injected in any component/service, then it will not be included in the bundle.\n\n**Resources**\n\n- [Angular Providers](https://angular.io/guide/providers)\n\n### Ahead-of-Time (AoT) Compilation\n\nA challenge for the available in the wild tools (such as GCC, Rollup, etc.) are the HTML-like templates of the Angular components, which cannot be analyzed with their capabilities. This makes their tree-shaking support less efficient because they\'re not sure which directives are referenced within the templates. The AoT compiler transpiles the Angular HTML-like templates to JavaScript or TypeScript with ES2015 module imports. This way we are able to efficiently tree-shake during bundling and remove all the unused directives defined by Angular, third-party libraries or by ourselves.\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ["Ahead-of-Time Compilation in Angular"](http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/08/14/ahead-of-time-compilation-angular-offline-precompilation/)\n\n### Compression\n\nCompression of the responses\' payload standard practice for bandwidth usage reduction. By specifying the value of the header `Accept-Encoding`, the browser hints the server which compression algorithms are available on the client\'s machine. On the other hand, the server sets the value for the `Content-Encoding` header of the response in order to tell the browser which algorithm has been chosen for compressing the response.\n\n**Tooling**\n\nThe tooling here is not Angular-specific and entirely depends on the web/application server that we\'re using. Typical compression algorithms are:\n\n- deflate - a data compression algorithm and associated file format that uses a combination of the LZ77 algorithm and Huffman coding.\n- [brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) - a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding, and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression.\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ["Better than Gzip Compression with Brotli"](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/11/better-than-gzip-compression-with-brotli/)\n- ["2.5X Smaller Angular Applications with Google Closure Compiler"](http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/07/21/even-smaller-angular2-applications-closure-tree-shaking/)\n\n### Pre-fetching Resources\n\nResource pre-fetching is a great way to improve user experience. We can either pre-fetch assets (images, styles, modules intended to be [loaded lazily](#lazy-loading-of-resources), etc.) or data. There are different pre-fetching strategies but most of them depend on specifics of the application.\n\n### Lazy-Loading of Resources\n\nIn case the target application has a huge code base with hundreds of dependencies, the practices listed above may not help us reduce the bundle to a reasonable size (reasonable might be 100K or 2M, it again, completely depends on the business goals).\n\nIn such cases, a good solution might be to load some of the application\'s modules lazily. For instance, let\'s suppose we\'re building an e-commerce system. In this case, we might want to load the admin panel independently from the user-facing UI. Once the administrator has to add a new product we\'d want to provide the UI required for that. This could be either only the "Add product page" or the entire admin panel, depending on our use case/business requirements.\n\n**Tooling**\n\n- [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) - allows asynchronous module loading.\n- [ngx-quicklink](https://github.com/mgechev/ngx-quicklink) - router preloading strategy which automatically downloads the lazy-loaded modules associated with all the visible links on the screen\n\n### Don\'t Lazy-Load the Default Route\n\nLet\'s suppose we have the following routing configuration:\n\n```ts\n// Bad practice\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'/dashboard\', pathMatch: \'full\' },\n  { path: \'dashboard\',  loadChildren: () => import(\'./dashboard.module\').then(mod => mod.DashboardModule) },\n  { path: \'heroes\', loadChildren: () => import(\'./heroes.module\').then(mod => mod.HeroesModule) }\n];\n```\n\nThe first time the user opens the application using the url: https://example.com/ they will be redirected to `/dashboard` which will trigger the lazy-route with path `dashboard`. In order Angular to render the bootstrap component of the module, it will has to download the file `dashboard.module` and all of its dependencies. Later, the file needs to be parsed by the JavaScript VM and evaluated.\n\nTriggering extra HTTP requests and performing unnecessary computations during the initial page load is a bad practice since it slows down the initial page rendering. Consider declaring the default page route as non-lazy.\n\n### Caching\n\nCaching is another common practice intending to speed-up our application by taking advantage of the heuristic that if one resource was recently been requested, it might be requested again in the near future.\n\nFor caching data we usually use a custom caching mechanism. For caching static assets, we can either use the standard browser caching or Service Workers with the [CacheStorage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache).\n\n### Use Application Shell\n\nTo make the perceived performance of your application faster, use an [Application Shell](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/11/app-shell).\n\nThe application shell is the minimum user interface that we show to the users in order to indicate them that the application will be delivered soon. For generating an application shell dynamically you can use Angular Universal with custom directives which conditionally show elements depending on the used rendering platform (i.e. hide everything except the App Shell when using `platform-server`).\n\n**Tooling**\n\n- [Angular Service Worker](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-intro) - aims to automate the process of managing Service Workers. It also contains Service Worker for caching static assets and one for [generating application shell](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/11/app-shell?hl=en).\n- [Angular Universal](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/platform-server) - Universal (isomorphic) JavaScript support for Angular.\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ["Instant Loading Web Apps with an Application Shell Architecture"](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/11/app-shell)\n\n### Use Service Workers\n\nWe can think of the Service Worker as an HTTP proxy which is located in the browser. All requests sent from the client are first intercepted by the Service Worker which can either handle them or pass them through the network.\n\nYou can add a Service Worker to your Angular project by running\n``` ng add @angular/pwa ```\n\n**Tooling**\n\n- [Angular Service Worker](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-intro) - aims to automate the process of managing Service Workers. It also contains Service Worker for caching static assets and one for [generating application shell](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/11/app-shell?hl=en).\n- [Offline Plugin for Webpack](https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin) - Webpack plugin that adds support for Service Worker with a fall-back to AppCache.\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ["The offline cookbook"](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/)\n- ["Getting started with service workers"](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-getting-started)\n\n## Runtime Optimizations\n\nThis section includes practices that can be applied in order to provide smoother user experience with 60 frames per second (fps).\n\n### Use `enableProdMode`\n\nIn development mode, Angular performs some extra checks in order to verify that performing change detection does not result in any additional changes to any of the bindings. This way the frameworks assures that the unidirectional data flow has been followed.\n\nIn order to disable these changes for production do not forget to invoke `enableProdMode`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { enableProdMode } from \'@angular/core\';\n\nif (ENV === \'production\') {\n  enableProdMode();\n}\n```\n\n### Ahead-of-Time Compilation\n\nAoT can be helpful not only for achieving more efficient bundling by performing tree-shaking, but also for improving the runtime performance of our applications. The alternative of AoT is Just-in-Time compilation (JiT) which is performed runtime, therefore we can reduce the amount of computations required for the rendering of our application by performing the compilation as part of our build process.\n\n**Tooling**\n\n- [angular2-seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed) - a starter project which includes support for AoT compilation.\n- [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io) Using the `ng serve --prod`\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ["Ahead-of-Time Compilation in Angular"](http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/08/14/ahead-of-time-compilation-angular-offline-precompilation/)\n\n### Web Workers\n\nThe usual problem in the typical single-page application (SPA) is that our code is usually run in a single thread. This means that if we want to achieve smooth user experience with 60fps we have **at most 16ms** for execution between the individual frames are being rendered, otherwise, they\'ll drop by half.\n\nIn complex applications with a huge component tree, where the change detection needs to perform millions of checks each second it will not be hard to start dropping frames. Thanks to the Angular\'s agnosticism and being decoupled from DOM architecture, it\'s possible to run our entire application (including change detection) in a Web Worker and leave the main UI thread responsible only for rendering.\n\n**Tooling**\n\n- The module which allows us to run our application in a Web Worker is supported by the core team. Examples of how it can be used can be [found here](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/modules/playground/src/web_workers).\n- [Webpack Web Worker Loader](https://github.com/webpack/worker-loader) - A Web Worker Loader for webpack.\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ["Using Web Workers for more responsive apps"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz_zKXiNGSE)\n\n### Server-Side Rendering\n\nA big issue of the traditional SPA is that they cannot be rendered until the entire JavaScript required for their initial rendering is available. This leads to two big problems:\n\n- Not all search engines are running the JavaScript associated with the page so they are not able to index the content of dynamic apps properly.\n- Poor user experience, since the user will see nothing more than a blank/loading screen until the JavaScript associated with the page is downloaded, parsed and executed.\n\nServer-side rendering solves this issue by pre-rendering the requested page on the server and providing the markup of the rendered page during the initial page load.\n\n**Tooling**\n\n- [Angular Universal](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/platform-server) - Universal (isomorphic) JavaScript support for Angular.\n- [Preboot](https://github.com/angular/preboot) - Library to help manage the transition of state (i.e. events, focus, data) from a server-generated web view to a client-generated web view.\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ["Angular Server Rendering"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wvZ7gakqV4)\n- ["Angular Universal Patterns"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCj_oC3m6_U)\n\n### Change Detection\n\nOn each asynchronous event, Angular performs change detection over the entire component tree. Although the code which detects for changes is optimized for [inline-caching](http://mrale.ph/blog/2012/06/03/explaining-js-vms-in-js-inline-caches.html), this still can be a heavy computation in complex applications. A way to improve the performance of the change detection is to not perform it for subtrees which are not supposed to be changed based on the recent actions.\n\n#### `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`\n\nThe `OnPush` change detection strategy allows us to disable the change detection mechanism for subtrees of the component tree. By setting the change detection strategy to any component to the value `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` will make the change detection perform **only** when the component has received different inputs. Angular will consider inputs as different when it compares them with the previous inputs by reference, and the result of the reference check is `false`. In combination with [immutable data structures](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), `OnPush` can bring great performance implications for such "pure" components.\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ["Change Detection in Angular"](https://vsavkin.com/change-detection-in-angular-2-4f216b855d4c)\n- ["Everything you need to know about change detection in Angular"](https://blog.angularindepth.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-change-detection-in-angular-8006c51d206f)\n\n#### Detaching the Change Detector\n\nAnother way of implementing a custom change detection mechanism is by `detach`ing and `reattach`ing the change detector (CD) for given a component. Once we `detach` the CD Angular will not perform check for the entire component subtree.\n\nThis practice is typically used when user actions or interactions with external services trigger the change detection more often than required. In such cases we may want to consider detaching the change detector and reattaching it only when performing change detection is required.\n\n#### Run outside Angular\n\nThe Angular\'s change detection mechanism is being triggered thanks to [zone.js](https://github.com/angular/zone.js). Zone.js monkey patches all asynchronous APIs in the browser and triggers the change detection at the end of the execution of any async callback. In **rare cases**, we may want the given code to be executed outside the context of the Angular Zone and thus, without running change detection mechanism. In such cases, we can use the method `runOutsideAngular` of the `NgZone` instance.\n\n**Example**\n\nIn the snippet below, you can see an example for a component that uses this practice. When the `_incrementPoints` method is called the component will start incrementing the `_points` property every 10ms (by default). The incrementation will make the illusion of an animation. Since in this case, we don\'t want to trigger the change detection mechanism for the entire component tree, every 10ms, we can run `_incrementPoints` outside the context of the Angular\'s zone and update the DOM manually (see the `points` setter).\n\n```ts\n@Component({\n  template: \'<span #label></span>\'\n})\nclass PointAnimationComponent {\n\n  @Input() duration = 1000;\n  @Input() stepDuration = 10;\n  @ViewChild(\'label\') label: ElementRef;\n\n  @Input() set points(val: number) {\n    this._points = val;\n    if (this.label) {\n      this.label.nativeElement.innerText = this._pipe.transform(this.points, \'1.0-0\');\n    }\n  }\n  get points() {\n    return this._points;\n  }\n\n  private _incrementInterval: any;\n  private _points: number = 0;\n\n  constructor(private _zone: NgZone, private _pipe: DecimalPipe) {}\n\n  ngOnChanges(changes: any) {\n    const change = changes.points;\n    if (!change) {\n      return;\n    }\n    if (typeof change.previousValue !== \'number\') {\n      this.points = change.currentValue;\n    } else {\n      this.points = change.previousValue;\n      this._ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {\n        this._incrementPoints(change.currentValue);\n      });\n    }\n  }\n\n  private _incrementPoints(newVal: number) {\n    const diff = newVal - this.points;\n    const step = this.stepDuration * (diff / this.duration);\n    const initialPoints = this.points;\n    this._incrementInterval = setInterval(() => {\n      let nextPoints = Math.ceil(initialPoints + diff);\n      if (this.points >= nextPoints) {\n        this.points = initialPoints + diff;\n        clearInterval(this._incrementInterval);\n      } else {\n        this.points += step;\n      }\n    }, this.stepDuration);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Warning**: Use this practice **very carefully only when you\'re sure what you are doing** because if not used properly it can lead to an inconsistent state of the DOM. Also, note that the code above is not going to run in WebWorkers. In order to make it WebWorker-compatible, you need to set the label\'s value by using the Angular\'s renderer.\n\n### Use pure pipes\n\nAs argument the `@Pipe` decorator accepts an object literal with the following format:\n\n```typescript\ninterface PipeMetadata {\n  name: string;\n  pure: boolean;\n}\n```\n\nThe pure flag indicates that the pipe is not dependent on any global state and does not produce side-effects. This means that the pipe will return the same output when invoked with the same input. This way Angular can cache the outputs for all the input parameters the pipe has been invoked with, and reuse them in order to not have to recompute them on each evaluation.\n\nThe default value of the `pure` property is `true`.\n\n### `*ngFor` directive\n\nThe `*ngFor` directive is used for rendering a collection.\n\n#### Use `trackBy` option\n\nBy default `*ngFor` identifies object uniqueness by reference.\n\nWhich means when a developer breaks reference to object during updating item\'s content Angular treats it as removal of the old object and addition of the new object. This effects in destroying old DOM node in the list and adding new DOM node on its place.\n\nThe developer can provide a hint for angular how to identify object uniqueness: custom tracking function as the `trackBy` option for the `*ngFor` directive. The tracking function takes two arguments: `index` and `item`. Angular uses the value returned from the tracking function to track items identity. It is very common to use the ID of the particular record as the unique key.\n\n**Example**\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\n  selector: \'yt-feed\',\n  template: `\n  <h1>Your video feed</h1>\n  <yt-player *ngFor="let video of feed; trackBy: trackById" [video]="video"></yt-player>\n`\n})\nexport class YtFeedComponent {\n  feed = [\n    {\n      id: 3849, // note "id" field, we refer to it in "trackById" function\n      title: "Angular in 60 minutes",\n      url: "http://youtube.com/ng2-in-60-min",\n      likes: "29345"\n    },\n    // ...\n  ];\n\n  trackById(index, item) {\n    return item.id;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Minimize DOM elements\n\nRendering the DOM elements is usually the most expensive operation when adding elements to the UI. The main work is usually caused by inserting the element into the DOM and applying the styles. If `*ngFor` renders a lot of elements, browsers (especially older ones) may slow down and need more time to finish rendering of all elements. This is not specific to Angular.\n\nTo reduce rendering time, try the following:\n- Apply virtual scrolling via [CDK](https://material.angular.io/cdk/scrolling/overview) or [ngx-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/rintoj/ngx-virtual-scroller)\n- Reducing the amount of DOM elements rendered in `*ngFor` section of your template. Usually, unneeded/unused DOM elements arise from extending the template again and again. Rethinking its structure probably makes things much easier.\n- Use [`ng-container`](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives#ngcontainer) where possible\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ["NgFor directive"](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html) - official documentation for `*ngFor`\n- ["Angular\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aImprove performance with trackBy"](https://netbasal.com/angular-2-improve-performance-with-trackby-cc147b5104e5) - shows gif demonstration of the approach\n- [Component Dev Kit (CDK) Virtual Scrolling](https://material.angular.io/cdk/scrolling/overview) - API description\n- [ngx-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/rintoj/ngx-virtual-scroller) - displays a virtual, "infinite" list\n\n### Optimize template expressions\n\nAngular executes template expressions after every change detection cycle. Change detection cycles are triggered by many asynchronous activities such as promise resolutions, http results, timer events, keypresses, and mouse moves.\n\nExpressions should finish quickly or the user experience may drag, especially on slower devices. Consider caching values when their computation is expensive.\n\n**Resources**\n- [quick-execution](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#quick-execution) - official documentation for template expressions\n- [Increasing Performance - more than a pipe dream](https://youtu.be/I6ZvpdRM1eQ) - ng-conf video on youtube.
