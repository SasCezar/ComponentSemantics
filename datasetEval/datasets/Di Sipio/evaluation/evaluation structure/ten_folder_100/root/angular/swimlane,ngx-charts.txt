It is using Angular to render and animate the SVG elements with all of its binding and speed goodness, and uses d3 for the excellent math functions, scales, axis and shape generators, etc. By having Angular do all of the rendering it opens us up to endless possibilities the Angular platform provides such as AoT, Universal, etc.\n\nData visualization is a science but that doesn't mean it has to be ugly. One of the big efforts we've made while creating this project is to make the charts aesthetically pleasing. The styles are also completely customizable through CSS, so you can override them as you please.\n\nAlso, constructing custom charts is possible by leveraging the various ngx-charts components that are exposed through the ngx-charts module.\n\nFor more info, check out the [documentation](https://swimlane.gitbook.io/ngx-charts) and the [demos](https://swimlane.github.io/ngx-charts/).\n\n## Features\n\n### Chart Types\n\n- Horizontal & Vertical Bar Charts (Standard, Grouped, Stacked, Normalized)\n- Line\n- Area (Standard, Stacked, Normalized)\n- Pie (Explodable, Grid, Custom legends)\n- Bubble\n- Donut\n- Gauge (Linear & Radial)\n- Force Directed Graph (deprecated, please use [ngx-graph](https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-graph) instead)\n- Heatmap\n- Treemap\n- Number Cards\n\n### Customization\n\n- Autoscaling\n- Timeline Filtering\n- Line Interpolation\n- Configurable Axis Labels\n- Legends (Labels & Gradient)\n- Advanced Label Positioning\n- Real-time data support\n- Advanced Tooltips\n- Data point Event Handlers\n- Works with ngUpgrade\n\n## Install\n\nTo use ngx-charts in your project install it via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swimlane/ngx-charts):\n\n```\nnpm i @swimlane/ngx-charts --save\n```\n\n## Custom Charts\n\nTo learn how to use the ngx-charts components to build custom charts and find examples, please refer to our [Custom Charts Page](https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-charts/blob/master/docs/custom-charts.md).\n\n## Credits\n\n`ngx-charts` is a [Swimlane](http://swimlane.com) open-source project; we believe in giving back to the open-source community by sharing some of the projects we build for our application.
