When the rate limit is reached all users are blocked from playing/streaming tracks. The stream will be re-enable one day after (at the same time) streams were blocked.\n\nFollow us on twitter for updates [@Soundnodeapp](https://www.twitter.com/soundnodeapp).\n\nFeatured on [Producthunt](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/soundnode-2), [TNW](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2016/01/25/soundnode-is-the-soundcloud-desktop-app-youve-been-waiting-for/#gref)\nand [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/soundnode-turns-soundcloud-into-a-spotify-like-desktop-1754953529)\n\n![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Soundnode/soundnode-app/master/Soundnode-app.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- No need to install\n- Native media keyboard shortcuts\n- Search for new songs\n- Easy navigation\n- Listen to songs from your Stream, Likes, Tracks, Following or Playlists\n- Like songs and save to your liked playlist\n- Full playlist feature\n- Follow/Unfollow users\n\nAnd much more!\n\n## Configuration\n\nSince soundcloud apply rate limit to third party app you need to configure your own API key to make soundnode work.\n\nUnfortunately soundcloud suspended new application creation, so to retrieve your api key, you have to dig into soundcloud website.\n\n* Login to soundcloud.com on favorite browser\n* Look for and api call and write down the client_id parameter\n![dev tools](doc/img/dev_tools.png)\n* Edit your userConfig.json file (see here for location : https://github.com/eliecharra/soundnode-app/blob/master/app/public/js/common/configLocation.js#L34) and update clientId parameter with the previously retrieved one.\n\n## How to contribute\n\nFirst, building, testing, and reporting bugs is highly appreciated.
