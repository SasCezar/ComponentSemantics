Page](https://stackblitz.com/github/dalelotts/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker-demo)\n\n[Github](https://github.com/dalelotts/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker)\n\n\n*Read this in other languages: [Spanish](https://github.com/dalelotts/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/blob/master/README.es_MX.md)*\n\n## On Angular 7.x?\n\nUse install version 3.1.0\n\n`npm install angularjs-bootstrap-datetimepicker@3.1.0`\n\n## On Angular 1.x?\n\nSee [angularjs-bootstrap-datetimepicker](https://github.com/dalelotts/angularjs-bootstrap-datetimepicker)\n\n## Support the project\nI know this is a tiny component but many people use it in production (high 5 to all of us) - if you happen to use this component please click the star button (at the top of the page) - it means a lot to all the contributors.\n\n## Peer Dependencies\n\nPeer dependencies:\n * Angular 8.x or higher (1.x will not work)\n * moment.js 2.22.2 or higher for date parsing and formatting\n * bootstrap 4.x for css/layout\n * open-iconic for the default icon\'s (you can use any icon library you like)\n \njQuery is NOT required.\n\n## Usage with Angular CLI\nIf you are using the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) there are a few simple steps to \nadd this component to your project.\n\nFirst, install this module and it\'s peer dependencies.\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker bootstrap moment open-iconic\n```\n\nThen update `./src/app/app.module.ts` to include the following:\n\n```TypeScript\nimport { AppComponent } from \'./app.component\';\nimport { BrowserModule } from \'@angular/platform-browser\';\nimport { FormsModule } from \'@angular/forms\';\nimport { NgModule } from \'@angular/core\';\nimport { DlDateTimeDateModule, DlDateTimePickerModule } from \'angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker\';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule,\n    DlDateTimeDateModule,  // <--- Determines the data type of the model\n    DlDateTimePickerModule,\n  ],\n  providers: [FormsModule],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\nNext, add the following to `./src/app/app.component.html`\n\n```html\n<dl-date-time-picker\n\tstartView="day"\n\tmaxView="year"\n\tminView="minute"\n\tminuteStep="5"\n\t[(ngModel)]="selectedDate"\n>\n</dl-date-time-picker>\n```\n\nNext, add the following to `./src/styles.css`\n\n```css\n@import \'~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\';\n@import \'~open-iconic/font/css/open-iconic-bootstrap.css\';\n```\n\n**Note:** This component uses `open-iconic` icons by default, but you can use any icon library \nthat supports styling with `classes`.\n\nFinally, run `npm start` and you should see the date/time picker on [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)\n\nBy default, the date/time picker is as wide as it\'s container `{ width:100% }`. \nIt uses bootstrap\'s flex `row` and `col` classes to layout the date/time picker into rows and columns.\nIf the parent container is too narrow (less than 340px in english), the row and column layout may wrap in ways that are not attractive. \nOther languages/locals may require a wider container to fit the contents.\n\n## End-to-End (e2e) testing with protractor\n\nThe user interactions with a date-time picker make it difficult to write e2e tests that exactly replicate the users interaction with the picker.\n\nFortunately, this repository contains a file you can use in your e2e tests to cause the date/time picker to select any specified date.\n\nSee [./e2e/src/dl-date-time-picker-protractor.ts](./e2e/src/dl-date-time-picker-protractor.ts) for details.\n\n## Configuration\n\nUse the [automated configuration generator](https://stackblitz.com/github/dalelotts/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker-demo) (please let me know if it does not work for your use case!), \nor see [https://dalelotts.github.io/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/](https://dalelotts.github.io/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/)\nfor the automatically generated documentation.\n\n### First day of week\n\nThe first day of the week is determined by  [moment\'s i18n settings](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/).\nFor example, setting the locale to `\'fr\'` will cause Monday to be the first day of the week.  \n\n### Display of year, month, day, hour, am/pm, and minute formats\n\nThe format of hours and minutes is also determined by [moment\'s i18n settings](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/).\n\nhours are displayed using `ll` as the format.\nminutes are displayed using `lll` as the format. \n\nI recommend you use the default locale settings from Moment (if they are incorrect, submit a PR to moment to correct the settings)\nIf for some reason the default Moment settings will not work, you can [customize the existing locale](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/) or [create a custom locale](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/adding-locale/) with the desired formats.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can generate the documentation by running `npm run documentation`\nor see [https://dalelotts.github.io/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/](https://dalelotts.github.io/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/)\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe `DlDateTimePickerComponent` component adds `aria-label` attributes to the left, right, and up buttons\nin addition to all calendar cells where the text of the cell may not fully describe the value.\n\n### Keyboard Accessibility \n\nThe `DlDateTimePickerComponent` component supports the following keyboard shortcuts in all views:\n\n| Shortcut             | Action                                          |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| `LEFT_ARROW`         | Go to the cell to the left                      |\n| `RIGHT_ARROW`        | Go to the cell to the right                     |\n| `UP_ARROW`           | Go to the cell above                            |\n| `DOWN_ARROW`         | Go to the cell below                            |\n| `HOME`               | Go to the first cell in the view                |\n| `END`                | Go to the last cell in the view                 |\n| `PAGE_UP`            | Go to the same cell in the previous time period |\n| `PAGE_DOWN`          | Go to the same cell in the next time period     |\n| `ENTER` or `SPACE`   | Select current cell                             |\n\n## Screen
