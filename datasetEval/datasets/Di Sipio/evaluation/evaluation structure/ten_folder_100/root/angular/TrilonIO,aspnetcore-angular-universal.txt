(Just know that you\'d have to provide a mock implementation for the Server when doing that).\n\n- [**Boot.Server.ts**](./ClientApp/boot.server.ts) - \nThis file is where Angular _platform-server_ *serializes* the Angular application itself on the .NET server \nwithin a very quick Node process, and renders it a string. This is what causes that initial fast paint \nof the entire application to the Browser, and helps us get all our _SEO_ goodness :sparkles:\n\n---\n\nNotice the folder structure here in `./ClientApp/` :\n\n```diff\n+ /ClientApp/\n\n+   /app/\n    App NgModule - our Root NgModule (you\'ll insert Components/etc here most often)\n    AppComponent / App Routes / global css styles\n\n    * Notice that we have 2 dividing NgModules:\n        app.module.browser & app.module.server\n    You\'ll almost always be using the common app.module, but these 2 are used to split up platform logic\n    for situations where you need to use Dependency Injection / etc, between platforms.\n\nNote: You could use whatever folder conventions you\'d like, I prefer to split up things in terms of whether they are re-usable \n     "components" or routeable / page-like components that group together and organize entire sections.\n++ > ++ > /components/ \n          Here are all the regular Components that aren\'t "Pages" or container Components\n\n++ > ++ > /containers/\n          These are the routeable or "Page / Container" Components, sometimes known as "Dumb" Components\n\n++ > ++ > /shared/\n          Here we put all shared Services / Directives / Pipes etc\n```\n\nWhen adding new features/components/etc to your application you\'ll be commonly adding things to the Root **NgModule** (located \nin `/ClientApp/app/app.module.ts`), but why are there **two** other NgModules in this folder?\n\nThis is because we want to split our logic **per Platform**, but notice they both share the Common NgModule \nnamed `app.module.ts`. When adding most things to your application, this is the only \nplace you\'ll have to add in your new Component / Directive / Pipe / etc.  You\'ll only occassional need to manually \nadd in the Platform specific things to either `app.module.browser || app.module.server`.\n\nTo illustrate this point with an example, you can see how we\'re using Dependency Injection to inject a `StorageService` that is different \nfor the Browser & Server.\n\n```typescript\n// For the Browser (app.module.browser)\n{ provide: StorageService, useClass: BrowserStorage }\n\n// For the Server (app.module.server)\n{ provide: StorageService, useClass: ServerStorage }\n```\n\n> Just remember, you\'ll usually only need to worry about `app.module.ts`, as that\'s where you\'ll be adding most \nof your applications new aspects!\n\n\n### /Server/ - Our REST API (WebApi) - MVC Controller\n\n> As we pointed out, these are here for simplicities sake, and realistically you may want separate projects \nfor all your microservices / REST API projects / etc.\n\nWe\'re utilizing MVC within this application, but we only need & have ONE Controller, named `HomeController`. This is where our entire \nAngular application gets serialized into a String, sent to the Browser, along with all the assets it needs to then bootstrap on the client-side, and become a full-blown SPA afterwards.\n\n---\n\nThe short-version is that we invoke that Node process, passing in our Request object & invoke the `boot.server` file, and we get back a nice object that we pass into .NETs `ViewData` object, and sprinkle through out our `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` and `/Views/Home/index.cshtml` files!\n\nA more detailed explanation can be found here: [ng-AspnetCore-Engine Readme](https://github.com/angular/universal/tree/master/modules/aspnetcore-engine)\n\n```csharp\n// Prerender / Serialize application\nvar prerenderResult = await Prerenderer.RenderToString(\n    /* all of our parameters / options / boot.server file / customData object goes here */\n);\n\nViewData["SpaHtml"] = prerenderResult.Html;\nViewData["Title"] = prerenderResult.Globals["title"];\nViewData["Styles"] = prerenderResult.Globals["styles"];\nViewData["Meta"] = prerenderResult.Globals["meta"];\nViewData["Links"] = prerenderResult.Globals["links"];\n\nreturn View(); // let\'s render the MVC View\n```\n\nTake a look at the `_Layout.cshtml` file for example, notice how we let .NET handle and inject all our SEO magic (that we extracted from Angular itself) !\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <base href="/" />\n        <!-- Title will be the one you set in your Angular application -->\n        <title>@ViewData["Title"] - AspNET.Core Angular 7.0.0 (+) starter</title>\n\n        <meta charset="utf-8" />\n        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />\n        @Html.Raw(ViewData["Meta"]) <!-- <meta /> tags -->\n        @Html.Raw(ViewData["Links"]) <!-- <link /> tags -->\n        \n        <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/dist/vendor.css" asp-append-version="true" />\n\n        @Html.Raw(ViewData["Styles"]) <!-- <style /> tags -->\n\n    </head>\n    ... etc ...\n```\n\nOur `Views/Home/index.cshtml` simply renders the application and serves the bundled webpack files in it.\n\n```html\n@Html.Raw(ViewData["SpaHtml"])\n\n<script src="~/dist/vendor.js" asp-append-version="true"></script>\n@section scripts {\n    <script src="~/dist/main-client.js" asp-append-version="true"></script>\n}\n```\n\n### What happens after the App gets server rendered?\n\nWell now, your Client-side Angular will take over, and you\'ll have a fully functioning SPA. (But we gained all these great SEO benefits of being server-rendered) !\n\n:sparkles:\n\n\n----\n\n----\n\n# "Gotchas"\n\n- This repository uses ASP.Net Core 2.1, which has a hard requirement on .NET Core Runtime 2.1 and .NET Core SDK 2.1. Please install these items from [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/30/announcing-net-core-2-1/?WT.mc_id=blog-twitter-timheuer)\n\n> When building components in Angular 7 there are a few things to keep in mind.\n\n - Make sure you provide Absolute URLs when calling any APIs. (The server can\'t understand relative paths, so `/api/whatever` will fail).\n \n - API calls will be ran during a server, and once again during the client render, so make sure you\'re using transfering data that\'s important to you so that you don\'t see a flicker.\n\n - **`window`**, **`document`**, **`navigator`**, and other browser types - _do not exist on the server_ - so using them, or any library that uses them (jQuery for example) will not work. You do have some options, if you truly need some of this functionality:\n    - If you need to use them, consider limiting them to only your client and wrapping them situationally. You can use the Object injected using the PLATFORM_ID token to check whether the current platform is browser or server. \n    \n    ```typescript\n     import { PLATFORM_ID } from \'@angular/core\';\n     import { isPlatformBrowser, isPlatformServer } from \'@angular/common\';\n     \n     constructor(@Inject(PLATFORM_ID) private platformId: Object) { ... }\n     \n     ngOnInit() {\n       if (isPlatformBrowser(this.platformId)) {\n          // Client only code.\n          ...\n       }\n       if (isPlatformServer(this.platformId)) {\n         // Server only code.\n         ...\n       }\n     }\n    ```\n    \n     - Try to *limit or* **avoid** using **`setTimeout`**. It will slow down the server-side rendering process. Make sure to remove them [`ngOnDestroy`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/OnDestroy-class.html) in Components.\n   - Also for RxJs timeouts, make sure to _cancel_ their stream on success, for they can slow down rendering as well.\n - **Don\'t manipulate the nativeElement directly**. Use the _Renderer2_. We do this to ensure that in any environment we\'re able to change our view.\n```typescript\nconstructor(element: ElementRef, renderer: Renderer2) {\n  this.renderer.setStyle(element.nativeElement, \'font-size\', \'x-large\');\n}\n```\n - The application runs XHR requests on the server & once again on the Client-side (when the application bootstraps)\n    - Use a cache that\'s transferred from server to client (TODO: Point to the example)\n - Know the difference between attributes and properties in relation to the DOM.\n - Keep your directives stateless as much as possible. For stateful directives, you may need to provide an attribute that reflects the corresponding property with an initial string value such as url in img tag. For our native element the src attribute is reflected as the src property of the element type HTMLImageElement.\n - Error: `sass-loader` requires `node-sass` >=4: Either in the docker container or localhost run <b>npm rebuild node-sass -f</b>\n\n----\n\n----\n \n# FAQ - Also check out the [!FAQ Issues label!](https://github.com/MarkPieszak/aspnetcore-angular2-universal/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Afaq) and the [!HOW-TO Issues Label!](https://github.com/MarkPieszak/aspnetcore-angular2-universal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22HOW+TO+-+Guide%22)\n\n### How can I disable SSR (Server-side rendering)?\n\nSimply comment out the logic within HomeController, and replace `@Html.Raw(ViewData["SpaHtml"])` with just your applications root \nAppComponent tag ("app-root" in our case): `<app-root></app-root>`.\n\n> You could also remove any `isPlatformBrowser/etc` logic, and delete the boot.server, app.module.browser & app.module.server files, just make sure your `boot.browser` file points to `app.module`.\n\n### How do I have code run only in the Browser?\n\nCheck the [Gotchas](#gotchas) on how to use `isPlatformBrowser()`.\n\n### How do I Material2 with this repo?\n\n~~You\'ll either want to remove SSR for now, or wait as support should be coming to handle platform-server rendering.~~\nThis is now possible, with the recently updated Angular Material changes. We do not have a tutorial available for this yet.\n\n### How can I use jQuery and/or some jQuery plugins with this repo?\n\n> Note: If at all possible, try to avoid using jQuery or libraries dependent on it, as there are \nbetter, more abstract ways of dealing with the DOM in Angular (5+) such as using the Renderer, etc.\n\nYes, of course but there are a few things you need to setup before doing this. First, make sure jQuery \nis included in webpack vendor file, and that you have a webpack Plugin setup for it. `new webpack.ProvidePlugin({ $: \'jquery\', jQuery: \'jquery\' })`\n\nNow, make sure any "plugins" etc that you have, are only included in your `boot.browser.ts` file. (ie: `import \'slick-carousel\';`) \nIn a Component you want to use jQuery, make sure to import it near the top like so:\n\n```typescript\nimport * as $ from \'jquery\';\n```\n\n**Always make sure to wrap anything jQuery oriented in Angular\'s `isPlatformBrowser()` conditional!**\n\n### How can I support IE9 through IE11?\n\nTo support IE9 through IE11 open the `polyfills.ts` file in the `polyfills` folder and uncomment out the \'import polyfills\' as needed. ALSO - make sure that your `webpack.config` and `webpack.config.vendor` change option of `TerserPlugin` from `ecma: 6` to **`ecma: 5`**.\n\n----\n\n# Special Thanks\n\nMany thanks go out to Steve Sanderson ([@SteveSandersonMS](https://github.com/SteveSandersonMS)) from Microsoft and his amazing work on JavaScriptServices and integrating the world of Node with ASP.NET Core.\n\nAlso thank you to the many Contributors !\n- [@GRIMMR3AP3R](https://github.com/GRIMMR3AP3R)\n- [@Isaac2004](https://github.com/Isaac2004)\n- [@AbrarJahin](https://github.com/AbrarJahin)\n- [@LiverpoolOwen](https://github.com/LiverpoolOwen)\n- [@hakonamatata](https://github.com/hakonamatata)\n- [@markwhitfeld](https://github.com/markwhitfeld)\n- [@Ketrex](https://github.com/Ketrex)\n\n----\n \n# Found a Bug?
