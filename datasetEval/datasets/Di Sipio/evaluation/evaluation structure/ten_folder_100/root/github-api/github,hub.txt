b'hub is a command line tool that wraps `git` in order to extend it with extra\nfeatures and commands that make working with GitHub easier.\n\nThis repository and its issue tracker is **not for reporting problems with\nGitHub.com** web interface. If you have a problem with GitHub itself, please\n[contact Support](https://github.com/contact).\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n``` sh\n$ hub clone rtomayko/tilt\n\n# expands to:\n#=> git clone git://github.com/rtomayko/tilt.git\n```\n\nhub can be safely [aliased](#aliasing) as `git` so you can type `$ git\n<command>` in the shell and get all the usual `hub` features.\n\nSee [Usage documentation](https://hub.github.com/hub.1.html) for the list of all\ncommands and their arguments.\n\nhub can also be used to make shell scripts that [manually interface with the\nGitHub API](https://hub.github.com/hub-api.1.html).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe `hub` executable has no dependencies, but since it was designed to wrap\n`git`, it\'s recommended to have at least **git 1.7.3** or newer.\n\nplatform | manager | command to run\n---------|---------|---------------\nmacOS, Linux | [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) | `brew install hub`\nWindows | [Scoop](http://scoop.sh/) | `scoop install hub`\nWindows | [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) | `choco install hub`\nFedora Linux | [DNF](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DNF) | `sudo dnf install hub`\nArch Linux | [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman) | `sudo pacman -S hub`\nFreeBSD | [pkg(8)](http://man.freebsd.org/pkg/8) | `pkg install hub`\nDebian | [apt(8)](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/apt/apt.8.en.html) | `sudo apt install hub`\nUbuntu | [Snap](https://snapcraft.io) | `snap install hub --classic`\n\n#### Standalone\n\n`hub` can be easily installed as an executable. Download the latest\n[compiled binaries](https://github.com/github/hub/releases) and put it anywhere\nin your executable path.\n\n#### Source\n\nPrerequisites for building from source are:\n\n* `make`\n* [Go 1.9+](https://golang.org/doc/install)\n\nClone this repository and run `make install`:\n\n```sh\ngit clone \\\n  --config transfer.fsckobjects=false \\\n  --config receive.fsckobjects=false \\\n  --config fetch.fsckobjects=false \\\n  https://github.com/github/hub.git\n\ncd hub\nmake install prefix=/usr/local\n```\n\nThis assumes support for [Go 1.11+\nmodules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). If you are building on an\nolder version of Go, you will need to clone the repository into\n`$GOPATH/src/github.com/github/hub`.\n\nAliasing\n--------\n\nSome hub features feel best when it\'s aliased as `git`. This is not dangerous; your\n_normal git commands will all work_. hub merely adds some sugar.\n\n`hub alias` displays instructions for the current shell. With the `-s` flag, it\noutputs a script suitable for `eval`.\n\nYou should place this command in your `.bash_profile` or other startup script:\n\n``` sh\neval "$(hub alias -s)"\n```\n\n#### PowerShell\n\nIf you\'re using PowerShell, you can set an alias for `hub` by placing the\nfollowing in your PowerShell profile (usually\n`~/Documents/WindowsPowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`):\n\n``` sh\nSet-Alias git hub\n```\n\nA simple way to do this is to run the following from the PowerShell prompt:\n\n``` sh\nAdd-Content $PROFILE "`nSet-Alias git hub"\n```\n\nNote: You\'ll need to restart your PowerShell console in order for the changes to be picked up.\n\nIf your PowerShell profile doesn\'t exist, you can create it by running the following:\n\n``` sh\nNew-Item -Type file -Force $PROFILE\n```\n\n### Shell tab-completion\n\nhub repository contains tab-completion scripts for bash, zsh and fish.\nThese scripts complement existing completion scripts that ship with git.\n\n[Installation instructions](etc)\n\n* [hub bash completion](https://github.com/github/hub/blob/master/etc/hub.bash_completion.sh)\n* [hub zsh completion](https://github.com/github/hub/blob/master/etc/hub.zsh_completion)\n* [hub fish completion](https://github.com/github/hub/blob/master/etc/hub.fish_completion)\n\nMeta\n----\n\n* Home: <https://github.com/github/hub>\n* Bugs: <https://github.com/github/hub/issues>\n* Authors: <https://github.com/github/hub/contributors>\n'
