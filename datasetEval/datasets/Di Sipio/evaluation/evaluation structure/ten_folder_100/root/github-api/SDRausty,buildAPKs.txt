b'[buildAPKs](https://github.com/SDRausty/buildAPKs)\n\nBuildAPKs has [source code](https://github.com/BuildAPKs) and [scripts](https://github.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs/tree/master/scripts/) in order to build APKs (Android Package Kits) on Android handhelds, and similar.  Quick setup instructions can be found here at https://sdrausty.github.io/docsBuildAPKs/setup and also https://sdrausty.github.io/docsBuildAPKs/reallyEasilyBuildAndroidAPKsOnDevice right here.\n\nYou can try building hundreds of exciting, amazing and beautiful APKs by running [shell scripts](https://www.google.com/search?q=shell+scripts) from [this directory](https://github.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs/tree/master/scripts/bash/build).  It is simple!  The minimal install size to start building your first apps (6) is about 10MB!  Have fun and enjoy compiling, hacking, modifying and running these select APKs!\n\n**Cloning and updating [submodules](https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255) is automated into the build\\*.bash scripts.  If you recieve a history error message from `git pull`, the simplest solution is `mv ~/buildAPKs ~/b0` and then reclone into the $HOME folder.**  The `~/buildAPKs/sources/github` directory can be a symbolic link to external storage space to save native space on device.  Prefix the build*.bash scripts with bash to run buildAPKs in external storage, e.g. [`$ bash buildFlashlights.bash`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs/master/scripts/bash/build/buildFlashlights.bash).\n\nBuild Android APKs on device (smartphone and tablet).\n\nBuild Android APKs on device, on your smartphone and tablet with [Termux](https://github.com/termux/); Make applications for your Android smartphone and tablet! This repository contains source code for various Android applications that have been successfully built in [Termux](https://github.com/termux/).\n\nHave you ever wanted to build your own application? Something that you can distribute over the Internet, and can be used on Android smartphones and tablets worldwide.  Would you dare to try to spend some time learning something new to do so?\n\n[BuildAPKs](https://github.com/BuildAPKs) is a repository of source code designed just for this purpose.  Source code is the way programs are written in a human understandable language for applications to compile and then to be run on an Android device.  These programs have been tested and were built successfully on device, a smartphone.  First successful builds on Sun May 28 2017 in [Termux](https://github.com/termux/) (Android 6.0.1 aarch64).\n\nSee https://sdrausty.github.io/docsBuildAPKs/reallyEasilyBuildAndroidAPKsOnDevice for quick setup instructions and https://sdrausty.github.io/docsBuildAPKs for the documentation website for this project.  \n\nThis command: `for i in $(cat ~/buildAPKs/var/db/UNAMES) ; do ~/buildAPKs/scripts/bash/build/build.github.bash $i ; done`shall attempt to build [UNAMES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs/master/var/db/UNAMES), all known GitHub usernames, while: `for i in $(cat ~/buildAPKs/var/db/TNAMES) ; do ~/buildAPKs/scripts/bash/build/build.github.bash $i ; done`shall attempt to build [TNAMES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs/master/var/db/TNAMES), all known GitHub topics @GitHub.  Please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs/pulls) if you want a name added to these listings.\n\n### Really Easily Build an Android APK on an Android Device (Smartphone and Tablet).\n\nPrefix these bash scripts by typing dot slash `./` on your Android smartphone and tablet in Termux, i.e. type `./b` at the prompt ($), press TAB TAB (x2).  The prompt should magically add `uild`; Then add a capitol `A`.  Press TAB TAB (x2) again.  This should build the following command on the command line [`./buildAll.bash`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs/master/scripts/bash/build/buildAll.bash) for you.  Press enter (return) in `~/buildAPKs/`.  Additional CLI information at [The Linux Documentation Project.](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=command+line+beginner+site%3Atldp.org)\n\nThe built APKs will be deposited into Download/builtAPKs for installing on smartphone and tablet through browsers, and download and file managers.  The minimal install size to start building your first applications is about 10MB.  Have fun and enjoy compiling, hacking, modifying and running these select APKs on device!\n\nThe [`buildAll.bash`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs/master/scripts/bash/build/buildAll.bash) command can build hundreds of APKs on your device.  Maximum space allotment for complete build of everything included (755) is about 850MB for buildAPKs, plus about 74MB for the finished products deposited into /storage/emulated/0/Download/builtAPKs;  More than seven hundred and fifty five (755) Android applications can be made from source code on device today.\n\nContribute to this project through both [the issues page](https://github.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs/pulls).
