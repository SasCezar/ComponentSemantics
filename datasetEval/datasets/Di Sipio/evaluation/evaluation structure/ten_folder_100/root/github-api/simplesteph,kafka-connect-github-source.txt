b"# Learning\n\nThis project is a companion repository to the [Apache Kafka Connect course on Udemy](https://links.datacumulus.com/kafka-connect-coupon). \n\nhttps://links.datacumulus.com/kafka-connect-coupon\n\n# Kafka Connect Source GitHub\n\nThis connector allows you to get a stream of issues and pull requests from your GitHub repository, using the GitHub Api: https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#list-issues-for-a-repository\n\nIssues are pulled based on `updated_at` field, meaning any update to an issue or pull request will appear in the stream. \n\nThe connector writes to topic that is great candidate to demonstrate *log compaction*. It's also a fun way to automate your GitHub workflow. \n\nIt's finally aimed to be an educative example to demonstrate how to write a Source Connector a little less trivial than the `FileStreamSourceConnector` provided in Kafka.\n\n# Contributing\n\nThis connector is not perfect and can be improved, please feel free to submit any PR you deem useful. \n\n# Configuration\n\n```\nname=GitHubSourceConnectorDemo\ntasks.max=1\nconnector.class=com.simplesteph.kafka.GitHubSourceConnector\ntopic=github-issues\ngithub.owner=kubernetes\ngithub.repo=kubernetes\nsince.timestamp=2017-01-01T00:00:00Z\n# I heavily recommend you set those two fields:\nauth.username=your_username\nauth.password=your_password\n```\n\n# Running in development\n\nNote: Java 8 is required for this connector. \nMake sure `config/worker.properties` is configured to wherever your kafka cluster is\n\n```\n./build.sh\n./run.sh \n```\n\nThe simplest way to run `run.sh` is to have docker installed. It will pull a Dockerfile and run the connector in standalone mode above it. \n\n# Deploying\n\nNote: Java 8 is required for this connector. \n\nTODO\n"
