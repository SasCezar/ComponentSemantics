It gets the list of AWS keys to scan by directly connecting to the AWS API.\n\n== \xf0\x9f\x9a\x81 System Overview\n\n* Polling loop to monitor all AWS keys for users of the AWS account\n* Polling loop to monitor Github activity of all users in your github organization(s)\n* Reactively nuke any AWS keys detected to have leaked to Github via the AWS API\n\nimage::docs/diagrams/architecture.png[Architecture]\n\n== \xe2\x8f\xb1 System Interaction w/ Timeline\n\nimage::docs/diagrams/dataflow.png[Data Flow]\n\n== \xf0\x9f\x9b\xa0 Installing KeyNuker \xf0\x9f\x94\x90\xf0\x9f\x92\xa5\n\nKeyNuker is packaged as a series of https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk[Apache OpenWhisk] actions, and can run anywhere that OpenWhisk can run.\n\nGet the code:\n\n```\n$ go get -u -v -t github.com/tleyden/keynuker\n```\n\nFollow the steps in the link:docs/install.adoc[Installation Instructions] to setup OpenWhisk and set the required environment variables, and then run the installation script.\n\n```\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tleyden/keynuker/\n$ python install.py\n```\n\nAfter the installation script completes, you will have several OpenWhisk actions:\n\n```\n$ wsk action list\n/yourusername_dev/github-user-events-scanner-nuker                     private sequence\n/yourusername_dev/fetch-aws-keys-write-doc                             private sequence\netc ...\n```\n\n== \xe2\x9c\x85 Features\n\n. Never has access to AWS Secret Access Keys, only to AWS Access Key IDs.\n. Noise-free because it scans actual AWS keys rather than taking a pattern matching approach that produces false positives\n. Takes actions rather than sending alerts, since depending on people to respond to alerts might introduce a costly delay in reaction time\n. Covers all public github activity of users in your github org(s), since they might leak AWS keys on their personal repos or even 3rd party repos\n. Requires minimal IAM Permissions: `iam:DeleteAccessKey`, `iam:ListAccessKeys`, `iam:ListUsers`\n. Ultra-low baseline running cost due to serverless architecture\n. Lowest common denominator and requires zero effort or workflow change for users\n\n== \xe2\x9a\xaa\xef\xb8\x8f Roadmap / Goals\n\n. Low-latency round trip between AWS keys leaking and being nuked.  Currently uses polling approach, but the goal is to layer a webhook approach on top in order to lower the latency.\n. Scale up to monitoring hundreds of AWS accounts and thousands of github organizations/repos/users.\n. Cove as much of the Github API surface area as possible (gists, issue comments, etc)\n. Pluggable architecture so that other cloud key providers (Google Cloud Platform, Azure, etc) and other leak sources (BitBucket, Jira, etc) can be added later.\n\n\n== \xf0\x9f\x8f\x81 Project status: Early alpha stage\n\nThe basic end-to-end functionality is working, except for notifications, but there are still a lot of places where AWS keys can leak to Github and go undetected:\n\n * Github Gists\n * Other Github API surface area that isn\'t covered yet\n\n\n== \xf0\x9f\x93\x93 Documentation\n\n.Documentation\n|===\n|Doc |Link\n\n|README (this document)\n|link:README.adoc[README]\n\n|Installation guide\n|link:docs/install.adoc[Installation Instructions]\n\n|Post-installation verification\n|link:docs/verify.adoc[Verify Installation]\n\n|Developer guide\n|link:docs/developers.adoc[Developer guide]\n\n|AWS Security Resources\n|link:docs/aws_security_resources.adoc[AWS Security Resources]\n\n|===\n\n\n== \xf0\x9f\x93\xb0 Articles on malicious key scraping\n\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044323/https://www.forbes.com/sites/runasandvik/2014/01/14/attackers-scrape-github-for-cloud-service-credentials-hijack-account-to-mine-virtual-currency/#41d040f67cf8:[Attackers Scrape GitHub For Cloud Service Credentials, Hijack Account To Mine Virtual Currency]\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20170111080816/http://www.itnews.com.au/news/aws-urges-developers-to-scrub-github-of-secret-keys-375785[AWS urges developers to scrub GitHub of secret keys]\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20170205165621/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/06/dev_blunder_shows_github_crawling_with_keyslurping_bots/[Dev put AWS keys on Github.
