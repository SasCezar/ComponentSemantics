b'# GitHub.Ecto\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wojtekmach/github_ecto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wojtekmach/github_ecto)\n\n## Example\n\n```elixir\n# Paste below to iex\n\n# 0. Install this application (see instructions at the end of the README)\n\n# 1. Define `Repo` (or `GitHub` or whatever):\ndefmodule Repo do\n  use Ecto.Repo,\n    otp_app: :my_app,\n    adapter: GitHub.Ecto\nend\n\n# 2. Configure this application. In a real project you\'d configure it in config/*.exs as does every other adapter.\nApplication.put_env(:my_app, Repo, [\n  token: nil # set to a string to be able to write or access private repos. Be careful!\n])\n\n# 3. Start the Repo process. In a real project you\'d put the Repo module in your project\'s supervision tree:\n{:ok, _pid} = Repo.start_link\n\n# 4. Import Ecto.Query\nimport Ecto.Query\n\n# 5. List titles and comment counts of all open feature requests in Ecto, sorted by comment counts:\nq = from(i in GitHub.Issue, # or: from i in "issues" for all fields that API returns\n         select: {i.title, i.comments},\n         where: i.repo == "elixir-ecto/ecto" and\n                i.state == "open" and\n                "Kind:Feature" in i.labels,\n         order_by: [desc: :comments])\nRepo.all(q)\n# => [{"Introducing Ecto.Multi", 60},\n#     {"Support map update syntax", 14},\n#     {"Create test db from development schema", 9},\n#     {"Provide integration tests with ownership with Hound", 0}]\n# (as of 2015-02-14)\n\n# 6. (optional) Create an issue if something doesn\'t look right :-)\nissue = Repo.insert!(%GitHub.Issue{title: "Something went wrong", body: "Everything\'s broken", repo: "wojtekmach/github_ecto"})\n\n# 7. (optional) Mark the issue as resolved.\nRepo.update!(GitHub.Issue.changeset(issue, %{state: "closed"}))\n```\n\nSee more examples of usage in [tests](test/github_ecto_test.exs). Also see the [Ecto API](http://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html) and [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3).\n\n## Why?\n\nFirst of all this library is in a very early stage and isn\'t suitable for production use.\nSecond of all, it may never be suitable for production use :-)\nThere\'re already existing wrappers for GitHub API and, honestly, it may or may not be such a good\nidea to wrap it with Ecto. The primary goal of this project is for me to learn more about Ecto and it\'s internals and secondarily to build something useful :-)\n\n## Installation\n\n  1. Add `github_ecto` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:\n\n    ```elixir\n    def deps do\n      [{:github_ecto, github: "wojtekmach/github_ecto"}]\n    end\n    ```\n\n  2. Ensure `github_ecto` is started before your application:\n\n    ```elixir\n    def application do\n      [applications: [:logger, :github_ecto, :ecto]]\n    end\n    ```\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Wojciech Mach\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
