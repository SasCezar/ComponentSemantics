More features are on their way!_\n\n## Usage\n\n### Setup\n\n#### Prerequisites\n- To work on this repo on your local environment, you would need to generate register your flavour of this app with GitHub in order to access the GitHub OAuth API.\n  - Please follow the steps [here](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/), in order to set up your credentials for using this app.\n\n#### Setting up the project in Android Studio\n- Once you are done with this, create a file with the name "debug_gradle.properties", and paste the following code:\n```groovy\ngithub_client_id=<Client ID Generated in Step 1>\ngithub_secret=<Secret ID Generated in Step 1>\nredirect_url=androci://callback\n```\n- Change the `Build Variants` of both the main App and the APICommunicator Library to `debug`.\n- Now, just rebuild the project in android studio, and it should work.\n\n### Package Structure\nThe app is divided into two Components:\n- The `APICommunicator` Library, which provides an interface to make API Calls and Authorization Requests via GitHub and Travis APIs.\n- The `AndroCI` app, which is basically a front end, and has the `APICommunicator` Library as a dependency.\n\n\n| APICommunicator | AndroCI \n|:-------------:|:-------------:\n| ![APICommunicator](https://github.com/siddharth2010/AndroCI/blob/master/screenshots/rest_services.png) | ![AndroCI](https://github.com/siddharth2010/AndroCI/blob/master/screenshots/front_end.png)\n\n\n## Libraries in Use\n- [**Retrofit**](https://github.com/square/retrofit) for constructing the REST API\n- [**Picasso**](https://github.com/square/picasso) for loading images\n- [**Gson**](https://github.com/google/gson) to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa\n- [**Gson Converter**](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/gson) for serialization to and from JSON\n'
