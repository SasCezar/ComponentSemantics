b'Coderockr Way Github Setup\n--------------------------\nUsing this script your project will be bootstraped with the basic labels needed to control your issues according with the *Coderockr Way* methodology\n\nYou can take a look here: https://github.com/coderockr/coderockr-way-github-setup/labels\n\nWe now support setting up projects on [GitHub](#github) and [GitLab](#gitlab), click in the links to see more.\n\nHow to use\n----------\n\n### GitHub\n\nThis repository has a script named [`coderockr-way-github-setup.bash`](coderockr-way-github-setup.bash) there are two ways to use it.\n\n 1) You could just call it direct from GitHub using cURL, and it will ask you the info to updated your repository:\n\n```bash\n$ bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coderockr/coderockr-way-github-setup/master/coderockr-way-github-setup.bash)"\nType your Github repository name (owner/repo_name): lucassabreu/coderockr-way-github-setup\nType your Github username: lucassabreu\nType your Github password (won\'t be shown):\n```\n\n 2) Or you [install into your machine](#install) and run it directly setting parameters (or not and it will be asked as shown before):\n\nUsage: `coderockr-way-github-setup -u githubUser -p githubPassword owner/repo`\n\n```\n    --user, -u      GitHub username\n    --password, -p  GitHub password\n    --verbose, -v   Details process\n```\n\n#### Using Github Token\n\nIf you\'re using github token you must set the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`, then the script will ignore and won\'t ask for your username and password\n\n### GitLab\n\nMuch like the GitHub script, this repository has a script named [`coderockr-way-gitlab-setup.bash`](coderockr-way-gitlab-setup.bash) and there are two ways to use it.\n\n 1) Just run it directly from GitHub using cURL, a GitLab [personal token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/README.html#personal-access-tokens) and projects name (owner/project) will be asked:\n\n```bash\n$ bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coderockr/coderockr-way-gitlab-setup/master/coderockr-way-gitlab-setup.bash)"\nType your GitLab repository name (owner/repo_name): coderockr/awesome-project\nType your GitLab Private-token: <private-token>\n```\n\n 2) Or, after [installing it](#gitlab-setup), you can run it directly with parameters (or not and they will be asked as if you were running from GitHub)\n\nUsage: `./coderockr-way-gitlab-setup.bash --token gitlab-private-token [-u http://gitlab.example.com] owner/repo`\n\n```\n    --help, -h    Show this help\n    --token, -t   GitLab Private-Token (defaults to $GITLAB_TOKEN)\n    --url, -u     GitLab base URL (defaults to $GITLAB_URL or https://gitlab.com)\n    --verbose, -v Details process\n```\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nTo install into your machine just run the commands bellow, and then use the command `coderockr-way-github-setup` or `coderockr-way-gitlab-setup`.\n\n#### GitHub Setup\n\n```sh\ncurl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coderockr/coderockr-way-github-setup/master/coderockr-way-github-setup.bash" -o "/usr/local/bin/coderockr-way-github-setup"\nchmod a+x /usr/local/bin/coderockr-way-github-setup\n```\n\n#### GitLab Setup\n\n```sh\ncurl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coderockr/coderockr-way-github-setup/master/coderockr-way-gitlab-setup.bash" -o "/usr/local/bin/coderockr-way-gitlab-setup"\nchmod a+x /usr/local/bin/coderockr-way-gitlab-setup\n```\n'
