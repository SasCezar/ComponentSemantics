b'# PHP GitHub API\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KnpLabs/php-github-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KnpLabs/php-github-api)\n[![StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/3948501/shield?style=flat)](https://styleci.io/repos/3948501)\n[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/knplabs/github-api/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/knplabs/github-api)\n[![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/knplabs/github-api/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/knplabs/github-api)\n[![Latest Unstable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/knplabs/github-api/v/unstable)](https://packagist.org/packages/knplabs/github-api)\n[![Monthly Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/knplabs/github-api/d/monthly)](https://packagist.org/packages/knplabs/github-api)\n[![Daily Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/knplabs/github-api/d/daily)](https://packagist.org/packages/knplabs/github-api)\n\nA simple Object Oriented wrapper for GitHub API, written with PHP.\n\nUses [GitHub API v3](http://developer.github.com/v3/) & supports [GitHub API v4](http://developer.github.com/v4). The object API (v3) is very similar to the RESTful API.\n\n## Features\n\n* Light and fast thanks to lazy loading of API classes\n* Extensively tested and documented\n\n## Requirements\n\n* PHP >= 7.1\n* A [HTTP client](https://packagist.org/providers/php-http/client-implementation)\n* A [PSR-7 implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-message-implementation)\n* (optional) PHPUnit to run tests.\n\n## Install\n\nVia Composer:\n\n```bash\n$ composer require knplabs/github-api php-http/guzzle6-adapter "^1.1"\n```\n\nWhy `php-http/guzzle6-adapter`? We are decoupled from any HTTP messaging client with help by [HTTPlug](http://httplug.io/). Read about clients in our [docs](doc/customize.md).\n\n\n## Using Laravel?\n\n[Laravel GitHub](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-GitHub) by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell) might interest you.\n\n## Basic usage of `php-github-api` client\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n// This file is generated by Composer\nrequire_once __DIR__ . \'/vendor/autoload.php\';\n\n$client = new \\Github\\Client();\n$repositories = $client->api(\'user\')->repositories(\'ornicar\');\n```\n\nFrom `$client` object, you can access to all GitHub.\n\n## Cache usage\n\nThis example uses the PSR6 cache pool [redis-adapter](https://github.com/php-cache/redis-adapter). See http://www.php-cache.com/ for alternatives.\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n// This file is generated by Composer\nrequire_once __DIR__ . \'/vendor/autoload.php\';\n\nuse Cache\\Adapter\\Redis\\RedisCachePool;\n\n$client = new \\Redis();\n$client->connect(\'127.0.0.1\', 6379);\n// Create a PSR6 cache pool\n$pool = new RedisCachePool($client);\n\n$client = new \\Github\\Client();\n$client->addCache($pool);\n\n// Do some request\n\n// Stop using cache\n$client->removeCache();\n```\n\nUsing cache, the client will get cached responses if resources haven\'t changed since last time,\n**without** reaching the `X-Rate-Limit` [imposed by github](http://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee the [`doc` directory](doc/) for more detailed documentation.\n\n## License\n\n`php-github-api` is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details\n\n## Maintainers\n\nPlease read [this post](https://knplabs.com/en/blog/news-for-our-foss-projects-maintenance) first.\n\nThis library is maintained by the following people (alphabetically sorted) :\n- @acrobat\n- @Nyholm\n\n## Contributors\n\n- Thanks to [Thibault Duplessis aka. ornicar](http://github.com/ornicar) for his first version of this library.\n- Thanks to [Joseph Bielawski aka. stloyd](http://github.com/stloyd) for his contributions and support.\n- Thanks to [noloh](http://github.com/noloh) for his contribution on the Object API.\n- Thanks to [bshaffer](http://github.com/bshaffer) for his contribution on the Repo API.\n- Thanks to [Rolf van de Krol](http://github.com/rolfvandekrol) for his countless contributions.\n- Thanks to [Nicolas Pastorino](http://github.com/jeanvoye) for his contribution on the Pull Request API.\n- Thanks to [Edoardo Rivello](http://github.com/erivello) for his contribution on the Gists API.\n- Thanks to [Miguel Piedrafita](https://github.com/m1guelpf) for his contribution to the v4 & Apps API.\n\nThanks to GitHub for the high quality API and documentation.\n'
