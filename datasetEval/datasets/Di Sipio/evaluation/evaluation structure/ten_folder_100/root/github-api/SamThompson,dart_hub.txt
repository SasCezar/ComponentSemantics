b"# dart_hub\n\nA GitHub client written in flutter. The goal of this project is to build something non-trivial in Flutter to flex the framework's muscles.\n\n## Building\n\nIn order to build this project, you'll need to add a `keys.dart` file to the `lib/` directory of this project.\nThis file contains the oauth client id and client secret necessary to communicate with the GitHub apis.\nInside the file you'll need to define two constants:\n```dart\nconst String CLIENT_ID = 'your oauth client id';\nconst String CLIENT_SECRET = 'your oauth client secret';\n```\nYou can create an oauth api project [here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).\n\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Feed\n![Activity feed](screenshots/feed.png) \n\n### Profile\n![Profile](screenshots/profile.png) ![Repositories](screenshots/repos.png) ![Followers](screenshots/followers.png) ![Following](screenshots/following.png)\n\n### Repo\n![Repo](screenshots/repo.png)\n\n## TODO\n\n- [x] Activity feed showing recent activity\n- [x] Notifications ui which shows unread notifications\n- [x] Profile ui that shows current logged in user\n- [x] Implement pagination on list screens\n- [x] Implement follower listing view\n- [x] Implement following listing view\n- [x] Move notifications in between search and profile\n- [x] Implement repo listing view\n- [x] Implement showing user activity on profile\n- [x] Repository screen\n- [ ] Event items clickable\n- [ ] Notif items clickable\n- [ ] Add ui for filter parameters on notifs, repos, etc\n- [ ] Implement search view\n- [ ] File viewer\n- [ ] Support more event types\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project is moving pretty fast and I'm doing a lot of development on master.
