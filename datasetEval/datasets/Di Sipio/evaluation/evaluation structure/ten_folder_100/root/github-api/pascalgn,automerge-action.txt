b'# automerge-action\n\nGitHub action to automatically merge pull requests when they are ready.\n\n<img src="https://pascalgn.github.io/automerge-action/screenshot.svg" width="100%">\n\nWhen added, this action will run the following tasks on pull requests with the\n`automerge` label:\n\n- Changes from the base branch will automatically be merged into the pull\n  request (only when "Require branches to be up to date before merging"\n  is enabled in the branch protection rules)\n- When the pull request is ready, it will automatically be merged\n- Pull requests without any configured labels will be ignored\n\nLabels, merge and update strategies are configurable, see [Configuration](#configuration).\n\nA pull request is considered ready when:\n\n1. the required number of review approvals has been given (if enabled in the\n   branch protection rules) and\n2. the required checks have passed (if enabled in the branch protection rules)\n   and\n3. the pull request is up to date (if enabled in the branch protection rules)\n\nAfter the pull request has been merged successfully, the branch will _not_ be\ndeleted. To delete branches after they are merged,\nsee [automatic deletion of branches](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches).\n\n## Usage\n\nCreate a new `.github/workflows/automerge.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\nname: automerge\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types:\n      - labeled\n      - unlabeled\n      - synchronize\n      - opened\n      - edited\n      - ready_for_review\n      - reopened\n      - unlocked\n  pull_request_review:\n    types:\n      - submitted\n  status: {}\njobs:\n  automerge:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: automerge\n        uses: "pascalgn/automerge-action@2c8e667a3386187418587517e5bfe33470d19b5b"\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe following merge options are supported:\n\n- `MERGE_LABELS`: The labels that need to be present for a pull request to be\n  merged (using `MERGE_METHOD`). The default value is `automerge`.\n\n  This option can be a comma-separated list of labels that will be checked. All\n  labels in the list need to be present, otherwise the pull request will be\n  skipped (until all labels are present). Labels prefixed with an exclamation\n  mark (`!`) will block a pull request from being merged, when present.\n\n  For example, when `automerge,!wip,!work in progress` is given,\n  any pull requests with the labels `wip` or `work in progress` and any pull\n  requests _without_ the label `automerge` will not be merged.\n  Blocking labels take precedence, so if a pull request has both labels\n  `wip` and `automerge`, it will not be merged.\n\n  When an empty string (`""`) is given, all pull requests will be merged.\n\n- `MERGE_METHOD`: Which method to use when merging the pull request into\n  the base branch. Possible values are\n  [`merge`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges) (create a merge commit),\n  [`rebase`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits)\n  (rebase all commits of the branch onto the base branch)\n  or [`squash`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits)\n  (squash all commits into a single commit). The default option is `merge`.\n\n- `MERGE_COMMIT_MESSAGE`: The commit message to use when merging the pull\n  request into the base branch. Possible values are `automatic` (use GitHub\'s\n  default message), `pull-request-title` (use the pull request\'s title),\n  `pull-request-description` (use the pull request\'s description), and\n  `pull-request-title-and-description`. The default value is `automatic`.\n\n- `MERGE_FORKS`: Whether merging from external repositories is enabled\n  or not. By default, pull requests with branches from forked repositories will\n  be merged the same way as pull requests with branches from the main\n  repository. Set this option to `false` to disable merging of pull requests\n  from forked repositories.\n\n- `MERGE_RETRIES` and `MERGE_RETRY_SLEEP`: Sometimes, the pull request check\n  runs haven\'t finished yet, so the action will retry the merge after some time.\n  The number of retries can be set with `MERGE_RETRIES`.\n  The default number of retries is `6` and setting it to `0` disables the retry logic.\n  `MERGE_RETRY_SLEEP` sets the time to sleep between retries, in milliseconds.\n  The default is `10000` (10 seconds) and setting it to `0` disables sleeping\n  between retries.\n\nThe following update options are supported:\n\n- `UPDATE_LABELS`: The labels that need to be present for a pull request to be\n  updated (using `UPDATE_METHOD`). The default value is `automerge`.\n\n  Note that updating will only happen when the option "Require branches to be\n  up to date before merging" is enabled in the branch protection rules.\n\n  This option can be a comma-separated list of labels, see the `MERGE_LABELS`\n  option for more information.\n\n- `UPDATE_METHOD`: Which method to use when updating the pull request\n  to the base branch. Possible values are `merge` (create a merge commit) or\n  `rebase` (rebase the branch onto the head of the base branch). The default\n  option is `merge`.\n  \n  When the option is `rebase` and the [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)\n  failed, the action will exit with error code 1. This will also be visible\n  in the pull request page, with a message like "this branch has conflicts\n  that must be resolved" and a list of conflicting files.\n\nAlso, the following general options are supported:\n\n- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This should always be `"${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"`.\n  However, in some cases it can be useful to run this action as a certain user\n  (by default, it will run as `github-actions`). This can be useful if you want\n  to use the "Restrict who can push to matching branches" option in the branch\n  protection rules, for example.\n\n  To use this setting for manually providing a token, you need to create a\n  [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)\n  for the user (make sure to check `public_repo` when it\'s a public repository\n  or `repo` when it\'s a private repository). All API requests (merge/rebase)\n  will then be executed as the specified user. The token should be kept secret,\n  so make sure to add it as secret, not as environment variable, in the GitHub\n  workflow file!\n\nYou can configure the environment variables in the workflow file like this:\n\n```yaml\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"\n          MERGE_LABELS: "automerge,!work in progress"\n          MERGE_METHOD: "squash"\n          MERGE_COMMIT_MESSAGE: "pull-request-description"\n          MERGE_FORKS: "false"\n          MERGE_RETRIES: "6"\n          MERGE_RETRY_SLEEP: "10000"\n          UPDATE_LABELS: ""\n          UPDATE_METHOD: "rebase"\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n- When a check from a build tools like Jenkins or CircleCI completes, GitHub\n  triggers the action workflow, but sometimes the pull request state is still\n  pending, blocking the merge. This is [an open issue](https://github.com/pascalgn/automerge-action/issues/7).\n- Currently, there is no way to trigger workflows when the pull request branch\n  becomes out of date with the base branch. There is a request in the\n  [GitHub community forum](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/New-Trigger-is-mergable-state/m-p/36908).\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n'
