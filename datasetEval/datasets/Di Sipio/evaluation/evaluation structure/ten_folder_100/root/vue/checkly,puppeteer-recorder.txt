b'# Puppeteer Recorder\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/checkly/puppeteer-recorder.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/checkly/puppeteer-recorder)\n\n[![coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/UJGejcNli)\n\n![](src/images/recorder.png)\nPuppeteer recorder is a Chrome extension that records your browser interactions and generates a \n[Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) script. Install it from the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/puppeteer-recorder/djeegiggegleadkkbgopoonhjimgehda).\nThis project is pretty fresh, but does the following already:\n\n- Records clicks and type events.\n- Add waitForNavigation, setViewPort and other useful clauses. \n- Generates a Puppeteer script.\n- Shows which events are being recorded.\n- Copy to clipboard.\n- Offers configuration options.\n- Allows data-id configuration for element selection.\n\n> Note: we only record certain events. See `dom-events-to-record.js` in the code-generator folder for which events. This collection will be expanded in future releases.\n\n## Usage\n\n- Click the icon and hit Record.\n- Hit <kbd>tab</kbd> after you finish typing in an `input` element.\n- Click links, inputs and other elements.\n- Wait for full page load on each navigation. The icon will switch from ![](src/images/icon_rec.png) to ![](src/images/icon_wait.png).\n- Click Pause when you want to navigate without recording anything. Hit Resume to continue recording. \n## Background\n\nWriting Puppeteer scripts for scraping, testing and monitoring can be tricky. A recorder / code generator can be helpful,\neven if the code isn\'t perfect. This project builds on other projects (see [disclaimer](#user-content-credits--disclaimer) \nbelow) but adds extensibility, configurability and a smoother UI.\n\n## Development\n\n1. Run: `git clone https://github.com/checkly/puppeteer-recorder.git`\n2. Build the project: `cd puppeteer-recorder && npm i && npm run dev`\n2. Navigate to chrome://extensions\n3. Make sure \'Developer mode\' is checked\n4. Click Load unpacked extension...\n5. Browse to puppeteer-recorder/build and click Select\n\n## Cutting a Release\n\n- bump versions in `package.json` and `manifest.json`\n- tag the code with the version, i.e. `git tag v0.4.0`\n- push with tags `git push --tags`\n\nNow generate a release with **gren**. Make sure all issues associated with the new version are linked to a milestone\nwith the name of the tag.\n\n```\ngren release --override --data-source=milestones --milestone-match="{{tag_name}}"\n```\n\n## Credits & disclaimer\n\nPuppeteer recorder is the spiritual successor & love child of segment.io\'s \n[Daydream](https://github.com/segmentio/daydream) and [ui recorder](https://github.com/yguan/ui-recorder).\n\n## License\nApache 2\n'
