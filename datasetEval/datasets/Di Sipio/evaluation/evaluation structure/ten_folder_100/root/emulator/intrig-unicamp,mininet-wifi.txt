Mininet-WiFi only add wifi features and you can work with it like you were working with Mininet.   \n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intrig-unicamp/mininet-wifi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/intrig-unicamp/mininet-wifi)\n\n### Things to keep in mind when working with Mininet-WiFi   \n* You can use any wireless network tools (e.g. iw, iwconfig, wpa_supplicant, etc)    \n* Please consider computer network troubleshooting steps to solve issues before making questions in the mailing list (e.g. is the station associated with ap? Is the OpenFlow rule working correctly? etc)   \n* Do you need help? Be careful with questions in the mailing list and please providing as much information you can.\n\n### Mailing List  \n[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mininet-wifi-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mininet-wifi-discuss) \n\n### Use Cases Catalogue   \nPlease, let us know if you are doing research with Mininet-WiFi. A list of citations on Mininet-WiFi is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1laEhejMg6th-Urgc-_RqBi2H6m308Rnh9uJpKZavEio/edit?usp=sharing).    \xc2\xa0\n\n## Installation  \n**We highly recommend using Ubuntu version 16.04 or higher. Some new hostapd features might not work on Ubuntu 14.04.**  \nstep 1: $ sudo apt-get install git  \nstep 2: $ git clone https://github.com/intrig-unicamp/mininet-wifi  \nstep 3: $ cd mininet-wifi  \nstep 4: $ sudo util/install.sh -Wlnfv  \n#### install.sh options:   \n-W: wireless dependencies   \n-n: mininet-wifi dependencies    \n-f: OpenFlow   \n-v: OpenvSwitch   \n-l: wmediumd   \noptional:  \n-6: wpan tools\n\n### Building Topologies with GUI\n\n![](https://github.com/ramonfontes/vnd/blob/master/miniedit.png)\n\nI'm a beginner, I do not know Python and I would like to create a customized topology. In this case, both [MiniEdit](https://github.com/intrig-unicamp/mininet-wifi/blob/master/examples/miniedit.py) and [VND](https://github.com/ramonfontes/vnd) can serve as support since they provide a GUI to generate Python scripts. \n\n\n### Development\nFor instructions about easier development check [this helper file](doc/dev_help.md).\n\n## Pre-configured Virtual Machine    \n[Ubuntu 16.04 x64 :: Password: wifi](https://intrig.dca.fee.unicamp.br:8840/owncloud/index.php/s/UfEWT4banmdQuH3)      \nuser: wifi   \npass: wifi   \n   \n## Note\nMininet-WiFi should work fine in any Ubuntu distribution from 14.04, but in some cases (only if you have problems when start it) you have to stop NetworkManager with `stop network-manager` (you can also use `sudo systemctl stop network-manager` or `sudo service network-manager stop`).    \n\n## Book  \nWe are glad to announce that the Mininet-WiFi book has been published!   \n  \nWhile the 1st edition (237 pages) is in Portuguese, affordably available in Printed and E-Book versions, we are about to start to work on the 2nd edition in English. Hard to say when it will be out but we target 2019!   \n\nHere are the pointers to the book:   \n\nPrinted version: https://www.clubedeautores.com.br/livro/emulando-redes-sem-fio-com-mininet-wifi   \n\nPrinted and e-Book version: https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B07QM2BBRF/\n\nGithub repository with all use cases presented in the book:   \nhttps://github.com/ramonfontes/mn-wifi-book-pt   \n\n### Team\nRamon dos Reis Fontes (ramonrf@dca.fee.unicamp.br)  \nChristian Rodolfo Esteve Rothenberg (chesteve@dca.fee.unicamp.br)  \n\nWe are members of [INTRIG (Information & Networking Technologies Research & Innovation Group)](http://intrig.dca.fee.unicamp.br) at University of Campinas - Unicamp, SP, Brazil.\n"
