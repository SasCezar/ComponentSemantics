b"# ipasim\n\n[![Build status](https://img.shields.io/azure-devops/build/ipasim/ipasim/1/master)](https://dev.azure.com/ipasim/ipasim/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)\n[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/ipasimulator/ipasim/total)](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim/releases)\n\nThis repository contains source code of `ipasim`, an iOS emulator for Windows.\nIt takes a compiled iOS application and emulates it. However, only the\napplication's machine code is emulated, whereas system functionality originally\nprovided by iOS is translated to an equivalent functionality available on\nWindows. [More detailed documentation](docs/README.md) is available.\n\n## Project status\n\nCurrently, only simple applications can be emulated. Working samples can be\nfound in folder [`samples`](samples). For more information about (un)implemented\nfeatures, see [author's thesis](docs/thesis/README.md), its *Conclusion* in\nparticular.\n\n## Cloning the repository\n\nWe use [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)\n(recursively), so make sure you clone with `--recurse-submodules`. We also use\n[Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/), so make sure you have that installed if\nyou want to get all files.\n\n## Building and installation\n\nIf you want to use the emulator, you can either [build it from\nsources](docs/build.md) (that's slow), [use partially prebuilt\nartifacts](docs/artifacts.md) (that's fast and recommended if you want to make\nchanges; however, you still need to have Docker and Visual Studio installed) or\njust [use prebuilt binaries](docs/install.md) (recommended if you don't want to\nmake changes).\n\n## Directory structure\n\n- [`deps`](deps) contains third-party dependencies (mostly as Git submodules\n  because patching was necessary).\n- [`docs`](docs) contains [documentation and issues](docs/README.md).\n- [`include`](include) has C++ headers of the project.\n- [`samples`](samples) contains sources of sample iOS applications and some\n  other samples.\n- [`scripts`](scripts) contains various scripts, mostly supporting build of the\n  project.\n- [`src`](src) contains C++ sources of the project.\n  - [HeadersAnalyzer](src/HeadersAnalyzer/README.md) is a tool that runs at\n    compile-time, generating supporting code for the emulator.\n  - [IpaSimulator](src/IpaSimulator/README.md) is the emulator itself.\n  - [objc](src/objc/README.md) contains our port of Apple's Objective-C\n    runtime to Windows.\n\n## Executive summary\n\n[![Poster preview](docs/thesis/poster.png)](docs/thesis/poster.pdf)\n\n## Research\n\n- [iOS emulator for Windows](docs/thesis/README.md), a bachelor thesis of [Jan\n  Jone\xc5\xa1](https://github.com/jjonescz).\n"
