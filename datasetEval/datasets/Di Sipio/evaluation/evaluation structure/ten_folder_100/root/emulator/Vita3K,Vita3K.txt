This is largely dictated by external dependencies, most notably Unicorn.\n\n## Binaries\n\nVita3K binaries for Windows can be downloaded on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Vita3K/vita3k/branch/master/artifacts).\n\n## Building\n### Prerequisites\n[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is used to generate Visual Studio and Xcode project files. It is assumed that you have CMake installed and on your path. Other dependencies are provided as Git submodules or as prebuilt binaries.\n\nAfter cloning, open a command prompt in Vita3K\'s directory and run:\n\n`git submodule update --init --recursive`\n\nto get all submodules.\n\n### Windows (Visual Studio)\n1. Run `gen-windows.bat` to create a `build-windows` directory and generate a Visual Studio solution in there.\n2. Open the `Vita3K.sln` solution.\n3. Set the startup project to `emulator`.\n4. Build.\n\n### macOS (Xcode)\n1. Run `gen-macos.sh` to create a `build-macos` directory and generate an Xcode project in there.\n2. Open the `Vita3K.xcodeproj` project.\n3. When prompted to create schemes, create one for the `emulator` target only. The project builds many targets, so it will make your life easier if you create schemes as needed.\n4. Build.\n\n### Linux\n1. Get [SDL](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation#Linux.2FUnix) (2.0.7+)\n2. `git submodule init && git submodule update`\n3. `gen-linux.sh`\n4. `cd build-linux`\n5. `make`, or `make -jN` where "N" is the amount of cores in your system.\n##### Note: If Unicorn can\'t find Python, use `make UNICORN_QEMU_FLAGS="--python=/usr/bin/python2"` or similar to point it to your installation. `make` works after you do this once.\n\n## Running\nSpecify the path to a .vpk file as the first command line argument, or run `Vita3K --help` from the command-line for a full list of options.\nFor more detailed instructions on running/installing games on all platforms, please read the **#info-faq** channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/MaWhJVH).\n\n## Bugs and issues\nThe project is at an early stage, so please be sensitive to that when opening new issues. Expect crashes, glitches, low compatibility and poor performance.\n\n## Thanks\nThanks go out to people who offered advice or otherwise made this project possible, such as Davee, korruptor, Rinnegatamante, ScHlAuChi, Simon Kilroy, TheFlow, xerpi, xyz, Yifan Lu and many others.\n\n## Donations\nIf you would like to show your appreciation or even help fund development, the project has a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Vita3K) page.\n\n## Supporters\nThank you to the following supporters:\n* Mored1984\n\nIf you support us on Patreon and would like your name added, please get in touch or open a Pull Request.\n\n## Note\nThe purpose of the emulator is not to enable illegal activity.\n\nPlayStation and PS Vita are trademarks of Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc.
