b'# ProjectPSX\n\n![psx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28767885/60985122-30e29900-a33d-11e9-8956-4b933a2745b4.PNG)\n\n**ProjectPSX is a C# coded emulator of the original Sony Playstation (Playstation 1/PS1/PSX)**\n\n*This is a personal project with the scope to learn about hardware and the development of emulators.*\n\nProjectPSX dosn\'t use any external dependency and uses rather simplistic C# code.\n\nAt the moment the following is implemented:\n- CPU (MIPS R3000A) with the Coprocessor 0 and Geometry Transformation Engine (GTE) Coprocessor.\n- A BUS to interconnect the components.\n- GPU with all the commands implemented with a software polygonal rasterizer.\n- Partial CDROM: Implemented the common cd access commands.\n- DMA transfers.\n- Partial TIMERS.\n- Digital controller support (currently hardcoded to keyboard).\n- A basic BIOS and MIPS disassembler.\n- MDEC for video decoding 16bpp and 24bpp.\n- Display Screen with 24bpp support.\n\nWhat is not implemented (but should be...):\n- Fix display to respect the hardware tv output sizes (actually some games can look not correctly centered)\n- CDROM: Proper timmings and a .cue parser.\n- TIMERS: dotclock, h and vsync cases.\n- JOYPAD: Memory Card support.\n\n> **Note:**  A valid PlayStation Bios is needed to run the emulator. SCPH1001.BIN is the default bios on the development but some others like SCPH5501 or SCPH7001 have been reported to work.\n\n## Compability\n\nThe emulator is in very early development and there are constant rewrites. Somehow and although with some limitations there are some games that already "work" like:\nRidge Racer, Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Final Fantasy 7, Crash Bandicoot 1, 2 and 3, Spyro the dragon, Tekken 1 and 3, Toshinden, Time Crisis, Toabal 1 and 2, Vagrant Story, Street Fighter Zero 3, Rockman/Megaman 8/X4, Parasite Eve...\nSome others like Final Fantasy IX, Gran Turismo boot but have random problems to be fixed.\n\n> **Note:**  Memory Card files are unsupported so any progress will be lost upon exit.\n\n\n## Using the emulator\n\nThe emulator should work dragging a BIN iso or a PSX EXE to the GUI.\nYet this is still unimplented and the CD names are hardcoded as strings on the CD Class and the Bios on the Bus Class.\n \nOnce power on, Input is mapped as:\n\n* D-Pad UP: **Up**\n* D-Pad Left: **Left**\n* D-Pad Down: **Down**\n* D-Pad Right: **Right**\n* Triangle: **W**\n* Square: **A**\n* X: **S**\n* Circle: **D**\n* Start: **Enter**\n* Select: **Space**\n* L1: **Q**\n* R1: **E**\n* L2: **1**\n* R2: **2**\n\n## Screenshots\n![cpu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28767885/60985112-304a0280-a33d-11e9-83b3-49a15fb1c117.PNG)\n![gte](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28767885/60985120-30e29900-a33d-11e9-8cfa-1753b878e023.PNG)\n![crash](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28767885/60985114-304a0280-a33d-11e9-80e2-08cd1c5abfbe.PNG)\n![rr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28767885/60985123-30e29900-a33d-11e9-9188-f942e44bcc3a.PNG)\n![ff7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28767885/60985116-304a0280-a33d-11e9-9944-f0dfc4f085c3.PNG)\n![ff7B](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28767885/60985118-304a0280-a33d-11e9-9170-af6902f8bd08.PNG)\n\n## Quick Faq\n- Can i use this emulator to play?\n\nYes you can, but you shouldn\'t. There are a lot of other more capable emulators out there. This is a work in progress personal project with the aim to learn about emulators and hardware implementation. It can and will break during emulation as there are a lot of unimplemented hardware features.\n\n- What\'s up with that window with all the weird colors and the double game screen?\n\nIt\'s the VRAM viewer. It includes all the textures, color lockup tables and displaybuffers used by the playstation software. It\'s used for debugging purposes. You can toggle it by pressing TAB on your keyboard.\n\n- Why "insert game here" doesn\'t work?\n\nProbably due to not implemented hardware or incorrect implemented one, mainly cdrom timmings.\n\n- How can i get console TTY or BIOS output?\n\nUncomment the bios.verbose() or TTY() functions on the CPU main loop. You can also dissasemble() the MIPS CPU instructions and printRegs() on the current opcode.\n\n- Why both RTPS and RTPT Geometry Transformation Engine Coprocessor commands give wrong values on tests?\n\nAt the moment i just use common division where the original PSX uses a fastest, but less accurate division mechanism (based on Unsigned Newton-Raphson (UNR) algorithm.\n\n- Why you did this?\n\nI have been interested in emulating hardware for some time. I started doing a Java [Chip8](https://github.com/BluestormDNA/Chip8) and a C# [Intel 8080 CPU](https://github.com/BluestormDNA/i8080-Space-Invaders) (used on the classic arcade Space Invaders). Some later i did [Nintendo Gameboy](https://github.com/BluestormDNA/ProjectDMG). I wanted to keep forward to do some 3D so i ended with the PSX as it had a good library of games...\n\n- How you did this?\n\nI  mainly used Martin Korth PSX-SPX documentation about the Playstation hardware at https://problemkaputt.de/psx-spx.htm\nAlso the people at the #playstation channel on the emudev discord at https://discord.gg/dkmJAes was very helpful.\n\n- Have you looked at .Net Core 3.0?\n\nYes, there are some fancy features that i would like to play with (Unsafe, Vectors, Ranges...) and of course going multiplarform.\n\n- What about WinForms?\n\nWinforms was the easiest way to have output for me as it was fast prototyped it somehow has lasted more than intended... but the idea is to let it go away in the future.\nI looked at AvaloniaUI but as I said im more focused at the moment on the core aspect and not much (yet) on the UI. The WinForms dependency is very thin and can be easily changed (at some point i used GDI and even SDL). I just wish .Net Core 3.0 had a multiplatform UI as i don\'t like dependencys.\n\n- Tell me more about you!\n\nI\'m just a guy that has a boring job unrelated to coding. I don\'t want to do it for the rest of my life so I started studying to change careers. Eventually learned (a bit) so I code whatever makes me happy. Looking for an internship right now btw...\n\n'
