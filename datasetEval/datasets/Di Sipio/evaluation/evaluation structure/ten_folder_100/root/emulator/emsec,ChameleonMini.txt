b'Chameleon-Mini\n==============\nThis is the official repository of ChameleonMini, a freely programmable, portable tool for NFC security analysis that can emulate and clone contactless cards, read RFID tags and sniff/log RF data. Thanks to over 1700 backers from our [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1980078555/chameleonmini-a-versatile-nfc-card-emulator-and-mo), the current Revision G has been realized by Kasper & Oswald GmbH.\n\nThe ChameleonMini RevG is now also available via the Kasper & Oswald [Webshop](https://shop.kasper.it/). Thank you for supporting the project!\n\nIMPORTANT: Third-party Clones\n------------------\nWe are aware of various third-party ChameleonMini clones or modified variants that are available on the Internet.
