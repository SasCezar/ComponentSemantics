Icons are automatically generated based on the contents of the disk.\n* Tap an hold on a file to delete, rename or share\n* Tap the Edit button to show all files, and the Create Disk Image option\n\nThe disk image menu will attempt to find an icon from the following sources (in\ndescending order of priority):\n\n1. Volume icon (System 7)\n2. Application icon, if the disk contains only one application\n3. Application matching the name of the volume (not the disk image)\n4. Application with name written in the comment field of the volume\n\nIf no icon is found, it will show a standard floppy disk icon.\n\n### Keyboard\n\nSwipe up with two fingers to show the keyboard, and down to hide it.\n\nThe emulated keyboard features all the keys on an Apple Extended keyboard\n(except the Power key). The Command, Option, Control and Shift keys are\nsticky, to make keyboard shortcuts easier to type. You can change the\nappearance of the emulated keyboard in the settings.\n\nIf you have an external keyboard attached, you can use it too, although some\nshortcuts may interfere with iOS.\n\n### Mouse\n\nYou can choose to use the screen as a touchscreen, where tapping on the screen\nacts a mouse click, or as a trackpad. In trackpad mode, dragging is done by\ntapping twice fast and holding it down.\n\nIf you have a jailbroken device and [BTC Mouse & Trackpad](http://www.ringwald.ch/cydia/mouse/),\nMini vMac will use your bluetooth mouse or trackpad.\n\n### Settings\n\nSwipe right with two fingers to show the settings dialog, where you can change\nthe following:\n\n* **Speed:** make the emulated machine faster than a Mac Plus\n* **Mouse Type:** switch between touchscreen and trackpad mode\n* **Keyboard Layout:** change the layout of the emulated keyboard\n* **Emulated Machine:** for changes to take effect, close and relaunch Mini vMac\n\n### Credits\n\n* Mini vMac for iOS by [Jes\xc3\xbas A. \xc3\x81lvarez](https://github.com/zydeco)\n* [Mini vMac](http://gryphel.com/c/minivmac/) \xc2\xa92001-2019 Paul C.
