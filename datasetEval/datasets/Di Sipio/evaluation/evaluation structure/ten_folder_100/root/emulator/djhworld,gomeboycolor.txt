b'gomeboycolor\n============================\n\n**This project is a work in progress and is no way near complete!**\n\nNintendo Gameboy Color emulator\n\nThis is a backend library that provides the core emulator runtime, it is designed to be used in conjuction with a frontend. \n\nAvailable frontends: \n\n* [gomeboycolor-glfw](https://github.com/djhworld/gomeboycolor-glfw) - Uses `libglfw` to provide you a native, windowed version of the emulator.\n* [gomeboycolor-wasm](https://github.com/djhworld/gomeboycolor-wasm) - WebAssembly frontend to support playing in the browser\n* [\\_examples](https://github.com/djhworld/gomeboycolor/tree/master/_examples) - Uses [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) to render the emulator in your terminal.\n\n\nYou are welcome to visit the github page for this project by [clicking here](http://djhworld.github.io/gomeboycolor)\n\nFAQ\n============================\n\n\n### Backend?\n\nThis module will emulate the hardware of the Gameboy Color.\n\nYou can write a \'frontend\' to receive the screen data and render it to a medium of your choosing, along with handling keyboard inputs, and something to handle saving battery saves.\n\nSee the [\\_examples](https://github.com/djhworld/gomeboycolor/tree/master/_examples)  directory for a simple example of how to write a frontend. Alternatively, look at the \'Available frontends\' above.\n\n\n### Features?\n\n* \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f Mostly works. It is not a perfect emulator by any means and some games might not function correctly.\n  * \xe2\x9c\x85 blargg CPU tests pass\n  * \xe2\x9c\x85 blargg memory timing tests pass\n* \xe2\x9c\x85 Supports battery saves for ROMS that allow you to save state\n* \xe2\x9d\x8c Audio is NOT implemented right now\n* \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f  Does not support RTC clock on MBC3 (although games can still be played)\n\n\n### How do I build it?\n\nThis is a \'library\' module, no build required. \n\n\nLicense\n-----------------------------\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2018 Daniel James Harper\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
