b'# Simple 8-bit Assembler Simulator\nA simulator which provides a simplified assembler syntax (based on NASM) and is simulating a x86 like cpu. Press Help inside the simulator to see an overview about the supported instructions.\n\n####<a href="http://schweigi.github.io/assembler-simulator/index.html" target="_blank">TRY IT ONLINE</a>\n\n### Features\n- 8-bit CPU\n- 4 general purpose registers\n- 256 bytes of memory\n- Console output\n\n### How to build\nMake sure you have <a href="http://www.gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> installed to compile the `asmsimulator.js` script.\nRun `grunt` to build the project.\n\n### Background\nA technical introduction is available on my blog: [www.mschweighauser.com](https://www.mschweighauser.com/make-your-own-assembler-simulator-in-javascript-part1/).\n\n### License\n**The MIT License**\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Marco Schweighauser\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
