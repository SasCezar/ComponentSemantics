b'Firebird Emu [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nspire-emus/firebird.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/nspire-emus/firebird) <img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/TE0Bxm8.png">\n==========\n\nThis project is currently the community TI-Nspire emulator, originally created by Goplat.  \nIt supports the emulation of Touchpad, TPad CAS, CX and CX CAS calcs on Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows.\n\nDownload:\n---------\n\n* [Latest release](https://github.com/nspire-emus/firebird/releases/latest)\n\nScreenshots:\n-------------------\n\n_Linux:_\n\n[![](http://i.imgur.com/eGJOMsSl.png)](http://i.imgur.com/eGJOMsS.png)\n\n_Windows:_ | _Android:_\n--- | ---\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/aibTt9Cl.png)](https://i.imgur.com/aibTt9C.png) | [![](https://i.imgur.com/cLphTgnm.png)](https://i.imgur.com/cLphTgn.png)\n_macOS:_ | _iOS:_\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/ymDtYsj.png)](https://i.imgur.com/O8R2aSo.png) | [![](https://i.imgur.com/LT1u2bim.png)](https://i.imgur.com/LT1u2bi.png)\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\nFirst, you need to install Qt5.  \nThen, you can either use Qt Creator directly (don\'t forget to configure your kits/compilers etc.!), or run:\n\n```\nmkdir -p build\ncd build\nqmake ..\nmake\n```\n##### A special case: iOS with translation (\xe2\x89\x88JIT) enabled:\n\nThere seems to be a bug in qmake that makes the required .S get ignored when building a JIT-enabled ([`TRANSLATION_ENABLED = true`](https://github.com/nspire-emus/firebird/blob/master/firebird.pro#L4)) binary.  \nAs a workaround, you\'ll have to take care of it manually:\n\n1. Hit Build in Qt Creator, on an iOS kit/target. (It\'ll fail)\n2. Open the generated .xcodeproj file (in the build folder) in Xcode\n3. Locate `asmcode_arm.S` in the file list, click on it, and in the right sidebar, add it to the Firebird target\n4. Adjust any other project settings as you see fit (certs/profiles/team/signings/entitlements/etc. though this should be automatic except the Team choice)\n5.
