Download it [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).\n    * Make sure to install the 32-bit (x86) version even if you\'re on a 64-bit machine, as the 64-bit build does not include both!\n  * Npcap (Used for Network emulation): Download the Installer [here](https://nmap.org/npcap/#download). Make sure to enable winpcap compatibility mode!\n\n## Automated Builds\nCxbx-Reloaded is not yet ready for general release, but the latest development builds can be downloaded using the links below:\n\n### Development Builds\n* [Latest Development Build](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/SoullessSentinel/cxbx-reloaded/artifacts/Release.zip?branch=develop&job=Configuration:%20Release&pr=false)\n\n* [Full build history](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/SoullessSentinel/cxbx-reloaded/history)\n\n## Compatibility\nCxbx-Reloaded has a [compatibility list](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/game-compatibility/issues).\n\nIf you have something to report on a title, please create or update the issue for it there.\n\nPlease read the [Readme file](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/game-compatibility/blob/master/README.md) first!\n\n## Bug Reports\nGame or software specific issues can be reported in the [compatibility list](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/game-compatibility/issues).\n\nFor emulation issues that are not specific to any single piece of software, a bug report can be submitted at [the Cxbx-Reloaded issue tracker](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/issues).\n\nMake sure bug reports contain:\n* The build tested with, error message displayed (if any)\n* Screenshots \n* Xbe dump (created via [Edit > Dump Xbe Info To > File])\n* Kernel Debug log (created when running a game with [View > Debug Output (Kernel) > File] selected).\n\n## Additional information\nCxbx-Reloaded has a [wiki](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/wiki) containing various subjects and background information.\nChat on [Discord](https://discord.gg/26Xjx23).\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome contributions, large and small.\n\nIf you want to do some coding, be sure to read the [Developer notes](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/wiki/Developer-notes).\n\n**IMPORTANT: Pull-Requests containing code derived from XQEMU will _not_ be approved until an agreement is reached to make work mutually beneficial. this includes updates to existing xqemu derived code. We should not/will not become a hostile fork.**\n\nPlease contact us before you start working on something, so we can make sure your work is going to be accepted once finished.\n\n### Main Prerequisites\n1. [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/)\n2. [CMake](https://cmake.org/)\n   * **REMARK:** Some IDEs already have CMake support, so this is optional.\n\n### Fetching the code\nRun the following command on the command line:\n`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/`\n\nPlease note the `--recurse-submodules` parameter. This is required to fetch sub-modules.\n\nWithout this, Cxbx-Reloaded will fail to build.\n\nIf Cxbx-Reloaded was previously checked out without the submodules, they can be updated/fetched with the following command:\n`git submodule update --init --recursive`\n\n### Compiling\nPlease note that Debug builds are significantly slower, but may help diagnose a problematic title.\n\n## Windows\n**NOTE:** It\'s not recommended to open CMakeLists.txt from Visual Studio, as it won\'t generate files in the build directory.\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) or 2017\n   * Both C++ and C# desktop development\n   * Windows Universal CRT SDK\n   * C++ CMake tools for Windows **(optional if CMake is installed on system)**\n2. [Microsoft Child Process Debugging Power Tool](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GreggMiskelly.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool)\n\n### Create Visual Studio generator files\n1. Open "___ Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 20__" from Start Menu.\n   * Ignore this step if you have CMake installed on your system.\n2. Navigate to downloaded Cxbx-Reloaded repo\'s directory as current working directory.\n3. Then run these commands.\n   1. `mkdir build & cd build` - Requirement to create and go in the build directory.\n      * **REMARK:** You can use `build-x86` as your preferred directory as well.\n   2. `cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32` - Create generated files for Visual Studio 2019.\n      * Or use `"Visual Studio 15 2017"` for Visual Studio 2017.\n        * **REMARK:** CMake 1.14 or later is the requirement to support Visual Studio 2019 generator.\n          * Visual Studio **16.1** 2019 or later has CMake 1.14 bundled.\n4. Open `Cxbx-Reloaded.sln` from build-x86 directory, select your configuration (Release or Debug), then hit Build.\n\n## Linux / macOS\nCurrently not supported yet.\n\n## Support\nYou can support [Luke Usher](https://github.com/LukeUsher), initiator of Cxbx-Reloaded, on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/LukeUsher).\n\n## Special Thanks\n* All contributors to the original Cxbx and [Dxbx](https://github.com/PatrickvL/Dxbx) projects. Without them Cxbx-Reloaded would not exist at all.\n* [XQEMU](https://github.com/xqemu/xqemu) - While the majority of Cxbx-R is our own work (Kernel, HLE, etc), the NV2A LLE implementation and NVNet implementation are primarily the work of the XQEMU developers.\n* [XboxDev](https://github.com/xboxdev/) - Providing Xbox Hardware Research & Useful Tooling\n'
