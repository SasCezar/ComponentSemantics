Expect bugs.**\n\n[1.0 Roadmap Tracking Issue](https://github.com/torch2424/wasmBoy/issues/197)\n\nSimply install through npm:\n\n`npm install --save wasmboy`\n\nDocumentation for the project can be found on the [WasmBoy Wiki](https://github.com/torch2424/wasmBoy/wiki).\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\nTry to test and aim for support on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari). Also, Node support works with the [`headless` option in the WasmBoy config](https://github.com/torch2424/wasmBoy/wiki/Lib-API#wasmboyoptions), and using the [Worker Threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html) `--experimental-worker` flag.\n\n# In-Game Screenshots\n\n### Gameboy Support\n\n![Is that a demo in your pocket](./docs/images/wasmBoyIsThatADemoInYourPocket.png) ![Megaman 2](./docs/images/wasmBoyMegaman2.png) ![Pokemon Blue](./docs/images/wasmBoyPokemonBlue.png) ![tetris](./docs/images/wasmBoyTetris.png) ![tobu tobu girl](./test/performance/testroms/tobutobugirl/tobutobugirl.gb.noPerformanceOptions.png)\n\n### Gameboy Color Support\n\n![Links Awakening](./docs/images/wasmBoyLinksAwakening.png) ![L s d j](./docs/images/wasmBoyLsdj.png) ![Megaman extreme 2](./docs/images/wasmBoyMegamanXtreme2.png) ![Pokemon Silver](./docs/images/wasmBoyPokemonSilver.png) ![Pokemon Yellow](./docs/images/wasmBoyPokemonYellow.png) ![back to color demo](./test/performance/testroms/back-to-color/back-to-color.gbc.noPerformanceOptions.png)\n\n# Demo Applications\n\n### Debugger\n\n[Application Link](https://wasmboy.app/)\n\nA full debugger meant for analyzing the internals of the gameboy. Great for HomeBrew Gameboy Development, or using as a reference point for building your own GameBoy emulator. **See the gif at the top of the README for an example.**\n\n**Features**\n\n- Support of all Gameboy Components: CPU, PPU (Graphics), APU (Audio), Memory, Interrupts, and Timers. \xf0\x9f\x8e\xae\n- Per cycle state of each Game Boy components data, internal registers, and relevant memory addresses. \xf0\x9f\x8c\x90\n- Loaded ROM Information and parsing of the [Cartridge Header](http://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/The_Cartridge_Header). \xf0\x9f\x92\xbe\n- CPU Control options. Stepping per opcode, and breakpoints. \xf0\x9f\xa7\xa0\n- Graphics Background Map, with border for current "camera" location with respect to scroll registers. \xf0\x9f\x96\xbc\xef\xb8\x8f\n- Graphics Tile Data, to display the loaded tiles currently loaded across all VRAM Banks. \xf0\x9f\x8e\xa8\n- WasmBoy Control options. Play, Pause, Save State, and Load State. \xe2\x8f\xaf\xef\xb8\x8f \xf0\x9f\x93\x9a\n- Ability to log the entire WasmBoy Library Object and Memory to the DevTools Console. \xf0\x9f\x96\xa5\xef\xb8\x8f\n- Highly productive "Docker" layout, with snapping of widgets onto sections of the screen and tab support. \xe2\x9a\x93\n- Saved Layouts between sessions. \xf0\x9f\x92\xa0\n- Help widget with tips on how to be effective in the debugger. \xf0\x9f\x99\x8b\n\n**Anaytics / Privacy**\n\n[Analytics Wrapper Service](./demo/debugger/analytics.js)\n\nAnalytics is used on this application simply for performance monitoring, and tracking popularity of the applications. The following events are sent, with nothing more than the event name. The analytics provider used is [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/).\n\n- Whenever a new ROM is loaded, and played for the first time.\n- Whether attempting to load a ROM was successful.\n- Whenever a state is saved.\n- Whenever a state is loaded.\n- Whenever custom WasmBoy options are applied.\n- Whenever the Google Drive option is selected.\n- Whenever the mobile demo is manually reloaded.\n\n**Mobile Demo**\n\nFor UI/UX reasons, on mobile the debugger is simply a web app for testing the lib. This is useful for testing a ROM on the go. For playing games, I would suggest [VaporBoy](https://vaporboy.net/). Below is an example of the mobile demo:\n\n![Pokemon Crystal Wasmboy Mobile Demo](./docs/images/debuggerMobileDemo.gif)\n\n### Benchmark\n\n[Application Link](https://wasmboy.app/benchmark/)\n\n[Medium Article](https://medium.com/@torch2424/webassembly-is-fast-a-real-world-benchmark-of-webassembly-vs-es6-d85a23f8e193)\n\nSince WasmBoy is built in AssemblyScript, it can also run it\'s core through the Typescript compiler if we mock out some of the WebAssembly interface. The benchmarking tool was built as a way to compare WebAssembly performance to Javascript / ES6 performance, after compiling the core to both WebAssembly and Javascript. It includes detailed stats, live running output, and multiple graphs. Also great for comparing the performance of devices that run WasmBoy.\n\n**Anaytics / Privacy**\n\nAnalytics is used on this application simply for performance monitoring, and tracking popularity of the application. The following events are sent, with nothing more than the event name. The analytics provider used is [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/).\n\n- Whenever a new ROM is loaded from the particular source.\n- Whenever the benchmark is ran.\n- Whenever results are rendered for the benchmark.\n\n**Example**\n\n![WasmBoy Benchmark Runner Section on Safari](./docs/images/benchmarkSafariBackToColorRunner.png)\n\n# Tests\n\nThese are all currently known passing tests (by me), there may be more test roms out there that pass. Some tests may not pass, and that can either be because of the component it is testing is actually incorrect, or another component that the test is testing is not yet implemented, or is incorrect (e.g a lot of mooneye tests rely on Serial Interrupts, which this emulator has yet to implement). Feel free to open an issue or PR to add any more passing tests to this list \xf0\x9f\x98\x84 . **The test names are listed from left to right, top to bottom**.\n\n### Blarrg\n\n[Repo with all blargg\'s tests and source](https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms)\n\ncpu_instrs, instr_timing, mem_timing, mem_timing-2, halt_bug, cgb_sound\n\n![Cpu Instructions all tests passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/blargg/cpu_instrs/cpu_instrs.golden.png)\n![Instruction timing all tests passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/blargg/instr_timing/instr_timing.golden.png)\n![Memory timing all tests passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/blargg/mem_timing/mem_timing.golden.png)\n![Memory timing 2 all tests passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/blargg/mem_timing-2/mem_timing-2.golden.png)\n![halt bug all tests passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/blargg/halt_bug/halt_bug.golden.png)\n![cgb sound all tests passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/blargg/cgb_sound/cgb_sound.golden.png)\n\n### Mooneye\n\n[Mooneye GB Emulator / Tests](https://github.com/Gekkio/mooneye-gb)\n\n#### Timing\n\ndiv_write, rapid_toggle, tim00, tim00_div_trigger, tim01, tim01_div_trigger, tim10, tim10_div_trigger, tim11, tim11_div_trigger, tima_reload, tima_write_reloading, tma_write_reloading\n\n![div write test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/div_write/div_write.golden.png)\n![rapid toggle test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/rapid_toggle/rapid_toggle.golden.png)\n![tim00 test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/tim00/tim00.golden.png)\n![tim00 div trigger test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/tim00_div_trigger/tim00_div_trigger.golden.png)\n![tim01 test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/tim01/tim01.golden.png)\n![tim01 div trigger test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/tim01_div_trigger/tim01_div_trigger.golden.png)\n![tim10 test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/tim10/tim10.golden.png)\n![tim10 div trigger test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/tim10_div_trigger/tim10_div_trigger.golden.png)\n![tim11 test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/tim11/tim11.golden.png)\n![tim11 div trigger test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/tim11_div_trigger/tim11_div_trigger.golden.png)\n![tima reload test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/tima_reload/tima_reload.golden.png)\n![tima write reloading test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/tima_write_reloading/tima_write_reloading.golden.png)\n![tma write reloading test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/timer/tma_write_reloading/tma_write_reloading.golden.png)\n\n#### Halt\n\nhalt_ime0_ei, halt_ime0_nointr_timing, halt_ime1_timing\n\n![halt_ime0_ei test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/halt/halt_ime0_ei/halt_ime0_ei.golden.png)\n![halt_ime0_nointr_timing test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/halt/halt_ime0_nointr_timing/halt_ime0_nointr_timing.golden.png)\n![halt_ime1_timing test passing](./test/accuracy/testroms/mooneye/halt/halt_ime1_timing/halt_ime1_timing.golden.png)\n\n# Contributing\n\nFeel free to fork and submit PRs! Opening an issue is reccomended before starting any development, as a discussion would be nice on the idea / feature before writing code. Any help is much appreciated, and would be a ton of fun!\n\n### Installation\n\nJust your standard node app. Install Node with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), `git clone` the project, and `npm install`, and you should be good to go!\n\n### CLI Commands / Npm Scripts\n\nThe project contains three different elements.\n\n- The `core` or `wasm` which is the web assembly module for wasmboy written in [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript).\n- The `lib` which is the importable library of wasmboy that can be used in other projects, that adds a top level API to the `core`.\n- The `demo`, which is a collection of different apps that are used for demoing purposes of the `lib` and `core`.\n\nMost of the build process in this project is done using [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en). Each element / component of the project is configured in its own `rollup.*.js` file, and are then all used within the standard `rollup.config.js` file by the rollup CLI. Also, The `core` wasm uses the [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) compiler CLI tool.\n\nCommands for each part of the project will be prepended with their element name and a colon, e.g `debugger:[command here]`.\n\nCommon command parts are:\n\n- `dev` / `watch` - How the project should be served and developed with tools like reloading.\n- `build` - Make production builds of the component / element of the project.\n\nCommands not prepended with a colon are meant for easily building on all of the different parts as a whole.\n\nNot all commands are documented, only ones relevant to making changes to the library for contributions. `*` represents the category of commands, and is not an actual command.\n\n```bash\n# Command to serve the project, and watch the debugger, wasm, and lib for changes\n# Uses concurrently: https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently\n# Concurrently helps cleanup the output and organizes watchers on commands that require concurrent tools\n\n# Serve the general project for development (Watches the core, lib, and debugger)\nnpm run start\n\n# Same as npm start\nnpm run dev\n\n# Same as npm start\nnpm run watch\n\n# Build everything to be ready to be pushed to npm or released\nnpm run build\n\n# Linting commands used during precommit an tests\nnpm run prettier:*\n\n# Commands for building/serving the core, offers commands for building with the Assemblyscript Compiler (WASM) or Typescript (JS)\nnpm run core:*\n\n# Commands for building/serving the JS lib\nnpm run lib:*\n\n# Run tests in `test/accuracy/test.js`\nnpm run test\n\n# Run tests in `test/performance/test.js`\nnpm run test:performance\n\n# All commands for testing, and are test related\nnpm run test:*\n\n# Commands for the building / serving the debugger\nnpm run debugger:*\n\n# Commands for building / serving the benchmark tool\nnpm run benchmark:*\n\n# Commands for building / serving all available apps in wasmboy\nnpm run demo:*\n```\n\nUsing the [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) for debugger/demo deployment onto gh-pages.\n\n# Notable Projects\n\n- [VaporBoy](https://github.com/torch2424/vaporBoy) - PWA for playing ROMs with WasmBoy!\n\n- [wasmboy-rs](https://github.com/CryZe/wasmboy-rs) - Wasmboy Compiled to Rust, for native executables and additional cool features!\n\n- [wasmboy.py](https://bitbucket.org/windel/ppci/src/default/examples/wasm/wasmboy.py?fileviewer=file-view-default) - Wasmboy running in Python!\n\n# Special Thanks\n\n- [awesome gb-dev communitty](https://github.com/avivace/awesome-gbdev), too many rad dudes to name!\n\n- [dcodeIO for building and fixing bugs with AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript).
