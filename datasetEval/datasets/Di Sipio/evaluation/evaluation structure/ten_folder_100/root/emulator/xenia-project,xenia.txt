When writing code, check the [style guide](docs/style_guide.md)\nand be sure to run clang-format!\n\n## Contributors Wanted!\n\nHave some spare time, know advanced C++, and want to write an emulator?\nContribute! There\'s a ton of work that needs to be done, a lot of which\nis wide open greenfield fun.\n\n**For general rules and guidelines please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\n\nFixes and optimizations are always welcome (please!), but in addition to\nthat there are some major work areas still untouched:\n\n* Help work through [missing functionality/bugs in games](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/labels/compat)\n* Add input drivers for [DualShock4 (PS4) controllers](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/issues/60) (or anything else)\n* Skilled with Linux?
