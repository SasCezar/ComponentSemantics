It includes a set of open source SDKs, tools, and services which enable developers to **build**, **test**, and **connect** bots that interact naturally with users, wherever they are. With the Microsoft Bot Framework, it is easy to create a bot with the ability to speak, listen, understand, and learn from your users with Azure Cognitive Services. \r\n\r\n![Bot Framework](./docs/media/Bot-Framework-header.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis repo lists the SDK, tools, and services needed to build a great conversational AI experience. Its role is to serve as a landing page and one place to find all the information required to get started. \r\n\r\n- [Bot Framework Composer](#Bot-Framework-Composer)\r\n- [Bot Framework SDK v4](#Bot-Framework-SDK-v4)\r\n- [Bot Framework Solutions](#Bot-Framework-Solutions)\r\n- [Azure Bot Service](#Azure-Bot-Service)\r\n- [Bot Framework Emulator](#Bot-Framework-Emulator)\r\n- [Bot Framework Web Chat](#Bot-Framework-Web-Chat)\r\n- [Bot Framework Tools](#Bot-Framework-CLI-Tools)\r\n- [Language Understanding](#Language-Understanding)\r\n- [QnA Maker](#QnA-Maker)\r\n- [Dispatch](#Dispatch)\r\n- [Speech Services](#Speech-Services)  \r\n- [Adaptive cards](#Adaptive-Cards)\r\n- [Analytics](#Analytics)\r\n- [Bot Framework SDK v3](#Bot-Framework-SDK-v3)\r\n\r\n## Bot Framework Composer\r\n[Bot Framework Composer (Preview)](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Composer/blob/stable/README.md) is an integrated development tool for developers and multi-disciplinary teams to build bots and conversational experiences with the Microsoft Bot Framework. Within this tool, you\'ll find everything you need to build a sophisticated conversational experience.\r\n\r\n## Bot Framework SDK v4\r\nThe Bot Framework SDK v4 is an [open source SDK][1a] that enable developers to model and build sophisticated conversation using their favorite programming language.\r\n\r\n\r\n|   | C#  | JS  | Python |  Java | \r\n|---|:---:|:---:|:------:|:-----:|\r\n|Stable Release |[4.6][1] | [4.6][2] | [Beta 4][3] | [Preview 3][3a]|\r\n|Docs | [docs][5] |[docs][5] |  | |\r\n|Samples |[.NET Core][6], [WebAPI][10] |[Node.js][7] , [TypeScript][8], [es6][9]  | | | \r\n\r\n[1a]:https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/#readme\r\n[1]:https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/#packages\r\n[2]:https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js#packages\r\n[3]:https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python#packages\r\n[3a]:https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java#packages\r\n[4]:https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java#packages\r\n[5]:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0\r\n[6]:https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/csharp_dotnetcore\r\n[7]:https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/javascript_nodejs\r\n[8]:https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/typescript_nodejs\r\n[9]:https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/javascript_es6\r\n[10]:https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/csharp_webapi\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name="V4-whats-new"></a>\r\n\r\n### Bot Framework SDK v4 - (Preview)\r\n\r\n- **Adaptive Dialogs** enable developers to build conversations that can be dynamically changed as the conversation progresses.  Traditionally developers have mapped out the entire flow of a conversation up front, which limits the flexibility of the conversation.  Adaptive dialogs allow them to be more flexible, to respond to changes in context and insert new steps or entire sub-dialogs into the conversation as it progresses. Additionally as with other SDK V4 concepts, we have defined adaptive dialogs such that they can be defined via [declarative][50] that are interpreted at runtime; which allows us to have tooling on top of this and integrate with services. [[Docs][48] | [C# samples][49]]\r\n\r\n- **Language Generation**: Learning from our customers\' experiences and bringing together capabilities first implemented by Cortana and Cognition teams, we are introducing Language Generation. It allows the developer to extract the embedded strings from their code and resource files and manage them through a Language Generation runtime and file format.  Language Generation enable customers to define multiple variations on a phrase, execute simple expressions based on context, refer to conversational memory, and over time will enable us to bring additional capabilities all leading to a more natural conversational experience. [[Docs][44] | [C# samples][45]]\r\n\r\n- **Common Expression Language**: Both Adaptive dialogs and Language Generation rely on and use a common expression language to power bot conversations.
