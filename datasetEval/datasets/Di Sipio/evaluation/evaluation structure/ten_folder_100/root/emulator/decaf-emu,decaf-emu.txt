Licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later (GPLv3+).\n\nYou can find us for developer discussion:\n- on discord using https://discord.gg/tPqFBnr\n- or at #wiiu-emu on freenode.\n\n## Requirements\n- Windows with the latest update of Visual Studio 2017\n- Linux with a modern C++17 friendly compiler\n- 64 bit\n- CMake v3.2+\n- OpenGL 4.5+ or Vulkan 1.1.92.1+\n\n## Support\n- None, this is an in-development project and user support is not provided.\n\n## Binaries\nThe latest Windows binaries are available via [Actions artifacts](https://github.com/decaf-emu/decaf-emu/actions).\n\n## Running\n\n`./decaf-sdl play <path to game>`\n\nIt is recommended to run the emulator from the root git directory so that it is able to access `resources/fonts/*`.  Alternatively, set `resources_path` in the configuration file to point to the resources directory.\n\nConfiguration files can be found at:\n- Windows - `%APPDATA%\\decaf`\n- Linux - `~/.config/decaf`\n\nOn Linux, a "Bus error" crash usually indicates an out-of-space error in the temporary directory.  Set the `TMPDIR` environment variable to a directory on a filesystem with at least 2GB free.\n\n## Building from Source\n\nSee [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md)\n'
