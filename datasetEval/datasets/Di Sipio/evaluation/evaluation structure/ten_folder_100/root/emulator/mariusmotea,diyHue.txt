b'# [MOVED TO DIYHUE ORGANISATION](https://github.com/diyhue)\n\n**Please only open new issues at [diyhue/diyHue](https://github.com/diyhue/diyHue)**\n\nThis project has rapidly grown in size and has therefore moved to it\'s own organisation [diyhue](https://github.com/diyhue) Don\'t worry though, this is not the end of the project, just the next step in its development. It has also grown enough that we have split the repo into four so each can focus on it\'s own subject, be that the main code, diy Lights or sensors and controllers. You can find the new diy organisation and its repos [here](https://github.com/diyhue)!\n\nTo migrate your existing install to the new repo please run the following command from the diyHue install directory. This is /opt/hue-emultaor if you used the easy install script:\n```\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mariusmotea/diyHue/master/migrate.sh | sudo bash /dev/stdin\n```\nIf your using docker, please just pull the latest image.\n\nThank you for your support. :smile:\n\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3%2FApache%202.0%2FCC%20BY--SA%204.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/mariusmotea/diyHue/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\n[![CommitActivity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/y/mariusmotea/diyhue.svg)](https://github.com/mariusmotea/diyHue/commits/master)\n[![ZenHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZenHubIO/support/master/zenhub-badge.png)](https://zenhub.com)\n\n[![JoinSlack](https://img.shields.io/badge/Join%20us-on%20Slack-green.svg)](https://slackinvite.squishedmooo.com/) [![SlackStatus](https://slackinvite.squishedmooo.com/badge.svg?colorB=8ebc06)](https://slackinvite.squishedmooo.com/)\n\n[![TravisCI](https://api.travis-ci.com/mariusmotea/diyHue.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mariusmotea/diyHue)\n[![DockerPulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/diyhue/core.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/diyhue/core/)\n\n[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/diyhue/core:arm.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/diyhue/core:arm "Get your own version badge on microbadger.com")\n[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/diyhue/core:arm.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/diyhue/core:arm "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")\n\n[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/diyhue/core:amd64.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/diyhue/core:amd64 "Get your own version badge on microbadger.com")\n[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/diyhue/core:amd64.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/diyhue/core:amd64 "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")\n\nThis project emulates a Philips Hue Bridge that is able to control ZigBee lights (using Raspbee module, original Hue Bridge or IKEA Tradfri Gateway), Mi-Light bulbs (using MiLight Hub), Neopixel strips (WS2812B and SK6812) and any cheap ESP8266 based bulb  by replacing the firmware with a custom one. It is written in python and will run on all small devices such as the RaspberryPi. Arduino sketches are provided for the Hue Dimmer Switch, Hue Tap Switch and Hue Motion Sensor. Lights are two-way synchronized so any change made from original Philips/Tradfri sensors and switches will also be applied to the bridge emulator.\n\n![diyHue ecosystem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mariusmotea/diyHue/develop/Images/hue-map.png)\n\n\n### Requirements:\n - python 3\n - nmap package for esp8266 lights autodiscover ```sudo apt install nmap```\n - python ws4py package only if zigbee module is used ```sudo pip install ws4py```\n\n\n## To Do\n - ~~Working directly with ZigBee lights, switches and sensors with RaspBee module~~\n - ~~control IKEA Tr\xc3\xa5dfri lights from HUE applications~~\n - ~~Create ESP8266 bridge device to add MI Lights to Hue Bridge emulator.~~\n - ~~On/Off control for other home devices using virtual lights~~\n - Alarm (~~email notification~~ + eps8266 horn)\n - ~~Hue Entertainment support~~\n\n## Working HUE futures:\n  - Control lights (all functions)\n  - Control groups (all functions)\n  - Scenes (all functions)\n  - Routines\n  - Wake up\n  - Go to sleep\n  - Switches (custom esp8266 switches)\n  - Autodiscover lights\n  - Hue entertainment\n  \n## Working devices and applications:\n  - Amazon Alexa (control only the lights)\n  - Logitech Harmony\n  - Tradfri Gateway\n  - Hue Bridge (original + other emulators)\n  - Home Assistant\n  - Domoticz\n  - Openhab\n  - Philips Ambilight TV\'s \n  - Kodi Hue Ambilight\n  - Jeedom\n  - Hue Sync for PC\n \n ## Working smartphone applications:\n  - Hue (official application)\n  - [Hue Essentials](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.superthomaslab.hueessentials) - recommended\n  - hueManic\n  - OnSwitch\n  - HueSwitcher\n  - LampShade\n\n## Not working:\n  - Home & Away future from Hue app (require remote api)\n  - Google Home (require remote api)\n  - Eneco Toon (very likely it use cloud service detection)\n  \n## Supported lights:\n  - WS2812B and SK6812 smart led strips\n  - MiLight\n  - Yeelight\n  - LYT8266\n  - Phillips Hue\n  - Ikea Tradfri\n  - Pwm RGB-CCT\n  - Pwm RGBW\n  - Pwm RGB\n  - Pwm CCT\n  - Pwm Dimming (up to 6 lights for every esp8266)\n  - On/Off plugs/lights (up to 6 lights for every esp8266)\n  - On/Off 433Mhz devices (multiple devices for every esp8266)\n  \n## Stability:\nAll the lights in my house are controlled by this solution so the stability is very important to me as there is no turning back to classic illumination (all switches were replaces with Ikea Tradfri Remotes and holes covered). However I don\'t use all the functions, so i\'m unable to perform full tests on every change. What I do currently use is Deconz with all Tradfri devices (lights + sensors), Xiaomi Motion Sensor, native ESP8266 bulbs, ESP8266 + WS2812B strips and Xiaomi YeeLight color bulb.\n  \nPlease submit [ in this issue](https://github.com/mariusmotea/diyHue/issues/27) or on our [slack team](https://slackinvite.squishedmooo.com/) any other device/application that is working with this emulator.\n  \nCheck the [Wiki page](https://github.com/mariusmotea/diyHue/wiki) for more details  \n  \n[![Youtube Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/c6MsG3oIehY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6MsG3oIehY)\n\nI push updates fast so if you want to be notified, just watch this repo\n\nContributions are welcome \n\nHue living color light project for 3D printing: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2773413\n\n## qtHue\nYou may want to see also my new project [qtHue](https://github.com/mariusmotea/qtHue) that provide a simple user interface for controlling the lights.\n![qtHue](https://github.com/mariusmotea/qtHue/blob/master/Screenshot.png?raw=true)\n\nCredits:\n  - [@avinashraja98](https://github.com/avinashraja98) - Hue Entertainment server\n  - Federico Zivolo ([@FezVrasta](https://github.com/FezVrasta)) Internal WebGUI\n  - [@J3n50m4t](https://github.com/J3n50m4t) - Yeelight integration\n  - Martin \xc4\x8cern\xc3\xbd ([@mcer12](https://github.com/mcer12)) - Yeelight color bulb\n  - probonopd https://github.com/probonopd/ESP8266HueEmulator\n  - sidoh https://github.com/sidoh/esp8266_milight_hub\n  - StefanBruens https://github.com/StefanBruens/ESP8266_new_pwm\n  - C\xc3\xa9dric @ticed35 for linkbutton implementation\n  - [@cheesemarathon](https://github.com/cheesemarathon) - Help with Docker images\n  - [@Mevel](https://github.com/Mevel) - 433Mhz devices\n  - [@Nikfinn99](https://github.com/Nikfinn99) - PCB designs\n'
