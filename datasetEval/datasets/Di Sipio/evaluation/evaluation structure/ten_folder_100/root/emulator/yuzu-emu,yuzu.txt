b"yuzu emulator\n=============\n[![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yuzu-emu/yuzu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yuzu-emu/yuzu)\n[![Azure Mainline CI Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/_apis/build/status/yuzu%20mainline?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/)\n\nyuzu is an experimental open-source emulator for the Nintendo Switch from the creators of [Citra](https://citra-emu.org/).\n\nIt is written in C++ with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows and Linux. The emulator is capable of running several commercial games.\n\nyuzu only emulates a subset of Switch hardware and therefore most commercial games **do not** run at full speed or are not fully functional.\n\nDo you want to check which games are compatible and which ones are not? Please visit our [Compatibility page](https://yuzu-emu.org/game/)!\n\nyuzu is licensed under the GPLv2 (or any later version). Refer to the license.txt file included.\n\nCheck out our [website](https://yuzu-emu.org/)!\n\nFor development discussion, please join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XQV6dn9).\n\n### Development\n\nMost of the development happens on GitHub. It's also where [our central repository](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu) is hosted.\n\nIf you want to contribute please take a look at the [Contributor's Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Developer Information](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/wiki/Developer-Information). You should as well contact any of the developers on Discord in order to know about the current state of the emulator.\n\n### Building\n\n* __Windows__: [Windows Build](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/wiki/Building-For-Windows)\n* __Linux__: [Linux Build](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/wiki/Building-For-Linux)\n* __macOS__: [macOS Build](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/wiki/Building-for-macOS)\n\n\n### Support\nWe happily accept monetary donations or donated games and hardware.
