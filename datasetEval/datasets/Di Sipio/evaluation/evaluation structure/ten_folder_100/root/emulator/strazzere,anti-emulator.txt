b'anti-emulator\n=============\n\nAndroid Anti-Emulator, originally presented at HitCon 2013: "Dex Education 201: Anti-Emulation"\n\nPurpose of this project was intended to show various ways of detecting an emulated Android environment. Some of the methods are adapted from previously seen malware on other operating systems, others are just random thoughts. Slowly over time things have been added that I\'ve either thought of randomly, stumbled upon or came across in the wild. I\'ll do my best to comment if anything from the wild is added directly to the project, as this would likely be more interesting to AV/researchers attempting to hide their own sandboxes.\n\nContents\n--------\n\n - slides/ - Talk slides\n - AntiEmulation/ - Eclipse project and main source of anti* code\n\nDisclaimer\n----------\n\nThis presentation and code are meant for education and research purposes only. Do as you please with it, but accept any and all responsibility for your actions. The tools were created specifically to assist in malware reversing and analysis - be careful.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n    Copyright 2014-19 Tim \'diff\' Strazzere <strazz@gmail.com>\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n'
