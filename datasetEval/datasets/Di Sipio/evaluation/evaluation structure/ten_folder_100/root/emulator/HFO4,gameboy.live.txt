b'# Gameboy.Live\n\xf0\x9f\x95\xb9\xef\xb8\x8f `Gameboy.Live` is a Gameboy emulator written in go for learning purposes. You can simply play Gameboy games on your desktop:\n\n![https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live/raw/master/doc/screenshot.png](https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live/raw/master/doc/screenshot.png)\n\nOr, "Cloud Game" in your terminal with a single command:\n\n```\ntelnet gameboy.live 1989\n```\n\n![https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live/raw/master/doc/cloud-gaming.gif](https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live/raw/master/doc/cloud-gaming.gif)\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can directly download the executable file from the [Release](https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live/releases) page, or build it from the source. Go Version 1.11 or higher is required. Run `go version` to check what the version currently installed is. On Debian based systems, the packages `libasound2-dev` and `libgl1-mesa-dev` must be installed.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live.git\ncd gameboy.live\ngo build -o gbdotlive main.go\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nUsage of gbdotlive:\n  -G    Play specific game in Fyne GUI mode\n  -c config\n        Set the game option list config file path\n  -d    Use Debugger in GUI mode\n  -f FPS\n        Set the FPS in GUI mode (default 60)\n  -g    Play specific game in GUI mode (default true)\n  -h    This help\n  -m    Turn on sound in GUI mode (default true)\n  -p port\n        Set the port for the cloud-gaming server (default 1989)\n  -r ROM\n        Set ROM file path to be played in GUI mode\n  -s    Start a cloud-gaming server\n```\n\n### GUI mode\n\nPlay a specified ROM file in GUI mode:\n\n```\ngbdotlive -G -r "Tetris.gb" \n```\n\n### Set up a Cloud Gaming server\n\nYou can use `Gameboy.Live` as a "Cloud Gaming" server, where players use telnet to play Gameboy games in terminal without additional software installation required. (Except telnet itself xD)\n\nA `gamelist.json` config file is required to specify game options. This is a typical example:\n\n```json\n[{\n\t"Title": "Tetris",\n\t"Path": "test.gb"\n}, {\n\t"Title": "Dr. Mario",\n\t"Path": "Dr. Mario (JU) (V1.1).gb"\n}, {\n\t"Title": "Legend of Zelda - Link\'s Awakening",\n\t"Path": "Legend of Zelda, The - Link\'s Awakening (U) (V1.2) [!].gb"\n}]\n\n```\n\nIt is recommended to test every ROM before putting them in the config file.\n\nNext, start a `Gameboy.Live` server with the config file from the previous step:\n\n```\ngbdotlive -s -c "gamelist.json"\n```\n\nYou will see an output like this, which means your server has started successfully:\n\n```\n2019/04/30 21:27:56 Listen port: 1989 \n```\n\nNow, you can play games anywhere you want! The simulation and rendering process is done entirely on the server.\n\n```\ntelnet <ip of your server>:<port>\n```\n\n"Cloud Gaming" is only supported in terminals which support standard [ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) and the UTF-8 charset. You can use `WSL` instead of `CMD` on Windows.\n\n### Debug\n\n`Gameboy.Live` has a simple built-in debugger. To turn on debug mode, set the `d` flag to `true`:\n\n```\ngbdotlive -r "test.gb" -d=true\n```\n\nThe emulator will firstly break at the ROM entry point `0x0100` in debug mode, which is the entry point of the game program. You can type the address of next breakpoint. The emulator will continue to run until the next breakpoint is reached. At each breakpoint, the emulator will print the register\'s contents like above and dump the main memory into `memory.dump` (ROM and RAM bank not included)\n\n```\n[OP:NOP]\nAF:01B0  BC:0013  DE:00D8  HL:014D  SP:FFFE   \nPC:0100  LCDC:91  IF:E1    IE:00    IME:false \nLCD:100 \n```\n\n## Keyboard instruction\n\n| Keyboard | Gameboy |\n| -------- | ------- |\n| <kbd>Enter</kbd>     | Start   |\n|<kbd>Backspace</kbd>  | Select  |\n| <kbd>\xe2\x86\x91</kbd>  | Up      |\n|  <kbd>\xe2\x86\x93</kbd> | Down    |\n|   <kbd>\xe2\x86\x90</kbd> | Left    |\n|   <kbd>\xe2\x86\x92</kbd>  | Right   |\n|    <kbd>X</kbd>  | A      |\n|     <kbd>Z</kbd>     | B      |\n\n## Features & TODOs\n\n- [x] CPU instruction emulation\n- [x] Timer and interrupt\n- [x] Support for ROM-only, MBC1, MBC2, MBC3 cartridge\n- [x] Sound emulation\n- [x] Graphics emulation\n- [x] Cloud gaming\n- [x] ROM debugger\n- [x] Game saving & restore in cartridge level\n\nThere are still many TODOs\xef\xbc\x9a\n\n- [ ] Support Gameboy Color emulation\n- [ ] Support for MBC4, MBC5, HuC1 cartridge\n- [ ] Sound simulation is incomplete, still got differences compared to the Gameboy real machine\n- [ ] Sprite priority issue (see `Wario Land II` and `Metroid II: Return of Samus`)\n- [ ] Failed to pass Blargg\'s instruction timing test\n- [ ] Game saving & restore in emulator level\n- [ ] Multiplayer support in cloud gaming mode\n\n## Testing\n\n![Testing result](https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live/raw/master/doc/Testing.jpg)\n\n## Contribution\n\nThis emulator is just for learning and entertainment purposes.
