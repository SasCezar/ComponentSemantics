It's focusing on customizability, cross platform support (including embedded) and high performance.\n\n[![Linux (X11/RPi1/RPi2) build status](https://travis-ci.org/mmatyas/pegasus-frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mmatyas/pegasus-frontend)\n[![Windows build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/mmatyas/pegasus-frontend?svg=true&branch=master)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mmatyas/pegasus-frontend)\n[![Windows build status 2](https://circleci.com/gh/mmatyas/pegasus-frontend.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/mmatyas/pegasus-frontend)\n[![Coverity Scan status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/12638/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/mmatyas-pegasus-frontend)\n[![Codacy status](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/716566e918a64b0fb20959c02779bbd2)](https://www.codacy.com/app/mmatyas/pegasus-frontend?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=mmatyas/pegasus-frontend&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)\n[![GPLv3 license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-blue.svg)](LICENSE.md)\n\n- [**Main website**](http://pegasus-frontend.org)\n- [Development thread](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/9598/announcing-pegasus-frontend)\n- [Latest automatic builds][gh ci builds]\n  - Debian/Ubuntu repository: [see below](#installation)\n\n\n## Features\n\n**Open source and cross platform:** runs on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, all Raspberries, Odroids and possibly on other devices too. Hardware accelerated and works with or without X11.\n\n**Full control over the UI:** themes can completely change everything that is on the screen. Add or remove UI elements, menu screens, animations, whatever. Want to make it look like Kodi? Steam? Any other launcher? No problem. You can even [run your custom shader code](etc/promo/shader_demo.jpg).\n\n**ES2 backward compatibility:** Pegasus can use EmulationStation's gamelist files, no need to invent a new set of tools.\n\n**Features you'd expect:** Gamepad support and config. Multiple aspect ratio support. Portable mode support. Live theme reload. A clock in the corner.\n\n\n## Installation and setup\n\nYou can find downloads and platform-specific notes on the [project's website](http://pegasus-frontend.org), under *Downloads*. Documentation and configuration guides can be found [HERE](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/), in particular you might want to take a look on the [Getting started](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started/) page.\n\n\n## Building from source\n\n**Build dependencies**\n\n- C++11 compatible compiler\n- Qt 5.8 or later (5.9 recommended), with the following modules:\n    - QML and QtQuick2\n    - Multimedia\n    - SVG\n    - Gamepad\n    - SQL (SQLite v3)\n\nFor more information, please see the detailed [build guide](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/dev/build).\n\n**Downloading the source**\n\nThe project uses Git submodules. If you cloned the repository recursively, they are automatically cloned as well. In case you forget to do that, you can do it manually like this:\n\n```sh\n# call this after every repo update\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\n**Building**\n\nYou can use any Qt-compatible IDEs, eg. Qt Creator to build the project, or you can manually invoke:\n\n```sh\nmkdir build && cd build\nqmake ..  # qmake [params] [project path], see below\nmake\nmake install  # optional\n```\n\n**For more details**, including possible build parameters, see the [build documentation](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/dev/build).\n\n\n\n## License\n\nPegasus Frontend is available under GPLv3 license.
