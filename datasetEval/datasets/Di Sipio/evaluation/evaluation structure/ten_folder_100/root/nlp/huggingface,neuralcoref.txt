b'# \xe2\x9c\xa8NeuralCoref 4.0: Coreference Resolution in spaCy with Neural Networks.\n\nNeuralCoref is a pipeline extension for spaCy 2.1+ which annotates and resolves coreference clusters using a neural network. NeuralCoref is production-ready, integrated in spaCy\'s NLP pipeline and extensible to new training datasets.\n\nFor a brief introduction to coreference resolution and NeuralCoref, please refer to our [blog post](https://medium.com/huggingface/state-of-the-art-neural-coreference-resolution-for-chatbots-3302365dcf30).\nNeuralCoref is written in Python/Cython and comes with a pre-trained statistical model for **English only**.\n\nNeuralCoref is accompanied by a visualization client [NeuralCoref-Viz](https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref-viz), a web interface  powered by a REST server that can be [tried online](https://huggingface.co/coref/). NeuralCoref is released under the MIT license.\n\n\xe2\x9c\xa8 Version 4.0 out now! Available on pip and compatible with SpaCy 2.1+.\n\n[![Current Release Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/huggingface/neuralcoref.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref/releases)\n[![spaCy](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with%20\xe2\x9d\xa4%20and-spaCy-09a3d5.svg)](https://spacy.io)\n[![Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/huggingface/neuralcoref.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/huggingface/neuralcoref)\n[![NeuralCoref online Demo](https://huggingface.co/coref/assets/thumbnail-large.png)](https://huggingface.co/coref/)\n\n- **Operating system**: macOS / OS X \xc2\xb7 Linux \xc2\xb7 Windows (Cygwin, MinGW, Visual Studio)\n- **Python version**: Python 3.5+ (only 64 bit)\n- **Package managers**: [pip]\n\n## Install NeuralCoref\n\n### Install NeuralCoref with pip\n\nThis is the easiest way to install NeuralCoref.\n\n```bash\npip install neuralcoref\n```\n\n#### `spacy.strings.StringStore size changed` error\n\nIf you have an error mentioning `spacy.strings.StringStore size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility` when loading NeuralCoref with `import neuralcoref`, it means you\'ll have to install NeuralCoref from the distribution\'s sources instead of the wheels to get NeuralCoref to build against the most recent version of SpaCy for your system.\n\nIn this case, simply re-install neuralcoref as follows:\n\n```bash\npip uninstall neuralcoref\npip install neuralcoref --no-binary neuralcoref\n```\n\n#### Installing SpaCy\'s model\n\nTo be able to use NeuralCoref you will also need to have an English model for SpaCy.\n\nYou can use whatever english model works fine for your application but note that the performances of NeuralCoref are strongly dependent on the performances of the SpaCy model and in particular on the performances of SpaCy model\'s tagger, parser and NER components. A larger SpaCy English model will thus improve the quality of the coreference resolution as well (see some details in the [Internals and Model](#-Internals-and-Model) section below).\n\nHere is an example of how you can install SpaCy and a (small) English model for SpaCy, more information can be found on [spacy\'s website](https://spacy.io/usage/models):\n\n```bash\npip install -U spacy\npython -m spacy download en\n```\n\n### Install NeuralCoref from source\n\nYou can also install NeuralCoref from sources. You will need to install the dependencies first which includes Cython and SpaCy.\n\nHere is the process:\n\n```bash\nvenv .env\nsource .env/bin/activate\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref.git\ncd neuralcoref\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install -e .\n```\n\n## Internals and Model\n\nNeuralCoref is made of two sub-modules:\n\n- a rule-based mentions-detection module which uses SpaCy\'s tagger, parser and NER annotations to identify a set of potential coreference mentions, and\n- a feed-forward neural-network which compute a coreference score for each pair of potential mentions.\n\nThe first time you import NeuralCoref in python, it will download the weights of the neural network model in a cache folder.\n\nThe cache folder is set by defaults to `~/.neuralcoref_cache` (see [file_utils.py](./neuralcoref/file_utils.py)) but this behavior can be overided by setting the environment variable `NEURALCOREF_CACHE` to point to another location.\n\nThe cache folder can be safely deleted at any time and the module will download again the model the next time it is loaded.\n\nYou can have more information on the location, downloading and caching process of the internal model by activating python\'s `logging` module before loading NeuralCoref as follows:\n\n```python\nimport logging;\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nimport neuralcoref\n>>> INFO:neuralcoref:Getting model from https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/neuralcoref/neuralcoref.tar.gz or cache\n>>> INFO:neuralcoref.file_utils:https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/neuralcoref/neuralcoref.tar.gz not found in cache, downloading to /var/folders/yx/cw8n_njx3js5jksyw_qlp8p00000gn/T/tmp_8y5_52m\n100%|\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88\xe2\x96\x88| 40155833/40155833 [00:06<00:00, 6679263.76B/s]\n>>> INFO:neuralcoref.file_utils:copying /var/folders/yx/cw8n_njx3js5jksyw_qlp8p00000gn/T/tmp_8y5_52m to cache at /Users/thomaswolf/.neuralcoref_cache/f46bc05a4bfba2ae0d11ffd41c4777683fa78ed357dc04a23c67137abf675e14.7d6f9a6fecf5cf09e74b65f85c7d6896b21decadb2554d486474f63b95ec4633\n>>> INFO:neuralcoref.file_utils:creating metadata file for /Users/thomaswolf/.neuralcoref_cache/f46bc05a4bfba2ae0d11ffd41c4777683fa78ed357dc04a23c67137abf675e14.7d6f9a6fecf5cf09e74b65f85c7d6896b21decadb2554d486474f63b95ec4633\n>>> INFO:neuralcoref.file_utils:removing temp file /var/folders/yx/cw8n_njx3js5jksyw_qlp8p00000gn/T/tmp_8y5_52m\n>>> INFO:neuralcoref:extracting archive file /Users/thomaswolf/.neuralcoref_cache/f46bc05a4bfba2ae0d11ffd41c4777683fa78ed357dc04a23c67137abf675e14.7d6f9a6fecf5cf09e74b65f85c7d6896b21decadb2554d486474f63b95ec4633 to dir /Users/thomaswolf/.neuralcoref_cache/neuralcoref\n```\n\n## Loading NeuralCoref\n\n### Adding NeuralCoref to the pipe of an English SpaCy Language\n\nHere is the recommended way to instantiate NeuralCoref and add it to SpaCY\'s pipeline of annotations:\n\n```python\n\n# Load your usual SpaCy model (one of SpaCy English models)\nimport spacy\nnlp = spacy.load(\'en\')\n\n# Add neural coref to SpaCy\'s pipe\nimport neuralcoref\nneuralcoref.add_to_pipe(nlp)\n\n# You\'re done. You can now use NeuralCoref as you usually manipulate a SpaCy document annotations.\ndoc = nlp(u\'My sister has a dog. She loves him.\')\n\ndoc._.has_coref\ndoc._.coref_clusters\n```\n\n### Loading NeuralCoref and adding it manually to the pipe of an English SpaCy Language\n\nAn equivalent way of adding NeuralCoref to a SpaCy model pipe is to instantiate the NeuralCoref class first and then add it manually to the pipe of the SpaCy Language model.\n\n```python\n\n# Load your usual SpaCy model (one of SpaCy English models)\nimport spacy\nnlp = spacy.load(\'en\')\n\n# load NeuralCoref and add it to the pipe of SpaCy\'s model\nimport neuralcoref\ncoref = neuralcoref.NeuralCoref(nlp.vocab)\nnlp.add_pipe(coref, name=\'neuralcoref\')\n\n# You\'re done. You can now use NeuralCoref the same way you usually manipulate a SpaCy document and it\'s annotations.\ndoc = nlp(u\'My sister has a dog. She loves him.\')\n\ndoc._.has_coref\ndoc._.coref_clusters\n```\n\n## Using NeuralCoref\n\nNeuralCoref will resolve the coreferences and annotate them as [extension attributes](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines#custom-components-extensions) in the spaCy `Doc`,  `Span` and `Token` objects under the `._.` dictionary.\n\nHere is the list of the annotations:\n\n|  Attribute                |  Type              |  Description\n|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------\n|`doc._.has_coref`          |boolean             |Has any coreference has been resolved in the Doc\n|`doc._.coref_clusters`     |list of `Cluster`   |All the clusters of corefering mentions in the doc\n|`doc._.coref_resolved`     |unicode             |Unicode representation of the doc where each corefering mention is replaced by the main mention in the associated cluster.\n|`doc._.coref_scores`       |Dict of Dict        |Scores of the coreference resolution between mentions.\n|`span._.is_coref`          |boolean             |Whether the span has at least one corefering mention\n|`span._.coref_cluster`     |`Cluster`           |Cluster of mentions that corefer with the span\n|`span._.coref_scores`      |Dict                |Scores of the coreference resolution of & span with other mentions (if applicable).\n|`token._.in_coref`         |boolean             |Whether the token is inside at least one corefering mention\n|`token._.coref_clusters`   |list of `Cluster`   |All the clusters of corefering mentions that contains the token\n\nA `Cluster` is a cluster of coreferring mentions which has 3 attributes and a few methods to simplify the navigation inside a cluster:\n\n|  Attribute or method   |  Type / Return type |  Description\n|------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------\n|`i`                     |int                  |Index of the cluster in the Doc\n|`main`                  |`Span`               |Span of the most representative mention in the cluster\n|`mentions`              |list of `Span`       |List of all the mentions in the cluster\n|`__getitem__`           |return `Span`        |Access a mention in the cluster\n|`__iter__`              |yields `Span`        |Iterate over mentions in the cluster\n|`__len__`               |return int           |Number of mentions in the cluster\n\n### Navigating the coreference cluster chains\n\nYou can also easily navigate the coreference cluster chains and display clusters and mentions.\n\nHere are some examples, try them out to test it for yourself.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nimport neuralcoref\nnlp = spacy.load(\'en\')\nneuralcoref.add_to_pipe(nlp)\n\ndoc = nlp(u\'My sister has a dog. She loves him\')\n\ndoc._.coref_clusters\ndoc._.coref_clusters[1].mentions\ndoc._.coref_clusters[1].mentions[-1]\ndoc._.coref_clusters[1].mentions[-1]._.coref_cluster.main\n\ntoken = doc[-1]\ntoken._.in_coref\ntoken._.coref_clusters\n\nspan = doc[-1:]\nspan._.is_coref\nspan._.coref_cluster.main\nspan._.coref_cluster.main._.coref_cluster\n```\n\n**Important**: NeuralCoref mentions are spaCy [Span objects](https://spacy.io/api/span) which means you can access all the usual [Span attributes](https://spacy.io/api/span#attributes) like `span.start` (index of the first token of the span in the document), `span.end` (index of the first token after the span in the document), etc...\n\nEx: `doc._.coref_clusters[1].mentions[-1].start` will give you the index of the first token of the last mention of the second coreference cluster in the document.\n\n## Parameters\n\nYou can pass several additional parameters to `neuralcoref.add_to_pipe` or `NeuralCoref()` to control the behavior of NeuralCoref.\n\nHere is the full list of these parameters and their descriptions:\n\n| Parameter       | Type                    | Description\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------\n|`greedyness`     |float                    |A number between 0 and 1 determining how greedy the model is about making coreference decisions (more greedy means more coreference links). The default value is 0.5.\n|`max_dist`       |int                      |How many mentions back to look when considering possible antecedents of the current mention. Decreasing the value will cause the system to run faster but less accurately. The default value is 50.\n|`max_dist_match` |int                      |The system will consider linking the current mention to a preceding one further than `max_dist` away if they share a noun or proper noun. In this case, it looks `max_dist_match` away instead. The default value is 500.\n|`blacklist`      |boolean                  |Should the system resolve coreferences for pronouns in the following list: `["i", "me", "my", "you", "your"]`. The default value is True (coreference resolved).\n|`store_scores`   |boolean                  |Should the system store the scores for the coreferences in annotations. The default value is True.\n|`conv_dict`      |dict(str, list(str))     |A conversion dictionary that you can use to replace the embeddings of *rare words* (keys) by an average of the embeddings of a list of *common words* (values). Ex: `conv_dict={"Angela": ["woman", "girl"]}` will help resolving coreferences for `Angela` by using the embeddings for the more common `woman` and `girl` instead of the embedding of `Angela`. This currently only works for single words (not for words groups).\n\n### How to change a parameter\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nimport neuralcoref\n\n# Let\'s load a SpaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\'en\')\n\n# First way we can control a parameter\nneuralcoref.add_to_pipe(nlp, greedyness=0.75)\n\n# Another way we can control a parameter\nnlp.remove_pipe("neuralcoref")  # This remove the current neuralcoref instance from SpaCy pipe\ncoref = neuralcoref.NeuralCoref(nlp.vocab, greedyness=0.75)\nnlp.add_pipe(coref, name=\'neuralcoref\')\n```\n\n### Using the conversion dictionary parameter to help resolve rare words\n\nHere is an example on how we can use the parameter `conv_dict` to help resolving coreferences of a rare word like a name:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nimport neuralcoref\n\nnlp = spacy.load(\'en\')\n\n# Let\'s try before using the conversion dictionary:\nneuralcoref.add_to_pipe(nlp)\ndoc = nlp(u\'Deepika has a dog. She loves him. The movie star has always been fond of animals\')\ndoc._.coref_clusters\ndoc._.coref_resolved\n# >>> [Deepika: [Deepika, She, him, The movie star]]\n# >>> \'Deepika has a dog. Deepika loves Deepika. Deepika has always been fond of animals\'\n# >>> Not very good...\n\n# Here are three ways we can add the conversion dictionary\nnlp.remove_pipe("neuralcoref")\nneuralcoref.add_to_pipe(nlp, conv_dict={\'Deepika\': [\'woman\', \'actress\']})\n# or\nnlp.remove_pipe("neuralcoref")\ncoref = neuralcoref.NeuralCoref(nlp.vocab, conv_dict={\'Deepika\': [\'woman\', \'actress\']})\nnlp.add_pipe(coref, name=\'neuralcoref\')\n# or after NeuralCoref is already in SpaCy\'s pipe, by modifying NeuralCoref in the pipeline\nnlp.get_pipe(\'neuralcoref\').set_conv_dict({\'Deepika\': [\'woman\', \'actress\']})\n\n# Let\'s try agin with the conversion dictionary:\ndoc = nlp(u\'Deepika has a dog. She loves him. The movie star has always been fond of animals\')\ndoc._.coref_clusters\n# >>> [Deepika: [Deepika, She, The movie star], a dog: [a dog, him]]\n# >>> \'Deepika has a dog. Deepika loves a dog. Deepika has always been fond of animals\'\n# >>> A lot better!\n```\n\n## Using NeuralCoref as a server\n\nA simple example of server script for integrating NeuralCoref in a REST API is provided as an example in [`examples/server.py`](examples/server.py).\n\nTo use it you need to install falcon first:\n\n```bash\npip install falcon\n```\n\nYou can then start the server as follows:\n\n```bash\ncd examples\npython ./server.py\n```\n\nAnd query the server like this:\n\n```bash\ncurl --data-urlencode "text=My sister has a dog. She loves him." -G localhost:8000\n```\n\nThere are many other ways you can manage and deploy NeuralCoref. Some examples can be found in [spaCy Universe](https://spacy.io/universe/).\n\n## Re-train the model / Extend to another language\n\nIf you want to retrain the model or train it on another language, see our [training instructions](./neuralcoref/train/training.md) as well as our [blog post](https://medium.com/huggingface/how-to-train-a-neural-coreference-model-neuralcoref-2-7bb30c1abdfe)\n'
