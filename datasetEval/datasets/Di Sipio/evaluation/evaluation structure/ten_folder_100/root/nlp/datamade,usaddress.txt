b"usaddress\n=================\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/datamade/usaddress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/datamade/usaddress)[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/5mbcd8ku0tm66noq?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fgregg/usaddress)\n\nusaddress is a Python library for parsing unstructured address strings into address components, using advanced NLP methods. Try it out on our [web interface](https://parserator.datamade.us/usaddress)! For those who aren't Python developers, we also have an [API](https://parserator.datamade.us/api-docs).\n\n**What this can do:** Using a probabilistic model, it makes (very educated) guesses in identifying address components, even in tricky cases where rule-based parsers typically break down.\n\n**What this cannot do:** It cannot identify address components with perfect accuracy, nor can it verify that a given address is correct/valid.\n\nIt also does not normalize the address. However, [this library built on top of usaddress does](https://github.com/GreenBuildingRegistry/usaddress-scourgify).\n\n## How to use the usaddress python library\n\n1. Install usaddress with [pip](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html), a tool for installing and managing python packages ([beginner's guide here](http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/)).\n\n  In the terminal,\n  \n  ```bash\n  pip install usaddress\n  ```\n2. Parse some addresses!\n\n  ![usaddress](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1406537/7869001/65c6ae62-0545-11e5-8b65-5d9e71dface5.gif)\n\n  Note that `parse` and `tag` are different methods:\n  ```python\n  import usaddress\n  addr='123 Main St. Suite 100 Chicago, IL'\n  \n  # The parse method will split your address string into components, and label each component.\n  # expected output: [(u'123', 'AddressNumber'), (u'Main', 'StreetName'), (u'St.', 'StreetNamePostType'), (u'Suite', 'OccupancyType'), (u'100', 'OccupancyIdentifier'), (u'Chicago,', 'PlaceName'), (u'IL', 'StateName')]\n  usaddress.parse(addr)\n  \n  # The tag method will try to be a little smarter\n  # it will merge consecutive components, strip commas, & return an address type\n  # expected output: (OrderedDict([('AddressNumber', u'123'), ('StreetName', u'Main'), ('StreetNamePostType', u'St.'), ('OccupancyType', u'Suite'), ('OccupancyIdentifier', u'100'), ('PlaceName', u'Chicago'), ('StateName', u'IL')]), 'Street Address')\n  usaddress.tag(addr)\n  ```\n\n## How to use this development code (for the nerds)\nusaddress uses [parserator](https://github.com/datamade/parserator), a library for making and improving probabilistic parsers - specifically, parsers that use [python-crfsuite](https://github.com/tpeng/python-crfsuite)'s implementation of conditional random fields. Parserator allows you to train the usaddress parser's model (a .crfsuite settings file) on labeled training data, and provides tools for adding new labeled training data.\n\n### Building & testing the code in this repo\n\nTo build a development version of usaddress on your machine, run the following code in your command line:\n  \n  ```\n  git clone https://github.com/datamade/usaddress.git  \n  cd usaddress  \n  pip install -r requirements.txt  \n  python setup.py develop  \n  parserator train training/labeled.xml usaddress  \n  ```  \n\nThen run the testing suite to confirm that everything is working properly:\n\n   ```\n   nosetests .\n   ```\n   \nHaving trouble building the code? [Open an issue](https://github.com/datamade/usaddress/issues/new) and we'd be glad to help you troubleshoot.\n\n### Adding new training data\n\nIf usaddress is consistently failing on particular address patterns, you can adjust the parser's behavior by adding new training data to the model.
