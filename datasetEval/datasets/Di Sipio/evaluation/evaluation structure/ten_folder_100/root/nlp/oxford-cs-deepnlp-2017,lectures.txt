b'# Preamble\nThis repository contains the lecture slides and course description for the [Deep Natural Language Processing](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2016-2017/dl/) course offered in Hilary Term 2017 at the University of Oxford. \n\nThis is an advanced course on natural language processing. Automatically processing natural language inputs and producing language outputs is a key component of Artificial General Intelligence. The ambiguities and noise inherent in human communication render traditional symbolic AI techniques ineffective for representing and analysing language data. Recently statistical techniques based on neural networks have achieved a number of remarkable successes in natural language processing leading to a great deal of commercial and academic interest in the field\n\nThis is an applied course focussing on recent advances in analysing and generating speech and text using recurrent neural networks. We introduce the mathematical definitions of the relevant machine learning models and derive their associated optimisation algorithms. The course covers a range of applications of neural networks in NLP including analysing latent dimensions in text, transcribing speech to text, translating between languages, and answering questions. These topics are organised into three high level themes forming a progression from understanding the use of neural networks for sequential language modelling, to understanding their use as conditional language models for transduction tasks, and finally to approaches employing these techniques in combination with other mechanisms for advanced applications. Throughout the course the practical implementation of such models on CPU and GPU hardware is also discussed.\n\nThis course is organised by Phil Blunsom and delivered in partnership with the DeepMind Natural Language Research Group.\n\n# Lecturers\n* Phil Blunsom (Oxford University and DeepMind)\n* Chris Dyer (Carnegie Mellon University and DeepMind)\n* Edward Grefenstette (DeepMind)\n* Karl Moritz Hermann (DeepMind)\n* Andrew Senior (DeepMind)\n* Wang Ling (DeepMind)\n* Jeremy Appleyard (NVIDIA)\n\n# TAs\n* Yannis Assael\n* Yishu Miao\n* Brendan Shillingford\n* Jan Buys\n\n# Timetable\n## Practicals\n * Group 1 - Monday, 9:00-11:00 (Weeks 2-8), 60.05 Thom Building\n * Group 2 - Friday, 16:00-18:00 (Weeks 2-8), Room 379\n \n1.

By conditioning an RNN language model on an input representation we can generate contextually relevant language. This very general idea can be applied to transduce sequences into new sequences for tasks such as translation and summarisation, or images into captions describing their content.\n\n[[slides]](Lecture%207%20-%20Conditional%20Language%20Modeling.pdf)\n[[video]](http://media.podcasts.ox.ac.uk/comlab/deep_learning_NLP/2017-01_deep_NLP_7_conditional_lang_mod.mp4)\n\n### Reading\n* [Recurrent Continuous Translation Models.

Lecture 9 - Speech Recognition (ASR) [Andrew Senior]\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is the task of transducing raw audio signals of spoken language into text transcriptions. This talk covers the history of ASR models, from Gaussian Mixtures to attention augmented RNNs, the basic linguistics of speech, and the various input and output representations frequently employed.\n\n[[slides]](Lecture%209%20-%20Speech%20Recognition.pdf)\n[[video]](http://media.podcasts.ox.ac.uk/comlab/deep_learning_NLP/2017-01_deep_NLP_9_speech_recognition.mp4)\n\n\n## 12. Lecture 10 - Text to Speech (TTS) [Andrew Senior]\nThis lecture introduces algorithms for converting written language into spoken language (Text to Speech). TTS is the inverse process to ASR, but there are some important differences in the models applied. Here we review traditional TTS models, and then cover more recent neural approaches such as DeepMind\'s WaveNet model.\n\n[[slides]](Lecture%2010%20-%20Text%20to%20Speech.pdf)\n[[video]](http://media.podcasts.ox.ac.uk/comlab/deep_learning_NLP/2017-01_deep_NLP_10_text_speech.mp4)\n\n\n## 13.

Rather than emailing questions directly, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza to be answered by your fellow students, instructors, and lecturers. However do please do note that all the lecturers for this course are volunteering their time and may not always be available to give a response.\n\nFind our class page at: https://piazza.com/ox.ac.uk/winter2017/dnlpht2017/home\n\n# Assessment\nThe primary assessment for this course will be a take-home assignment issued at the end of the term. This assignment will ask questions drawing on the concepts and models discussed in the course, as well as from selected research publications. The nature of the questions will include analysing mathematical descriptions of models and proposing extensions, improvements, or evaluations to such models. The assignment may also ask students to read specific research publications and discuss their proposed algorithms in the context of the course. In answering questions students will be expected to both present coherent written arguments and use appropriate mathematical formulae, and possibly pseudo-code, to illustrate answers.\n\nThe practical component of the course will be assessed in the usual way.\n\n# Acknowledgements\nThis course would not have been possible without the support of [DeepMind](http://www.deepmind.com), [The University of Oxford Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/), [Nvidia](http://www.nvidia.com), and the generous donation of GPU resources from [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com).\n'
