b'# Deprecation notice\n\nAs of May 1st, 2017 we\'re deprecating this repository in favor of [the new Duckling](https://github.com/facebookincubator/duckling). See our [blog post announcement](https://wit.ai/blog/2017/05/01/new-duckling).\n\nThanks to all the contributors!\n\n# Duckling\n\n[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/wit/duckling/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/wit/duckling)\n\nDuckling is a Clojure library that parses text into structured data:\n\n    \xe2\x80\x9cthe first Tuesday of October\xe2\x80\x9d => {:value "2014-10-07T00:00:00.000-07:00"\n                                       :grain :day}\n\n\nYou can try it out at https://duckling.wit.ai\n\nSee our [blog post announcement](https://wit.ai/blog/2014/10/01/open-source-parser-duckling) for more context.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo use Duckling in your project, you just need two functions: `load!` to load the default configuration, and `parse` to parse a string.\n\n```clojure\n(ns myproject.core\n  (:require [duckling.core :as p]))\n\n(p/load!) ;; Load all languages\n\n(p/parse :en$core ;; core configuration for English ; see also :fr$core, :es$core, :zh$core\n         "wake me up the last Monday of January 2015 at 6am"\n         [:time]) ;; We are interested in :time expressions only ; see also :duration, :temperature, etc.\n\n;; => [{:label :time\n;;        :start 15\n;;        :end 49\n;;        :value {:type "value", :value "2015-01-26T06:00:00.000-02:00", :grain :hour}\n;;        :body "last Monday of January 2015 at 6am"}]\n```\n\nSee the [documentation](https://duckling.wit.ai) for more information.\n'
