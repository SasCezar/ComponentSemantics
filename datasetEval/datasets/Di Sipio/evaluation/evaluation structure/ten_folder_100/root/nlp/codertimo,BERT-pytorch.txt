Code is very simple and easy to understand fastly.\nSome of these codes are based on [The Annotated Transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html)\n\nCurrently this project is working on progress. And the code is not verified yet.\n\n## Installation\n```\npip install bert-pytorch\n```\n\n## Quickstart\n\n**NOTICE : Your corpus should be prepared with two sentences in one line with tab(\\t) separator**\n\n### 0. Prepare your corpus\n```\nWelcome to the \\t the jungle\\n\nI can stay \\t here all night\\n\n```\n\nor tokenized corpus (tokenization is not in package)\n```\nWel_ _come _to _the \\t _the _jungle\\n\n_I _can _stay \\t _here _all _night\\n\n```\n\n\n### 1. Building vocab based on your corpus\n```shell\nbert-vocab -c data/corpus.small -o data/vocab.small\n```\n\n### 2. Train your own BERT model\n```shell\nbert -c data/corpus.small -v data/vocab.small -o output/bert.model\n```\n\n## Language Model Pre-training\n\nIn the paper, authors shows the new language model training methods, \nwhich are "masked language model" and "predict next sentence".\n\n\n### Masked Language Model \n\n> Original Paper : 3.3.1 Task #1: Masked LM \n\n```\nInput Sequence  : The man went to [MASK] store with [MASK] dog\nTarget Sequence :                  the                his\n```\n\n#### Rules:\nRandomly 15% of input token will be changed into something, based on under sub-rules\n\n1. Randomly 80% of tokens, gonna be a `[MASK]` token\n2. Randomly 10% of tokens, gonna be a `[RANDOM]` token(another word)\n3. Randomly 10% of tokens, will be remain as same. But need to be predicted.\n\n### Predict Next Sentence\n\n> Original Paper : 3.3.2 Task #2: Next Sentence Prediction\n\n```\nInput : [CLS] the man went to the store [SEP] he bought a gallon of milk [SEP]\nLabel : Is Next\n\nInput = [CLS] the man heading to the store [SEP] penguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]\nLabel = NotNext\n```\n\n"Is this sentence can be continuously connected?"\n\n understanding the relationship, between two text sentences, which is\nnot directly captured by language modeling\n\n#### Rules:\n\n1. Randomly 50% of next sentence, gonna be continuous sentence.\n2. Randomly 50% of next sentence, gonna be unrelated sentence.\n\n\n## Author\nJunseong Kim, Scatter Lab (codertimo@gmail.com / junseong.kim@scatterlab.co.kr)\n\n## License\n\nThis project following Apache 2.0 License as written in LICENSE file\n\nCopyright 2018 Junseong Kim, Scatter Lab, respective BERT contributors\n\nCopyright (c) 2018 Alexander Rush : [The Annotated Trasnformer](https://github.com/harvardnlp/annotated-transformer)\n'
