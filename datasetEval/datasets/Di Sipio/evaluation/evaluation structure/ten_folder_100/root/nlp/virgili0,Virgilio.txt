For now just use the old organization of the project at the end of this page. \n\n# Contributing to Virgilio\nDo you think that you can help in building the above future map? **Check** [**here**](https://github.com/virgili0/Virgilio/blob/master/docs/contributing.md) the contribution guidelines and send and e-mail to giacomo.ciarlini@student.unife.it or text on Telegram to @Clone95.\n\n# What is Virgilio?\nStudying and reading through the Internet means swimming in an infinite jungle of chaotic information, even more so in rapidly changing innovative fields. \n\nHave you ever felt overwhelmed when trying to approach Data Science without a real \xe2\x80\x9cpath\xe2\x80\x9d to follow? \nAre you tired of clicking \xe2\x80\x9cRun\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cRun\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cRun\xe2\x80\x9d.. on a Jupyter Notebook, with that false sense of confidence given by the comfort zone of the work of others?\n\nHave you ever got confused because of the several and contradicting names for the same algorithm or approach, from different websites and fragmented tutorials? \n\nI want to address these critical problems for free, for everyone. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a joke.\n\nHi, I\'m [Virgilio](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publio_Virgilio_Marone).\n\nLike I did with [Dante](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri), just some centuries ago, I\'ll be your mentor and reference point during your journey through the Internet, providing you complete and organic learning paths for several fields, tools, skills and more.\n\nThe vision of Virgilio is to give everyone the possibility to get into the incredible world of the Data Science and the business and creative possibilities that it offers, to get self-started as a practitioner, gain new cutting edge practical skills or just learn to discriminate good information from poor information.\n\nWe are doing this by providing only high-quality and coherent content, with clear step-by-step paths and a consistent naming system.\nImagine Virgilio as an E-Mentor who will tell you what do to get the next step, the next skill, or to apply them in practice to create value.\n\nBut what does it mean in practice? \n\nIn other words, what\'s the **target** of the Virgilio project?\n\nThere are different scenarios:\n\n- A student from a different field who wants to explore the intersections and the possibilities offered by the Machine Learning and Statistical methods.\n- A curious individual who came in touch with one of the buzzwords related to these fields and wants to discriminate between reliable and unreliable information.\n- An experienced practitioner who wants to have a reference point for the latest techniques, papers and best practices.\n- A manager who wants to understand the possibilities of ML applied to their actual problems, like integration with production systems or new solutions from scratch.\n- A businessman who wants to understand if his data are suitable for an ML project, and what could be the real business value.\n- A salesman who needs to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and Jargon.\n\n## Structure of Virgilio\n\nAs you can imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to intercept all these different needs, so our solution ended up in a hierarchical structure which distinguish the content based on different levels of abstraction.\n\nTo do this, we got our inspiration from Dante\xe2\x80\x99s amazing masterpiece [\xe2\x80\x9cLa Divina Commedia\xe2\x80\x9d](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divina_Commedia), written in over 20 years of work and published for the first time in 1323 d.c.\n\nDante\xe2\x80\x99s journey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been possible without his companion and guide, Virgilio, a roman famous poet (70 a.c.) who inspired generations of artists since the Roman hegemony in Europe.\n\nIn his journey, Dante travel across the different levels of the catholic conception of the divine world at that time, starting from the Inferno (the prison of the damned), passing through the Purgatorio and reaching eventually the Paradiso (you can call it Valhalla or Nirvana, as you prefer :-) ).\n\nIn your journey, you will start from scratch and eventually reach the theoretical knowledge and solid expendable skill.\n\nThe parallelism is natural:\n\n![Figure 2-2](https://raw.github.com/clone95/Data-Science-Study-Paths-March-2019/master/order.png "1") \n\n_Going from top to bottom increases the level of detail and decreases the level of abstraction_. \n\nIn the **Paradiso** you won\xe2\x80\x99t find a single line of code or a math formula, just plain English. \nHere\xe2\x80\x99s the place for introductions, simple explanations, demystifications, and meta-guides (for example a guide about the best way to use Virgilio). \nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the best place for the not-techies, beginners and literally everyone who wants to get in touch with Data Science and Machine Learning without getting bored into technical details. \nDo you want to communicate these innovative fields? Pass from the Paradiso!\n\nIn the **Purgatorio** you can find technical guides for beginners (in the field or in general IT). \nFor example, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find guides about Python, maths, and statistics. \nYou will find guides about study techniques, soft skills and you\xe2\x80\x99ll learn how to develop an analytical mindset too. \nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an obliged step before the Hell. \nDepending on your starting skill, you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably spend here most of the time, learning to code, understand math concepts and more! \n_If you\xe2\x80\x99re a complete beginner_, follow the track we proposed, starting from the Fundamentals.\n\nIn the **Inferno** you won\xe2\x80\x99t find gentle introductions or generic explanations, but a lot of different detailed guides, topics, hands-on tutorials and more!\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find an entire section dedicated to research and daily updates from the field! You\xe2\x80\x99ll find guides like \xe2\x80\x9chow to train a massive neural network over hundreds of GPUs efficiently\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cHow to deal with huge datasets\xe2\x80\x9d, or \xe2\x80\x9chow to fine-tune a preprocessing pipeline\xe2\x80\x9d. Think about Inferno as the place where you will pick up the sub-field you prefer and dive into that. \nIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to learn everything at once! One of the Virgilio\xe2\x80\x99s most important learning strategies is \xe2\x80\x9cOne enemy at time\xe2\x80\x9d, "Divide and conquer!". \nThe three specializations that we provide are Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Agent-based and Reinforcement Learning. \nThese learning paths are the \xe2\x80\x9cfinal bosses\xe2\x80\x9d of the Virgilio\xe2\x80\x99s experience: once you\xe2\x80\x99ll have completed them you will hopefully be skilled enough to land an internship or tackle real business problems!\n\nAbove these you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a plenty of other useful zones:\n\n- Business Skills: these are necessary to unlock the business value in the real world, and they are probably the most valuable asset for a \xe2\x80\x9cdata guy\xe2\x80\x9d to have in his pocket.\n- Tools: here you find guides about useful tools for programming, or scientific computing in general. \n- Research: here you will learn how to find the right papers and digest them. In addition, you\xe2\x80\x99ll discover which teams to follow for your interests.\n- Massive computation: here you\xe2\x80\x99ll find hints and resources for computing on clusters, optimize your system and other advanced topics.\n- ML for Business applications: here we provide additional resources to select a sector and see what are the today\xe2\x80\x99s available techniques for the problems of your interest.\n\n# Paradiso\n#### [Demystification of the key concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning](Topics/Demystification.md)\n#### [What do I need for ML? ](Topics/prerequisites.md)\n#### [Do you really need ML?](Topics/do_you_need_ml.md)\n#### [ML use cases](Topics/use_cases.md) \n#### Project Management -  Coming soon!\n#### [Virgilio\'s Teaching Strategy - Learning to Learn](Topics/teaching.md)\n#### [Introduction to ML](Topics/MLSystems.md)\n\n# Purgatorio\n### Fundamentals\n#### [Math Fundamentals](Topics/math-fundamentals.md)\n#### [Statistics Fundamentals](Topics/statistics-fundamentals.md)\n#### [The Data Science Process](Topics/ds_process.md)\n### Define The Scope and Ask Questions\n#### [Frame The Problem](Topics/frame-the-problem.md)\n#### [Usage and Integration](Topics/usage-and-integration.md)\n#### [Starting a Data Project](Topics/starting-a-data-project.md)\n### Collect and Prepare Data\n### Select and Train a Machine Learning Model\n### Deep Learning\n### Evaluate and Fine-Tune \n### Launch and Mantain the System\n\n- Coming soon!\n\n# Inferno\n- Coming soon!\n\n## Old version of Virgilio\n\nVirgilio was born as a side project just this April, and at the very beginning it was not meant to become what it is now!
