With Rasa, you can build chatbots on:\n- Facebook Messenger\n- Slack\n- Microsoft Bot Framework\n- Rocket.Chat\n- Mattermost\n- Telegram\n- Twilio\n- Your own custom conversational channels\n\nor voice assistants as:\n- Alexa Skills\n- Google Home Actions\n\nRasa\'s primary purpose is to help you build contextual, layered\nconversations with lots of back-and-forth. To have a real conversation,\nyou need to have some memory and build on things that were said earlier.\nRasa lets you do that in a scalable way.\n\nThere\'s a lot more background information in this\n[blog post](https://medium.com/rasa-blog/a-new-approach-to-conversational-software-2e64a5d05f2a).\n\n---\n- **What does Rasa do? \xf0\x9f\xa4\x94**\n  [Check out our Website](https://rasa.com/)\n\n- **I\'m new to Rasa \xf0\x9f\x98\x84**\n  [Get Started with Rasa](https://rasa.com/docs/getting-started/)\n\n- **I\'d like to read the detailed docs \xf0\x9f\xa4\x93**\n  [Read The Docs](https://rasa.com/docs/)\n\n- **I\'m ready to install Rasa \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80**\n  [Installation](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/installation/)\n\n- **I want to learn how to use Rasa \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80**\n  [Tutorial](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/rasa-tutorial/)\n\n- **I have a question \xe2\x9d\x93**\n  [Rasa Community Forum](https://forum.rasa.com/)\n\n- **I would like to contribute \xf0\x9f\xa4\x97**\n  [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)\n\n---  \n## Where to get help\n\nThere is extensive documentation in the [Rasa Docs](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa).\nMake sure to select the correct version so you are looking at\nthe docs for the version you installed.\n\nPlease use [Rasa Community Forum](https://forum.rasa.com) for quick answers to\nquestions.\n\n### README Contents:\n- [How to contribute](#how-to-contribute)\n- [Development Internals](#development-internals)\n- [License](#license)\n\n### How to contribute\nWe are very happy to receive and merge your contributions. You can\nfind more information about how to contribute to Rasa (in lots of\ndifferent ways!) [here](http://rasa.com/community/contribute).\n\nTo contribute via pull request, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create an issue describing the feature you want to work on (or\n   have a look at the [contributor board](https://github.com/orgs/RasaHQ/projects/23))\n2. Write your code, tests and documentation, and format them with ``black``\n3. Create a pull request describing your changes\n\nYour pull request will be reviewed by a maintainer, who will get\nback to you about any necessary changes or questions. You will\nalso be asked to sign a\n[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/RasaHQ/rasa).\n\n\n## Development Internals\n### Running and changing the documentation\nTo build & edit the docs, first install all necessary dependencies:\n\n```\npip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt\npip3 install -r requirements-docs.txt\n```\n\nAfter the installation has finished, you can run and view the documentation\nlocally using:\n```\nmake livedocs\n```\n\nVisit the local version of the docs at http://localhost:8000 in your browser.\nYou can now change the docs locally and the web page will automatically reload\nand apply your changes.\n\n### Running the Tests\nIn order to run the tests, make sure that you have the development requirements installed:\n```bash\nexport PIP_USE_PEP517=false\npip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt\npip3 install -e .\nmake prepare-tests-ubuntu # Only on Ubuntu and Debian based systems\nmake prepare-tests-macos  # Only on macOS\n```\n\nThen, run the tests:\n```bash\nmake test\n```\n\nThey can also be run at multiple jobs to save some time:\n```bash\nmake test -j [n]\n```\n\nWhere `[n]` is the number of jobs desired. If omitted, `[n]` will be automatically chosen by pytest.\n\n### Steps to release a new version\nReleasing a new version is quite simple, as the packages are build and distributed by travis.\n\n*Terminology*:\n* patch release (third version part increases): 1.1.2 -> 1.1.3\n* minor release (second version part increases): 1.1.3 -> 1.2.0\n* major release (first version part increases): 1.2.0 -> 2.0.0\n\n*Release steps*:\n1. Create a new branch and \n\n  * Update [rasa/version.py](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/blob/master/rasa/version.py) to reflect the correct version number\n  * Edit the [CHANGELOG.rst](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst), create a new section for the release (eg by moving the items from the collected master section) and create a new master logging section\n  * Edit the [migration guide](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/blob/master/docs/migration-guide.rst) to provide assistance for users updating to the new version\n2. Commit the changes and create a PR against master or the release branch (e.g. `1.2.x`)\n3. Once your PR is merged, tag a new release (this SHOULD always happen on master or release branches), e.g. using\n    ```\n    git tag 1.2.0 -m "Some helpful line describing the release"\n    git push origin 1.2.0 --tags\n    ```\n    travis will build this tag and push a package to [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rasa)\n5. **If this is a minor release**, a new release branch should be created pointing to the same commit as the tag to allow for future patch releases, e.g.\n    ```\n    git checkout -b 1.2.x\n    git push origin 1.2.x\n    ```\n\n### Code Style\n\nTo ensure a standardized code style we use the formatter [black](https://github.com/ambv/black).\nTo ensure our type annotations are correct we use the type checker [pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype). \nIf your code is not formatted properly or doesn\'t type check, travis will fail to build.\n\n#### Formatting\n\nIf you want to automatically format your code on every commit, you can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).\nJust install it via `pip install pre-commit` and execute `pre-commit install` in the root folder.\nThis will add a hook to the repository, which reformats files on every commit.\n\nIf you want to set it up manually, install black via `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.\nTo reformat files execute\n```\nmake formatter\n```\n\n#### Type Checking\n\nIf you want to check types on the codebase, install `pytype` using `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.\nTo check the types execute\n```\nmake types\n```\n\n### Deploying documentation updates\n\nWe use `sphinx-versioning` to build docs for tagged versions and for the master branch.\nThe static site that gets built is pushed to the `docs` branch of this repo, which doesn\'t contain\nany code, only the site.\n\nWe host the site on netlify. When there is a reason to update the docs (e.g. master has changed or we have\ntagged a new version) we trigger a webhook on netlify (see `.travis.yml`). \n\n\n## License\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\nCopyright 2019 Rasa Technologies GmbH.
