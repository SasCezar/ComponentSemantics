b"**These tutorials have been merged into [the official PyTorch tutorials](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials). Please go there for better maintained versions of these tutorials compatible with newer versions of PyTorch.**\n\n---\n\n![Practical Pytorch](https://i.imgur.com/eBRPvWB.png)\n\nLearn PyTorch with project-based tutorials. These tutorials demonstrate modern techniques with readable code and use regular data from the internet.\n\n## Tutorials\n\n#### Series 1: RNNs for NLP\n\nApplying recurrent neural networks to natural language tasks, from classification to generation.\n\n* [Classifying Names with a Character-Level RNN](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/char-rnn-classification/char-rnn-classification.ipynb)\n* [Generating Shakespeare with a Character-Level RNN](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/char-rnn-generation/char-rnn-generation.ipynb)\n* [Generating Names with a Conditional Character-Level RNN](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/conditional-char-rnn/conditional-char-rnn.ipynb)\n* [Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/seq2seq-translation/seq2seq-translation.ipynb)\n* [Exploring Word Vectors with GloVe](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/glove-word-vectors/glove-word-vectors.ipynb)\n* *WIP* Sentiment Analysis with a Word-Level RNN and GloVe Embeddings\n\n#### Series 2: RNNs for timeseries data\n\n* *WIP* Predicting discrete events with an RNN\n\n## Get Started\n\nThe quickest way to run these on a fresh Linux or Mac machine is to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview):\n```\ncurl -LO https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.3.0-Linux-x86_64.sh\nbash Anaconda3-4.3.0-Linux-x86_64.sh\n```\n\nThen install PyTorch:\n\n```\nconda install pytorch -c soumith\n```\n\nThen clone this repo and start Jupyter Notebook:\n\n```\ngit clone http://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch\ncd practical-pytorch\njupyter notebook\n```\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n### PyTorch basics\n\n* http://pytorch.org/ For installation instructions\n* [Offical PyTorch tutorials](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/) for more tutorials (some of these tutorials are included there)\n* [Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60-minute Blitz](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) to get started with PyTorch in general\n* [Introduction to PyTorch for former Torchies](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20PyTorch%20for%20former%20Torchies.ipynb) if you are a former Lua Torch user\n* [jcjohnson's PyTorch examples](https://github.com/jcjohnson/pytorch-examples) for a more in depth overview (including custom modules and autograd functions)\n\n### Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n* [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) shows a bunch of real life examples\n* [Deep Learning, NLP, and Representations](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/) for an overview on word embeddings and RNNs for NLP\n* [Understanding LSTM Networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) is about LSTMs work specifically, but also informative about RNNs in general\n\n### Machine translation\n\n* [Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078)\n* [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215)\n\n### Attention models\n\n* [Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473)\n* [Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025)\n\n### Other RNN uses\n\n* [A Neural Conversational Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869)\n\n### Other PyTorch tutorials\n\n* [Deep Learning For NLP In PyTorch](https://github.com/rguthrie3/DeepLearningForNLPInPytorch)\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf you have ideas or find mistakes [please leave a note](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/issues/new).\n"
