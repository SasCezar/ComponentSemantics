Download zip file from Facebook and get info about friends, ranking by message, vocabulary, contacts, friends added statistics and more.\n\n# What's inside\n\n* Ranking of friends by messages (number of messages sent, who sent more, how many words, characters in conversation)\n* Your most used words in conversations, the most frequent words from English language and also Polish (my native language) are deleted. So you get quite good and interesting results.\n* Your overall statistics of messaging: total number of messages, words, characters, unique words.\n* How many messages were sent by period: month, week, year, hour. So you can easily get what type of writer you are: night owl vs. early bird. Find your most busy messaging days.\n* How your history of making friends looked like? Breakdown by month, year, weekend vs. working day, most busy days, weeks and months.\n\n# How to run\n\n**Remember you need to use english language(US) on facebook for download**\n\n It won't work if you use different language because of date formatting, different titles on pages. This script uses `nokogiri` internally to parse data.\n\n1. Go to settings on Facebook and switch to English language(US), you can later go back to your native langauge.\n2. From Facebook settings, request copy of your data.\n3. You should get an email back in about 30 minutes.\n4. Download the zip file from the link provided in email.\n5. Extract the file and then get path to catalog with copy of your data. In my case it was: `/Users/przemyslawmroczek/Downloads/facebook-przemekmroczek90/`.\n6. Clone this repository with script.\n7. You need to install `ruby`, `gem bundler`, `gem nokogiri`, `gem axlsx`. There are extensive tutorials in the web how to do it and it's beyond this readme.\n8. Go to folder where you cloned `facebook_data_analyzer`.\n9. Run `bin/facebook_data_analyzer -c path_to_catalog_with_copy_of_facebook_data` in my case this command looked like: `bin/facebook_data_analyzer -c /Users/przemyslawmroczek/Downloads/facebook-przemekmroczek90/`\n10. You will see the script running and analyzing your conversations. At the end you will see it generated new excel file `facebook_analysis.xlsx`, and html file `facebook_analysis.html`.\n\nOptional:\nIf the `DEBUG` environment variable is present, messages are getting converted as json for speed improvement.\n\n```bash\nbin/facebook_data_analyzer -v -c <path_to_catalog_with_copy_of_facebook_data>\n\nParsing Messages    |Time: 00:00:01 | =======| Time: 00:00:01\nAnalyzing Messages  |Time: 00:00:04 | =======| Time: 00:00:04\n= Export facebook_analysis.xlsx\n= Export facebook_analysis.html\n```\n\n## Minimal Command\n```bash\nbin/facebook_data_analyzer -c <path_to_catalog_with_copy_of_facebook_data>\n```\n\n## Available Options\n```bash\nbin/facebook_data_analyzer --help\n```\n\n```bash\nFacebookDataAnalyzer\n    -c example/facebook-monaleigh,   set directory to facebook export\n        --catalog\n    -f, --filename facebook_analysis set the name of the generated files\n    -p, --[no-]parallel              use parallel processing if set\n    -h, --[no-]html                  export html when set\n    -v, --[no-]verbose               when set displays additional information\n    -b, --[no-]benchmark             only runs the benchmark if set\n        --help                       Show this message\n    -V, --version                    Print version\n```\n\n## Default values\n```bash\ncatalog         default: 'example/facebook-monaleigh'\nfilename        default: 'facebook_analysis'\nparallel        default: true\nhtml            default: true\nverbose         default: false\nbenchmark       default: false\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nPlease consider running your changes with\n```bash\nbin/facebook_data_analyzer --benchmark\n```\nbefore making a pull request.
