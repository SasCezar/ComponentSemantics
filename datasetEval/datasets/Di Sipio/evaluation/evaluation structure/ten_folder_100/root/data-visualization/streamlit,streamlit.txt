b'# Welcome to Streamlit :wave:\n\n**The fastest way to build custom ML tools.**\n\nStreamlit lets you create apps for your machine learning projects with deceptively simple Python scripts. It supports hot-reloading, so your app updates live as you edit and save your file. No need to mess with HTTP requests, HTML, JavaScript, etc. All you need is your favorite editor and a browser. Take a look at Streamlit in action:\n\n![Example of live coding a dashboard in Streamlit|635x380](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/streamlit/original/1X/292e985f7f75ef7bef8c27b5899f71f76cd577e0.gif)\n\n**Check out our [launch blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/coding-ml-tools-like-you-code-ml-models-ddba3357eace)!!**\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip install streamlit\nstreamlit hello\n```\n\n## Example\n\nStreamlit lets you build interactive apps ridiculously easily:\n\n```python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nx = st.slider(\'Select a value\')\nst.write(x, \'squared is\', x * x)\n```\n\n<img src="https://streamlit-demo-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/squared-image-for-github-readme-2.png" width=490/>\n\n## A Bigger Example\n\nDespite its simplicity Streamlit lets you build incredibly rich and powerful tools. [This demo project](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving) lets you browse the entire [Udacity self-driving-car dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car) and run inference in real time using the [YOLO object detection net](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo).\n\n![Making-of Animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving/master/av_final_optimized.gif "Making-of Animation")\n\nThe complete demo is implemented in less than 300 lines of Python. In fact, the app contains [only 23 Streamlit calls](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving/blob/master/app.py) which illustrates all the major building blocks of Streamlit. You can try it right now with:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade streamlit opencv-python\nstreamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving/master/app.py\n```\n\n## More Information\n\n- Our [launch post](https://towardsdatascience.com/coding-ml-tools-like-you-code-ml-models-ddba3357eace)\n- Our lovely [community](https://discuss.streamlit.io/)\n- Streamlit [documentation](https://streamlit.io/docs)\n- More [demo projects](https://github.com/streamlit/)\n- If you would like to contribute, see [instructions here](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Contributing)\n\n## Streamlit for Teams\n\n[Streamlit for Teams](https://streamlit.io/forteams/) is our enterprise edition, with single-click deploy, authentication, web editing, versioning, and more.
