b'# SandDance\n\nVisually explore, understand, and present your data.\n\n![sanddance-animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11507384/54236654-52d42800-44d1-11e9-859e-6c5d297a46d2.gif)\n\nBy using easy-to-understand views, SandDance helps you find insights about your data, which in turn help you tell stories supported by data, build cases based on evidence, test hypotheses, dig deeper into surface explanations, support decisions for purchases, or relate data into a wider, real world context.\n\nSandDance uses unit visualizations, which apply a one-to-one mapping between rows in your database and marks on the screen.\nSmooth animated transitions between views help you to maintain context as you interact with your data.\n\n> This new version of SandDance has been rebuilt from scratch with the goal of being modular, extensible, and embeddable into your custom applications. We are now on GitHub so that we are open and driven by the community through contributions, feature requests, and discussion.\n\nSandDance was created by the [Microsoft Research VIDA Group](https://aka.ms/vida) which explores novel technologies for visualization and immersive data analytics. \n\n## Where can I use SandDance?\n* [Try it now on the web](https://microsoft.github.io/SandDance/app/)\n* [Power BI](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/WA200000430) - [*see additional info*](https://github.com/microsoft/SandDance/blob/master/powerbi.md)\n* [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/sanddance-extension?view=sql-server-2017)\n* [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msrvida.vscode-sanddance)\n* [Observable](https://observablehq.com/collection/@danmarshall/sanddance)\n* In your own JavaScript apps - see below\n\n## Component architecture\n\nSandDance is an offering of several JavaScript components:\n\n* [sanddance](packages/sanddance/README.md) - the core SandDance visualization canvas.\n* [sanddance-react](packages/sanddance-react/README.md) - the core SandDance visualization canvas for use in React based applications.\n* [sanddance-explorer](packages/sanddance-explorer/README.md) - the core SandDance visualization canvas with UI to enable data exploration, for use in React based applications.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* April 2019 - Initial release to GitHub.\n* August 2019 - Initial release to AppSource (Power BI marketplace).\n\n## Known issues\n\n* Animations require a WebGL2 enabled browser.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n* PowerBI custom visual based on this new architecture.\n* Additional views, such as stacks.\n* Code examples and tutorials.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nSandDance is created with open source libraries, using [Vega](https://vega.github.io) for chart layout and [Deck.gl](https://deck.gl) for WebGL rendering.\n\n## Development\n\nSee [dev.md](dev.md)\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
