b'JFreeChart\n==========\n\nVersion 1.5.0, 5 November 2017.\n\n[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.jfree/jfreechart/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.jfree/jfreechart)\n\nOverview\n--------\nJFreeChart is a comprehensive free chart library for the Java(tm) platform that \ncan be used on the client-side (JavaFX and Swing) or the server side (with\nexport to multiple formats including SVG, PNG and PDF).\n\n![JFreeChart sample](http://jfree.org/jfreechart/images/coffee_prices.png)\n\nThe home page for the project is:\n\nhttp://www.jfree.org/jfreechart\n\nJFreeChart requires JDK 1.6.0 or later.  If JavaFX support is required, you\nneed to also include the JFreeChart-FX extensions:\n\nhttps://github.com/jfree/jfreechart-fx\n\nThe library is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public \nLicense (LGPL) version 2.1 or later.\n\n\nUsing JFreeChart\n----------------\nTo use JFreeChart in your projects, add the following dependency to your build tool:\n\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.jfree</groupId>\n        <artifactId>jfreechart</artifactId>\n        <version>1.5.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n\n\nBuilding JFreeChart\n-------------------\nYou can build JFreeChart using Maven by issuing the following command from the root directory of the project:\n\n    mvn clean install\n\nThe build requires JDK 1.6.0 or later.\n\n\nMigration from JFreeChart 1.0.x\n-------------------------------\nWhen migrating from JFreeChart 1.0.x to JFreeChart 1.5.0, please be aware of the following API changes:\n\n* all the classes from JCommon that are used by JFreeChart have integrated within the JFreeChart jar file within a different package than before (you will need to change your imports);\n* many methods `getBaseXXX()/setBaseXXX()` have been renamed `setDefaultXXX()/getDefaultXXX()`;\n* the `ChartUtilities` class has been renamed `ChartUtils`;\n* all the classes relating to pseudo-3D charts have been removed, as much better 3D charts are offered by [Orson Charts](https://github.com/jfree/orson-charts) so we prefer not to maintain the pseudo-3D chart code within JFreeChart;\n* the `SegmentedTimeline` class has been removed due to being (a) complex, (b) not always being correct and, as a result, generating too many support requests;\n* the `org.jfree.chart.utils.ParamChecks` class has been renamed `org.jfree.chart.utils.Args`.\n\nPlease refer to [Issue 66](https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart/issues/66) for additional info.\n\n\nDemos\n-----\nA small set of demo applications can be found in the following projects here\nat GitHub:\n\n* [JFree-Demos](https://github.com/jfree/jfree-demos "JFree-Demos Project Page at GitHub")\n* [JFree-FXDemos](https://github.com/jfree/jfree-fxdemos "JFree-FXDemos Project Page at GitHub")\n\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n##### Version 1.5.0 (5 November 2017)\n- all JavaFX classes moved to a separate project;\n- added cleaner method to create histograms in `ChartFactory`;\n- JCommon

year\'s JavaOne conference in San Francisco.  The session is scheduled for 6.45pm to 7.35pm on Wednesday 3 June.                        \n\nThis release contains:\n\n- updates to the `ChartPanel` class to support copying charts to the clipboard, \n  panning and mouse-wheel zooming, and an overlay mechanism that supports\n  crosshairs;\n- enhancements to the auto-range calculation for axes, providing the ability\n  to use subranges only and also to skip hidden series;\n- updates for many of the `CategoryItemRenderer` implementations to ensure that\n  they respect the `seriesVisible` flags;\n- an improvement to the `TimeSeries` class so that it is no longer necessary to\n  specify the time period type in the constructor;\n- a new `SamplingXYLineRenderer` for improving the performance of time series\n  charts with large datasets;\n- the `XYSeries/XYSeriesCollection` classes now cache the minimum and maximum\n  data values to improve the performance of charts with large datasets;\n- entities are now created for the chart, data area and axes, allowing mouse\n  clicks to be detected for these regions;\n- added a bar alignment factor to the `XYBarRenderer` class;\n- a new `errorIndicatorStroke` field for the `StatisticalLineAndShapeRenderer` and `XYErrorRenderer` classes;\n- added a new `HeatMapDataset` interface, `DefaultHeatMapDataset` implementation,\n  and a `HeatMapUtilities` class to make it easier to create heat map charts;\n- there is a new flag to allow an `XYDataImageAnnotation` to be included in the\n  automatic range calculation for the axes;\n- additional attributes in the `XYTextAnnotation` class;\n- added a `sampleFunction2DToSeries()` method to the `DatasetUtilities` class;\n- some changes to the `ChartPanel` class that help to work around a regression in\n  JRE 1.6.0_10 relating to drawing in XOR mode.  Regarding this final point:\n     * the default value for the `useBuffer` flag has changed to true, which means\n       that all charts will, by default, be rendered into an off-screen image\n       before being displayed in the `ChartPanel`;\n     * the zoom rectangle is drawn using XOR mode *only* when the `useBuffer`\n       flag has been set to false.\n  For most usage, this should improve performance (but at the cost of using more\n  memory for each `ChartPanel` used in your application);\n\n###### Bug Fixes\n\n- 2690293 : Problem with Javascript escape characters;\n- 2617557 : `StandardDialScale` ignored `tickLabelPaint`;\n- 2612649 : `Stroke` selection in plot property editor;\n- 2583891 : `SWTGraphics2D.fillPolygon()` not implemented;\n- 2564636 : `Month` constructor ignores Locale;\n- 2502355 : `ChartPanel` sending multiple events;\n- 2490803 : `PeriodAxis.setRange()` method doesn\'t take into account that the axis\n          displays whole periods;\n\nIn addition, a bug in the `SlidingCategoryDataset` class has been fixed, the\ncorrect outline paint is now used by `GradientXYBarPainter`, a new method\nhas been added to the `ImageMapUtilities` class to escape special characters\nin Javascript strings to avoid problems with the OverLIB and DynamicDrive\ntooltips, and there are some important fixes in the `LogAxis` class.\n\nThis release passes 2110 JUnit tests (0 failures) on JRE 1.6.0_12.\n\n\n##### Version 1.0.12 (31-Dec-2008)\n\nThis release adds \n- support for minor tick marks;\n- mapping datasets to more than one axis;\n- an important fix for the `XYSeries` class (relating to the `addOrUpdate()` method);\n- plus numerous other bug fixes.\n\nThis release passes 1996 JUnit test (0 failures) on JRE 1.6.0_10.\n\n###### API Adjustments\n- `CategoryPlot` : added `mapDatasetToDomainAxes()` and `mapDatasetToRangeAxes()` methods;\n- `Month` : added a new constructor `Month(Date, TimeZone, Locale)` and deprecated `Month(Date, TimeZone)`;\n- `Quarter` : added a new constructor `Quarter(Date, TimeZone, Locale)` and deprecated `Quarter(Date, TimeZone)`;\n- `XYPlot` : added `mapDatasetToDomainAxes()` and `mapDatasetToRangeAxes()` methods;\n- `Year` : added a new constructor `Year(Date, TimeZone, Locale)` and deprecated `Year(Date, TimeZone)`;\n\n###### Bug Fixes\n- 2471906 : `XYAreaRenderer` with dashed outline -

See the SurveyResultsDemo.java application\n          for an example;\n        - included numerous bug fixes;\n\n##### Version 0.9.8 (24-Apr-2003)\n        - changed package naming from com.jrefinery.* to org.jfree.*;\n        - added new TimePeriodValuesCollection class;\n        - added MIME type code to ServletUtilities class;\n        - reversed the order of PieDataset and KeyedValuesDataset in\n          the class hierarchy;\n        - reversed the order of CategoryDataset and KeyedValues2DDataset\n          in the class hierarchy;\n        - minor bug fixes;\n\n##### Version 0.9.7 (11-Apr-2003)\n        - added a new ValueDataset interface and DefaultValueDataset\n          class, and changed the CompassPlot class to use this instead\n          of MeterDataset;\n        - added DataUtilities class, to support creation of Pareto\n          charts (new demo included);\n        - updated writeImageMap method as suggested by Xavier Poinsard\n          (see Feature Request 688079);\n        - implemented Serializable for most classes (this is likely to\n          require further testing);\n        - incorporated contour plot updates from David M. O\'Donnell;\n        - added new CategoryTextAnnotation and XYLineAnnotation\n          classes;\n        - added new HorizontalCategoryAxis3D class contributed by\n          Klaus Rheinwald;\n\n        Bug fixes:\n        - added a workaround for JVM crash (a JDK bug) in pie charts\n          with small sections (see bug report 620031);\n        - fixed minor bug in HorizontalCategoryPlot constructor (see\n          bug report 702248);\n        - added code to ensure HorizontalNumberAxis3D is not drawn if\n          it is not visible (see bug report 702466);\n        - added small fix for suppressed chart change events (see bug\n          report 690865);\n        - added pieIndex parameter to tooltip and URL generators for\n          pie charts;\n        - fixed bug in getLastMillisecond() method for the Second\n          class and the getFirstMillisecond() method for the Year\n          class (picked up in JUnit tests);\n        - in TextTitle, changed width used for relative spacing to fix\n          bug 703050;\n\n##### Version 0.9.6 (17-Feb-2003) Bug fixes:\n        - fixed null pointer exception in DefaultCategoryDataset;\n        - fixed update problem for PaintTable, StrokeTable and\n          ShapeTable objects;\n        - added methods to control colors in PiePlot (these were\n          inadvertantly removed in the changes made for 0.9.5);\n        - fixed auto-range update problem for secondary axis;\n        - fixed missing category labels in the overlaid category plot;\n        - fixed constructors for symbolic axes;\n        - corrected error in Javadoc generation (Ant script);\n\n##### Version 0.9.5 (6-Feb-2003) \n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT MAJOR CHANGES TO THE\n        JFREECHART API HAVE BEEN MADE IN THIS RELEASE!\n\n        - added support for secondary axes, datasets and renderers;\n        - added new data interfaces (Value, Values, Values2D,\n          KeyedValues and KeyedValues2D) and incorporated these into\n          the existing PieDataset and CategoryDataset interfaces.\n        - modified the CategoryDataset interface to be more\n          symmetrical, data is organised in rows and columns (as\n          before) but can now be accessed by row/column index or\n          row/column key.\n        - added support for reading PieDatasets and CategoryDatasets\n          from XML files.\n        - created separate packages for the axes\n          (com.jrefinery.chart.axis), plots (com.jrefinery.chart.plot)\n          and renderers (com.jrefinery.chart.renderer).\n        - series attributes (paint, outline paint, stroke and shape)\n          are now controlled by the renderer classes using lookup\n          tables.  Introduced the DrawingSupplier interface (and\n          DefaultDrawingSupplier class) which is used to populate the\n          lookup tables from a common source (necessary to coordinate\n          complex combined charts).\n        - the chart legend can now display shapes corresponding to\n          series.\n        - moved responsibility for category distribution to the\n          CategoryAxis class, which tidies up the code in the\n          CategoryPlot classes.\n        - gridlines are now controlled by the CategoryPlot and XYPlot\n          classes, not the axes (included in this change is the\n          addition of gridlines for the CategoryPlot domain values).\n        - changed the list of titles in the JFreeChart class to a\n          title and a list of subtitles.\n        - added new renderers for XYPlot (XYBubbleRenderer and\n          YIntervalRenderer).\n        - modified Gantt chart to display sub-tasks.\n        - added ContourPlot class (still experimental) by David\n          M. O\'Donnell.\n        - introduced new MovingAverage class.\n        - ChartMouseEvent now includes source chart.\n        - numerous bug fixes.\n        - lots of Javadoc updates.\n\n##### Version 0.9.4 (18-Oct-2002)  \n\nAdded a new stacked area chart (contributed by Dan\n        Rivett) and a compass plot (contributed by Bryan Scott).  Updated\n        the ThermometerPlot class. Added a new XYDotRenderer for scatter\n        plots. Modified combined and overlaid plots to use the series colors\n        specified in the sub plot rather than the parent plot (this makes it\n        easier to align the colors in the legend).  Added Regression class\n        for linear and power regressions.  BasicTimeSeries can now\n        automatically drop "old" data.  Some clean-up work in the code for\n        tooltips and the event listener mechanism.  Richard Atkinson has\n        incorporated some useful extensions for servlets/JSP developers.\n\n        Ran Checkstyle and corrected issues reported for most classes.\n        Checkstyle is a free utility that you can download from:\n\n            http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net\n\n        Fixed bugs and updated documentation.\n\n        API changes include:\n        - added tickMarkPaint to Axis constructor (also affects\n          subclasses);\n        - added getLegendItems() to Plot, and deprecated\n          getLegendItemLabels();\n        - added getLegendItem(int) to XYItemRenderer and\n          CategoryItemRenderer.\n        - most \'protected\' member variables have been changed to\n          \'private\'.\n\n##### Version 0.9.3 (4-Sep-2002) \n\n- Added multiple pie charts based on `CategoryDataset`;\n- Updated logarithmic axes;\n- Improved URL support for image map generation;\n- Moved the `com.jrefinery.data` package from JCommon to JFreeChart. \n- Added simple framework for chart annotations;\n- Improved control over renderers;\n- Duplicate x-values now allowed in `XYSeries`;
