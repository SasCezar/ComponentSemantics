b'# Data-Forge\n\nThe JavaScript data transformation and analysis toolkit inspired by Pandas and LINQ.\n\n*Implemented* in TypeScript.<br>\n*Used* in JavaScript ES5+ or TypeScript.\n\n<a target="_blank" href="https://www.data-forge-notebook.com/"><img align="right" src="images/support2.png"></a>\n\nTo learn more about Data-Forge [visit the home page](http://data-forge-js.com/).\n\nRead about <a target="_blank" href="http://js4ds.org/#s:dataforge">Data-Forge for data science</a> in the book \n<a target="_blank" href="http://js4ds.org">JavaScript for Data Science</a>.\n\nWant to get in touch? Please see my contact details at the end.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/data-forge/data-forge-ts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/data-forge/data-forge-ts)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/data-forge/data-forge-ts/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/data-forge/data-forge-ts?branch=master)\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/data-forge.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/data-forge)\n[![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n[![Issues](http://img.shields.io/github/issues/data-forge/data-forge-ts.svg)](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-ts/blob/master/issues)\n\n\n**Please note** that this TypeScript repository replaces the [previous JavaScript version of Data-Forge](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-js).\n\n## BREAKING CHANGES\n\nAs of v1.6.9 the dependencies Sugar, Lodash and Moment have been factored out (or replaced with smaller dependencies). This more than halves the bundle size. Hopefully this won\'t cause any problems - but please log an issue if something changes that you weren\'t expecting.\n\n<a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2t2cJu2"><img align="right" src="images/support3.png"></a>\n\nAs of v1.3.0 file system support has been removed from the Data-Forge core API. This is after repeated issues from users trying to get Data-Forge working in the browser, especially under AngularJS 6.\n\nFunctions for reading and writing files have been moved to the separate code library [Data-Forge FS](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-fs).\n\nIf you are using the file read and write functions prior to 1.3.0 then your code will no longer work when you upgrade to 1.3.0. The fix is simple though, where usually you would just require in Data-Forge as follows:\n\n```javascript\nconst dataForge = require(\'data-forge\');\n```\n\nNow you must also require in the new library as well:\n\n```javascript\nconst dataForge = require(\'data-forge\');\nrequire(\'data-forge-fs\');\n```\n\nData-Forge FS augments Data-Forge core so that you can use the readFile/writeFile functions as in previous versions and as is shown in this readme and the guide.\n\nIf you still have problems with AngularJS 6 please see this workaround:\nhttps://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-ts/issues/3#issuecomment-438580174\n\n## Install\n\nTo install for Node.js and the browser:\n\n    npm install --save data-forge\n\nIf working in Node.js and you want the functions to read and write data files:\n\n    npm install --save data-forge-fs\n\n## Quick start\n\nData-Forge can load CSV, JSON or arbitrary data sets. \n\nParse the data, filter it, transform it, aggregate it, sort it and much more.\n\nUse the data however you want or export it to CSV or JSON.\n\nHere\'s an example:\n\n```JavaScript\nconst dataForge = require(\'data-forge\');\nrequire(\'data-forge-fs\'); // For readFile/writeFile.\n\ndataForge.readFileSync(\'./input-data-file.csv\') // Read CSV file (or JSON!)\n    .parseCSV()\n    .parseDates(["Column B"]) // Parse date columns.\n    .parseInts(["Column B", "Column C"]) // Parse integer columns.\n    .parseFloats(["Column D", "Column E"]) // Parse float columns.\n    .dropSeries(["Column F"]) // Drop certain columns.\n    .where(row => predicate(row)) // Filter rows.\n    .select(row => transform(row)) // Transform the data.\n    .asCSV() \n    .writeFileSync("./output-data-file.csv"); // Write to output CSV file (or JSON!)\n```\n\n## From the browser\n\nData-Forge has been tested with Browserify and Webpack. Please see links to examples below.\n\nIf you aren\'t using Browserify or Webpack, the npm package includes a pre-packed browser distribution that you can install and included in your HTML as follows:\n\n```html\n<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/data-forge/dist/web/index.js"></script>\n```\n\nThis gives you the data-forge package mounted under the global variable `dataForge`.\n\nPlease remember that you can\'t use data-forge-fs or the file system functions in the browser.\n\n## Features\n\n- Import and export CSV and JSON data and text files (when using [Data-Forge FS](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-fs)).\n- Or work with arbitrary JavaScript data.\n- Many options for working with your data:\n    - Filtering\n    - Transformation\n    - Extracting subsets\n    - Grouping, aggregation and summarization\n    - Sorting\n    - And much more\n- Great for slicing and dicing tabular data:\n    - Add, remove, transform and generate named columns (series) of data.\n- Great for working with time series data.\n- Your data is indexed so you have the ability to merge and aggregate.\n- Your data is immutable! Transformations and modifications produce a new dataset.\n- Build data pipeline that are evaluated lazily.\n- Inspired by Pandas and LINQ, so it might feel familiar!\n\n## Contributions\n\nWant a bug fixed or maybe to improve performance?\n\nDon\'t see your favourite feature?\n\nNeed to add your favourite Pandas or LINQ feature?\n\nPlease contribute and help improve this library for everyone!\n\nFork it, make a change, submit a pull request.
