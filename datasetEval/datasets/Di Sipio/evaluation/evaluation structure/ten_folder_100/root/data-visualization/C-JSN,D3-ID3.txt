With our integrated Python based data management system and custom generated attribute controls, iD3 supports the full process from importing your data to exporting your final presentation.\n\n\n#### iD3 is in active development. Please follow this repo for contribution guidelines and upcoming updates.\n\n##\n<p align="center">\n  <img alt="iD3 Screenshot" src="assets/id3_screenshot.png">\n</p>\n\n## To Use\nFork or download\n```\n# Clone this repository\ngit clone https://github.com/C-JSN/D3-ID3.git\n# Go into the repository\ncd D3-ID3\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install  \n# Run webpack\nnpm run webpack\n# Run the app  \nnpm start  \n```\nPlease make sure you have Python 3.6 installed.\nClick [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n\n### Keyboard shortcuts:\n```\nctrl + s (main app editor) = run code and render\nctrl + s (data management editor) = run code\n```\n\n### Take control of your visualization\nUpload your own D3 code and see it visualized immediately on the Renderer. Modify your data visualization straight in the editor, or through the custom generated attribute controls to your right and see your changes reflected in the Renderer as you go.\n\n#### New to D3? Use a Template\nSelect a template from our library and start creating right away.\n\n#### Export files\nExport your finalized code to be used on your other projects!\n\nNote: Refresh the Attribute Panel by clicking `Generate Attr` when you upload a new file or run a new template\n\n##\n<p align="center">\n  <img alt="iD3 Data Management" src="assets/id3_data_management.jpg">\n</p>\n\n### Manage your data\nUse your custom data processing algorithms on top of D3\'s built-in functions with our integrated Python based data management system. This system allows you to feed your .csv or .json files through your personal Python script and check your data in the print statement window before sending it back to the main application to render in your visualization.\n\n## Resources\nFind us on www.d3-id3.com  \nSpecial thanks to Mike Bostock for creating [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)  \n\n## Contributors\n[Christian Pascual](https://github.com/crp2002) | [Jeffrey Ma](https://github.com/jjeffreyma) | [Steve Meads](https://github.com/smeads) | [Naomi Lai](https://github.com/eveafeline)\n'
