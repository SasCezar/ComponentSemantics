A simple configuration on Davinci UI can meet multiple visualization requirements. It also supports other visualization features like advanced interaction, industry analysis, pattern searching, social intelligence, etc.\n\n## Design Philosophy\n* Focus on two key concepts, data view (View in Davinci) and visual components (Widget in Davinci) \n\n  * Structural data is presented in Davinci View, from which all the logic, authorization and service are derived.\n  * Visual data is presented in Davinci Widget, from which all the display, interaction and guidance are derived.\n  * View and Widget supplement each other, providing users consistent experience and perception.\n* Strengthen integration and customization capability as well as sharing and intelligence capability\n  * Integration and customization capability means Davinci could seamlessly integrate into third-party systems and be customized,  combining with third-party systems.\n  * Sharing and intelligence capability means users could share their dashboards with others, which stimulates them to improve the visualization ability both in aesthetic perception and technical skills.\n  * In the field of data visualization, Davinci attaches great importance to basic interaction ability and various chart options; meanwhile, it lays more stress on integration and customization capability as well as sharing and intelligence capability.\n\n## Features\n* Data Source Support\n  * Files in CSV format\n  * JDBC data source\n* Data View Support\n  * Customized SQL template\n  * SQL highlighting\n  * SQL test\n  * WriteBack mode\n* Visual Components Support\n  * Pre-defined charts\n  * Controller components\n  * Free Styles\n* Interaction Support\n  * Visual components displayed in full screen\n  * Local controller for visual components\n  * Filtering and cooperation among visual components\n  * Group control for visual components\n  * Local advanced filter for visual components\n  * Paging mode and slider for huge volumes of data\n* Integration Support\n  * Upload visual components in CSV format\n  * Share visual components in a common/authorized way\n  * Share dashboard in a common/authorized way\n* Security Permission Support\n  * Row permission and column permission\n  * Integration of LDAP sign-in\n  \n## Latest Release\nPlease download the latest [RELEASE](https://github.com/edp963/davinci/releases/download/v0.3.0-beta.8/davinci-assembly_3.0.1-0.3.1-SNAPSHOT-dist-beta.8.zip)\n\n## Get Help\nThe fastest way to get response from our developers is to send email to our mail list edp_support@groups.163.com, and welcome to join our WeChat group for online discussion.\n\n[![](https://github.com/edp963/edp-resource/raw/master/WeChat.jpg)](https://github.com/edp963/edp-resource/raw/master/WeChat.jpg)\n\n## License\nPlease refer to [LICENSE](https://github.com/edp963/davinci/blob/master/LICENSE) file.\n  \n\n'
