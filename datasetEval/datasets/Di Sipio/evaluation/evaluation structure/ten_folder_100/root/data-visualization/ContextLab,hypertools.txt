Everyone does it._" - Geoff Hinton\n\n\n![Hypertools example](images/hypertools.gif)\n\n## Overview\n\nHyperTools is designed to facilitate\n[dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction)-based\nvisual explorations of high-dimensional data.  The basic pipeline is\nto feed in a high-dimensional dataset (or a series of high-dimensional\ndatasets) and, in a single function call, reduce the dimensionality of\nthe dataset(s) and create a plot.  The package is built atop many\nfamiliar friends, including [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/),\n[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) and\n[seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).  Our package was recently\nfeatured on\n[Kaggle\'s No Free Hunch blog](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/04/10/exploring-the-structure-of-high-dimensional-data-with-hypertools-in-kaggle-kernels/).  For a general overview, you may find [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb_ER9RGtOM) useful (given as part of the [MIND Summer School](https://summer-mind.github.io) at Dartmouth).\n\n## Try it!\n\nClick the badge to launch a binder instance with example uses:\n\n[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/contextlab/hypertools-paper-notebooks)\n\nor\n\nCheck the [repo](https://github.com/ContextLab/hypertools-paper-notebooks) of Jupyter notebooks from the HyperTools [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08290).\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the latest stable version run:\n\n`pip install hypertools`\n\nTo install the latest unstable version directly from GitHub, run:\n\n`pip install -U git+https://github.com/ContextLab/hypertools.git`\n\nOr alternatively, clone the repository to your local machine:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/ContextLab/hypertools.git`\n\nThen, navigate to the folder and type:\n\n`pip install -e .`\n\n(These instructions assume that you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed on your system)\n\nNOTE: If you have been using the development version of 0.5.0, please clear your\ndata cache (/Users/yourusername/hypertools_data).\n\n## Requirements\n\n+ python 2.7, 3.5+\n+ PPCA>=0.0.2\n+ scikit-learn>=0.18.1\n+ pandas>=0.18.0\n+ seaborn>=0.8.1\n+ matplotlib>=1.5.1\n+ scipy>=0.17.1\n+ numpy>=1.10.4\n+ future\n+ requests\n+ deepdish\n+ pytest (for development)\n+ ffmpeg (for saving animations)\n\nIf installing from github (instead of pip), you must also install the requirements:\n`pip install -r requirements.txt`\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter an error related to installing deepdish (hdf5) on a MacOS system, try installing hdf5 directly using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n```\n$ brew tap homebrew/science\n$ brew install hdf5\n```\nand then re-start the installation.\n\n## Documentation\n\nCheck out our [readthedocs](http://hypertools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page for further documentation, complete API details, and additional examples.\n\n## Citing\n\nWe wrote a short JMLR paper about HyperTools, which you can read [here](http://jmlr.org/papers/v18/17-434.html), or you can check out a (longer) preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08290). We also have a repository with example notebooks from the paper [here](https://github.com/ContextLab/hypertools-paper-notebooks).\n\nPlease cite as:\n\n`Heusser AC, Ziman K, Owen LLW, Manning JR (2018) HyperTools: A Python toolbox for gaining geometric insights into high-dimensional data.
