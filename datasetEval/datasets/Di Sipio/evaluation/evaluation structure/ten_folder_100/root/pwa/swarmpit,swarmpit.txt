You can manage your stacks, services, secrets, volumes, networks etc. After linking your Docker Hub account or custom registry, private repositories can be easily deployed on Swarm. Best of all, you can share this management console securely with your whole team.\n\nMore details about future and past releases can be found in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)\n\n[![Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/fold_left.svg?style=social&label=Follow%20%40swarmpit_io)](https://twitter.com/swarmpit_io)\n\n## Installation\n\nThe only dependency for Swarmpit deployment is Docker with Swarm initialized, we are supporting Docker 1.13 and newer.\n\n### Package installer\nInstaller is your guide to setup Swarmpit platform. For more details see the [installer](https://github.com/swarmpit/installer)\n\n#### Stable version\nDeploy our current milestone version\n\n```\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n  --name swarmpit-installer \\\n  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n  swarmpit/install:1.8\n```\n\n#### Edge version\nDeploy latest version for the brave and true\n\n```\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n  --name swarmpit-installer \\\n  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n  swarmpit/install:edge\n```\n### Manual installation\nSimply deploy Swarmpit by using a compose file from our git repo.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/swarmpit/swarmpit\ndocker stack deploy -c swarmpit/docker-compose.yml swarmpit\n```\n\n[This stack](docker-compose.yml) is a composition of 4 services:\n\n* app - Swarmpit\n* [agent](https://github.com/swarmpit/agent) - Swarmpit agent\n* db - CouchDB (Application data)\n* influxdb - InfluxDB (Cluster statistics)\n\nFeel free to edit the stackfile to change an application port and we strongly recommend to specify following volumes:\n\n* db-data \n* influxdb-data \n\nto shared-volume driver type of your choice. Alternatively, you can link db service to the specific node by using [constraint](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#placement).\n\nSwarmpit is published on port `888` by default.\n\n## Development\n\nSwarmpit is written purely in Clojure and utilizes React on front-end. CouchDB is used to persist application data & InfluxDB for cluster statistics.\n\nEverything about building, issue reporting and setting up development environment can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Demo\n\n[![Try in PWD](https://cdn.rawgit.com/play-with-docker/stacks/cff22438/assets/images/button.png)](http://play-with-docker.com?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swarmpit/swarmpit/master/docker-compose.yml) \n\nDeploys Swarmpit to play-with-docker sandbox. Please wait few moments till application is up and running before accessing\nport 888. Initialization might take a few seconds.\n'
