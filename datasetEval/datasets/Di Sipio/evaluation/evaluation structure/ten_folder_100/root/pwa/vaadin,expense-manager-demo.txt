b'# Progressive Web App with full offline capabilities\n\nThis is an example project for how you can build a [Progressive Web Application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) with [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) and [Vaadin components](https://vaadin.com/components).\n\n\nThe application uses a [Service Worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/) to cache the [Application Shell](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell). A [Web App Manifest file](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/) ensures that the browser identifies our app as a Progressive Web Application and offers the user to install the application through an install banner.\n\n## Live Demo\n[Try the live demo of the Progressive Web Application](https://expensemanager.demo.vaadin.com/).\n\n## Running locally\n\n1. Fork this repository and clone it locally.\n\n2. Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.\n\n3. Run `npm install bower polymer-cli -g` to install tools needed to run the project.\n\n3. When in the `expense-manager` directory, run `npm install` and then `bower install` to install dependencies.\n\n4. Run `polymer serve` to start the development server.\n\n5. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8081\n\n## Linting\n\n### Run all lint tasks in parallel\n\n```\nnpm run lint\n```\n\n### Run ESLint for JS\n\n```\nnpm run lint:javascript\n```\n\n### Run Stylelint for CSS\n\n```\nnpm run lint:css\n```\n\n### Run polymer-linter\n\n```\nnpm run lint:polymer\n```\n\n## Docker container for production\nYou can use the included `Dockerfile` to deploy the built app using [prpl-server](https://github.com/Polymer/prpl-server-node).\n\n## Build project locally\n\nThe default `polymer.json` contains the `"autoBasePath": true` setting to support differential serving with the [prpl-server](https://github.com/Polymer/prpl-server-node).\nThis option makes the build incompatible with static file servers, though. So, in order to serve bundled app locally using `polymer-cli`, do the following steps:\n\n1. Remove `"autoBasePath": true` setting from the `polymer.json`\n\n2. Run `polymer build`\n\n3. Run `polymer serve build/es6-bundled` (you can choose `es5-bundled` instead)\n\nRead more about the build options in the [Polymer: Build for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production) documentation.\n'
