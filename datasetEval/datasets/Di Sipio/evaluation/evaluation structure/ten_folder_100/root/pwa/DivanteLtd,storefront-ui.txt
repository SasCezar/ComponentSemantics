Not ready for production use. Expect some things to be broken and api to change**\n\n**We are looking for contributors and agencies willing to join us and build best UI library for Vue together!**\n\nCustomization-first, performance-oriented and elegant UI framework for eCommerce (and not only) based on Vue.js and [Google Retail UX Playbook](https://services.google.com/fh/files/events/pdf_retail_ux_playbook.pdf). Made with \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f by [Vue Storefront](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront) team and contributors.\n\n- [Website](http://storefrontui.io/)\n- [Documentation](http://docs.storefrontui.io/)\n- [How to contribute](https://docs.storefrontui.io/contributing/become-a-contributor.html)\n- [Storybook](http://storybook.storefrontui.io/)\n- [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GS8hqFS)\n\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/7ScVptN/123.png)\n\n# What makes it unique?\n\nSome libraries aim to give as much as they can out of the box but they faill when it comes to customization and performance. Our goal was to enable as much as possible out of the box but with primary focus on ability to customize any aspect of the components.\n\nWith SfUI you can change almost every aspect of provided components and use them to make stunning eCommerce shops (and not only)!\n\n\n**Here are the key characteristics of Storefront UI:**\n\nWe are building Storefront UI based on the following 6 fundamentals:\n- **Customization**: Along with standard prop-based customization, every component has a set of slots that let you replace any part of it with your own images, icons or even custom HTML markup. You can also customize whole library from a single SCSS file by overriding set of variables. In addition, every component is divided into separate HTML, CSS and JS files so you can compose your own components from it\'s partsupdate docs.\n- **Mobile-first**: Every Storefront UI component is highly optimized for mobile user experience and in many cases behaves completely different on desktop and mobile. Select list becomes full-screen drop-down, tabs are becoming accordion etc.\n- **Performance**: You\xe2\x80\x99re importing ONLY what you need, and in a raw format which means you can benefit from all build-time optimizations like tree shaking or grouping common chunks. Unused components are treeshaked and global CSS is just < 0,1 kB unminified. Thanks to this initial footprint of the library is unnoticable. You can use the library for how many components you want, even a single slider. You bundle only what you import.\n- **Best practices**: Storefront UI components follow best practices in terms of design and core. Every component is based on the Google Retail UX Playbook and is accessibility-friendly.\n- **E-commerce**: As a UI library dedicated to eCommerce, Storefront UI along with standard UI components has all the elements necessary for building modern online stores.\n- **Open Source**: Storefront UI is a community effort to deliver the best possible experience to modern web applications and e-commerce shops, with carefully crafted components following best practices. Our team consists of agencies and volunteer contributors from all over the world.\n\nStorefront UI is based on atomic design which means every component is built from tiny atoms that you can use in your application! You\xe2\x80\x99re not limited to big UI components anymore. Use Storefront UI atoms to quickly build your own, great-looking components!\n\n\nRea [how it can be customized](./docs/customization.md).\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/7SKbz5K/123457.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/VHTcyrw/1234.png)\n\n# Design\n\nYou can find the stunning designs we are using for Storefront UI components [here](https://www.figma.com/file/hrwE3VsMBHgdJoS86rVr4W/Desktop-%26-Mobile-Vue-Storefront?node-id=99%3A0)\n\n[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15185752/58185795-06b51900-7cb4-11e9-883f-2571cace575c.png)\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FO6tm9rEdo&feature=youtu.be)\n\n\n# Contributing\n\nWe are currently in a process of building the library.
