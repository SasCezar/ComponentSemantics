b"# Snapdrop \n\n[Snapdrop](https://snapdrop.net): local file sharing in your browser - inspired by Apple's Airdrop.\n\n#### Snapdrop (Version 2) is built with the following awesome technologies:\n* Vanilla HTML5 / ES6 / CSS3  \n* Progressive Web App\n* [WebRTC](http://webrtc.org/)\n* [WebSockets](http://www.websocket.org/) fallback (iDevices don't support WebRTC)\n* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n* [Material Design](https://material.google.com/)\n\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Instructions\n* [Video Instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XN02GkcHUM) (Big thanks to [TheiTeckHq](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_DUzWMb8gZZnAbISQjmAfQ))\n* [idownloadblog](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/12/29/snapdrop/)\n* [thenextweb](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/12/27/snapdrop-is-a-handy-web-based-replacement-for-apples-fiddly-airdrop-file-transfer-tool/)\n* [winboard](http://www.winboard.org/artikel-ratgeber/6253-dateien-vom-desktop-pc-mit-anderen-plattformen-teilen-mit-snapdrop.html)\n* [\xe5\x85\x8d\xe8\xb2\xbb\xe8\xb3\x87\xe6\xba\x90\xe7\xb6\xb2\xe8\xb7\xaf\xe7\xa4\xbe\xe7\xbe\xa4](https://free.com.tw/snapdrop/)\n\n##### What about the connection? Is it a P2P-connection directly from device to device or is there any third-party-server?\nIt uses a P2P connection if WebRTC is supported by the browser. (WebRTC needs a Signaling Server, but it is only used to establish a connection and is not involved in the file transfer).\n\nIf WebRTC isn\xe2\x80\x99t supported (Safari, IE) it uses a Web Sockets fallback for the file transfer. The server connects the clients with each other.  \n\n##### What about privacy? Will files be saved on third-party-servers?\nNone of your files are ever saved on any server. \nSnapdrop doesn't even use a database. If you are curious have a look [at the Server](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/blob/master/server/).\n\n##### Is SnapDrop a fork of ShareDrop?\nNo. ShareDrop is built with Ember. Snapdrop is built with vanilla ES6. \nI wanted to play around with Progressive Web Apps and then I got the idea of a local file sharing app. By doing research on this idea I found and analysed ShareDrop. I liked it and thought about how to improve it.\nShareDrop uses WebRTC only and isn't compatible with Safari browsers. Snapdrop uses a Websocket fallback and some hacks to make Snapdrop work due to the download restrictions on iDevices. \n\n\n### Snapdrop is awesome! How can I support it? \n* [File bugs, give feedback, submit suggestions](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/issues)\n* Share Snapdrop on your social media.\n* [Buy me a cup of coffee](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=R9C5E42UYEQCN)\n* Fix bugs and make a pull request. \n* Do security analysis and suggestions\n\n## Local Development\n[Install docker with docker-compose.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)\n\n```\n    git clone git@github.com:RobinLinus/snapdrop.git\n    cd snapdrop\n    docker-compose up\n```\n\nNow point your browser to http://localhost:8080.\n \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\n## Deployment Notes\nThe client expects the server at http(s)://your.domain/server.\n\nWhen serving the node server behind a proxy the `X-Forwarded-For` header has to be set by the proxy. Otherwise all clients that are served by the proxy will be mutually visible.\n\nBy default the server listens on port 3000.\n\nFor an nginx configuration example see `nginx/default.conf`.\n\n## Licences\n* Thanks to [Mark DiAngelo]() for the [Blop Sound](http://soundbible.com/2067-Blop.html)\n"
