This documentation is not super stable. Post an issue if you find any trouble or something is not clear\n\n- Install Node.js >= 7.4.0 [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)\n\n- Install a Git client. I recommend SourceTree [https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)\n\n- Clone this repository into a folder in your computer [https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/)\n\n- Install the dependencies using NPM or Yarn:\n\n````\nnpm install\n````\n\n- Create a new project in your [Firebase account](http://firebase.google.com)\n\n- Enable at the Email/Password provider in the [Firebase authentication providers](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bigmomo-647f1/authentication/providers)\n\n- Create a file called `.env` in the root of your cloned repository and add the following code. Replace the values with the ones from the project you created in Firebase:\n\n````\nFIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key\nFIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_project.firebaseapp.com\nFIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_firebase_project.firebaseio.com\nFIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_project.appspot.com\n````\n\n- Update the default project value in `.firebaserc`\n\n- If you want some demo data, import `/data/demo-data.json` into your Firebase database\n\n- If you are going to use Firebase storage, you should give read access to everyone, otherwise only the authenticated users will be able to download images or files. In your [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com), replace the rules with these ones:\n\n````\nallow read: if true;\nallow write: if request.auth != null;\n````\n\n- To give a user admin rights, you have to add a field called `level` with the value `5` into a user (using the firebase UI). Once you do that, login into Nekomy with that user and you will see the `admin` link in the sidebar navigation\n\n### Start development server with hot reloading\n\n````\nnpm run dev\n````\n\n### Testing\n\nRun test once\n\n````\nnpm run test\n````\n\nTest watch\n\n````\nnpm run test:watch\n````\n\n### Linting\n\nLinting is using Airbnb Eslint configuration\n\n````\nnpm run lint\n````\n\n### Deploy to production\n\nBuild for production\n\n````\nnpm run build\n````\n\nInstall Firebase tools (if you haven\'t done it yet)\n\n````\nnpm install -g firebase-tools\n````\n\nLogin and init the project\n\n````\nfirebase login\nfirebase init\n````\n\nDeploy to Firebase\n\n````\nfirebase deploy\n````\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nBy contributing your code to Nekomy you grant to the repository owner a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicenseable, transferable license under all of Your relevant intellectual property rights (including copyright, patent, and any other rights), to use, copy, prepare derivative works of, distribute and publicly perform and display the Contributions on any licensing terms, including without limitation: (a) open source licenses like the MIT license; and (b) binary, proprietary, or commercial licenses.
