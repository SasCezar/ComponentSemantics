b"# Pinafore [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nolanlawson/pinafore.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/nolanlawson/pinafore) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/nolanlawson/pinafore.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)\n\nAn alternative web client for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), focused on speed and simplicity.\n\nPinafore is available at [pinafore.social](https://pinafore.social). Beta releases are at [dev.pinafore.social](https://dev.pinafore.social).\n\nSee the [user guide](https://github.com/nolanlawson/pinafore/blob/master/docs/User-Guide.md) for basic usage. See the [admin guide](https://github.com/nolanlawson/pinafore/blob/master/docs/Admin-Guide.md) if Pinafore cannot connect to your instance.\n\nFor updates and support, follow [@pinafore@mastodon.technology](https://mastodon.technology/@pinafore).\n\n## Browser support\n\nPinafore supports the latest versions of the following browsers:\n\n- Chrome\n- Edge\n- Firefox\n- Safari\n\nCompatible versions of each (Opera, Brave, Samsung, etc.) should be fine.\n\n## Goals and non-goals\n\n### Goals\n\n- Support the most common use cases\n- Small page weight\n- Fast even on low-end devices\n- Accessibility\n- Offline support in read-only mode\n- Progressive Web App features\n- Multi-instance support\n- Support latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari\n\n### Secondary / possible future goals\n\n- Support for Pleroma or other non-Mastodon backends\n- Serve as an alternative frontend tied to a particular instance\n- Support for non-English languages (i18n)\n- Offline search\n\n### Non-goals\n\n- Supporting old browsers, proxy browsers, or text-based browsers\n- React Native / NativeScript / hybrid-native version\n- Android/iOS apps (using Cordova or similar)\n- Full functionality with JavaScript disabled\n- Emoji support beyond the built-in system emoji\n- Multi-column support\n- Admin/moderation panel\n- Offline support in read-write mode (would require sophisticated sync logic)\n\n## Building\n\nPinafore requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8+ and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).\n\nTo build Pinafore for production, first install dependencies:\n\n    yarn --production --pure-lockfile\n\nThen build:\n\n    yarn build\n\nThen run:\n\n    PORT=4002 node server.js\n\n### Docker\n\nTo build a Docker image for production:\n\n    docker build .\n    docker run -d -p 4002:4002 [your-image]\n\nNow Pinafore is running at `localhost:4002`.\n\n### Updating\n\nTo keep your version of Pinafore up to date, you can use `git` to check out the latest tag:\n\n    git checkout $(git tag -l | sort -Vr | head -n 1)\n\n### Exporting\n\nPinafore is a static site. When you run `yarn build`, static files will be \nwritten to `__sapper__/export`.\n\nIn theory you could host these static files yourself (e.g. using nginx or Apache), but \nit's not recommended, because:\n\n- You'd have to set the [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) headers yourself,\nwhich are an important security feature.\n- Some routes are dynamic and need to be routed to the correct static file.\n\n## Developing and testing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nolanlawson/pinafore/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for \nhow to run Pinafore in dev mode and run tests.\n\n## Changelog\n\nFor a changelog, see the [GitHub releases](http://github.com/nolanlawson/pinafore/releases/).\n\nFor a list of breaking changes, see [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](https://github.com/nolanlawson/pinafore/blob/master/BREAKING_CHANGES.md).\n\n## What's with the name?\n\nPinafore is named after the [Gilbert and Sullivan play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hms_pinafore). The [soundtrack](https://www.allmusic.com/album/gilbert-sullivan-hms-pinafore-1949-mw0001830483) is very good.\n"
