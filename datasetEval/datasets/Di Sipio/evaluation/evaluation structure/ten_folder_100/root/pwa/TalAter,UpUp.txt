b'### UpUp - Kickstarting the Offline First Revolution\n<a href="https://www.talater.com/upup/"><img align="right" src="https://github.com/TalAter/UpUp/raw/master/demo/img/upup-readme.gif" alt="Offline First with UpUp"></a>\n\nUpUp is a tiny JavaScript library that makes sure your users can always access your site\'s content, even when they\'re on a plane, in an elevator, or 20,000 leagues under the sea.\n\nMobile-First has become the de-facto standard for building modern sites. But in a world where everyone is mobile, an always-on connection isn\'t something we can rely on. It\'s time to start thinking **Offline First**.\n\nWith UpUp you control the content your users see, even when they are offline. And you can do it with just a single JavaScript command.\n\n### Demo & Tutorial\nThe easiest path to understanding, is to see [UpUp in action, and try a quick tutorial](https://www.talater.com/upup/).\n\n### Hello World\nGetting started with UpUp is as easy as adding two JavaScript files to your site, [upup.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TalAter/UpUp/master/dist/upup.min.js) & [upup.sw.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TalAter/UpUp/master/dist/upup.sw.min.js), and defining the content you want your users to see when they are offline.\n\nFor example:\n````html\n<script src="/upup.min.js"></script>\n<script>\nUpUp.start({\n  \'content-url\': \'offline.html\',\n  \'assets\': [\'/img/logo.png\', \'/css/style.css\', \'headlines.json\']\n});\n</script>\n````\nNow every time your users return to your site and their connection is down, they will see the contents of `offline.html` instead of an error.\n\n**Check out some [live demos and a full tutorial](https://www.talater.com/upup/). Once you\'re up and rolling, you can read the full [API Docs](https://github.com/TalAter/UpUp/blob/master/docs/README.md).**\n\n### HTTPS Requirement\nUpUp requires a secure connection to your site (this is a requirement of service workers, the technology at the heart of UpUp). So make sure your users visit your site over HTTPS (an SSL certificate is free with [Let\xe2\x80\x99s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) or via CloudFlare).\n\n### Browser Support\nUpUp works in any browser that supports service workers. Currently this means:\n* Chrome 40+\n* Opera 27+\n* Firefox 41+\n\nIf your users are using a different or older browser, they will simply be unaffected by UpUp. Nothing will break, and they simply won\'t notice anything different.\n\n### Technical Documentation and API\n[Docs and full API reference](https://github.com/TalAter/UpUp/blob/master/docs/README.md)\n\n### Author\nTal Ater: [@TalAter](https://twitter.com/TalAter)\n\n### License\nLicensed under [MIT](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang/blob/master/LICENSE).\n'
