Only 2k gzipped!\n\n<img src='gifs/demo.gif' width='200'>\n\nThis library aims to provide a highly configurable, ready-to-use sliding menu for your next web application, while delivering native-like animation performance. It was created by the [OSREC Technologies](https://`OSREC.co.uk) while developing [Bx, our invoicing, time-tracking and project management PWA](https://usebx.com).\n\n# Installation\n\n```\nnpm install superslide.js\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nReference the library in a script tag\n```html\n<script src='superslide.js'></script>\n```\nAdd basic HTML markup\n```html\n<body>\n  <div id='content'>Content</div>\n  <div id='menu'>Menu</div>\n</body>\n```\nAdd styles (so we can see what's going on!)\n```html\n<style>\n  body     { padding: 0px; margin: 0px; }\n  #menu    { background: #ccc; }\n  #content { min-height: 100vh; min-width: 100vw; }\n</style>\n```\nInitialise the menu\n```js\nvar myMenu = new OSREC.superslide\n({\n    slider: document.getElementById('menu'),\n    content: document.getElementById('content'),\n    animation: 'slideLeft'\n});\n\n// Promise resolves once menu is open\nvar openPromise = myMenu.open();\n```\n\n**[Try the demo here](https://osrec.github.io/SuperSlide.js/demo.html)**\n\n# Animations\n\nStandard Version has 4 animation options available:\n\n| slideLeft | slideRight | slideBottom | slideTop |\n|--|--|--|--|\n|<img src='gifs/slideLeft.webm.gif' width='80'>|<img src='gifs/slideRight.webm.gif' width='80'>|<img src='gifs/slideBottom.webm.gif' width='80'>|<img src='gifs/slideTop.webm.gif' width='80'>\n\n#### PRO version :star: contains many more menu animations (check it out @ https://osrec.co.uk/products/superslidejs)\n\n# Parameters\n\n- `animation` (`string`): Any of the animations in the animation library (`slideLeft`, `slideRight`, `slideTop`, `slideBottom`).\n\n- `duration` (`integer`):\nDuration in seconds for the slide animation\n\n- `allowDrag` (`boolean`):\nAllow the menu to be dragged into the open or closed position via touch events.\n\n- `slideContent` (`boolean`):\nSlide the content along with the menu\n\n- `allowContentInteraction` (`boolean`):\nAllow the content to be clicked or scrolled while the menu is open\n\n- `closeOnBlur` (`boolean`):\nClose the menu when the user clicks or taps anywhere outside the menu\n\n- `width` (`string`):\nThe width of the menu (for menus that sit along a vertical edge). Examples: '60vw' or '300px' or '80%'\n\n- `height` (`string`):\nThe height of the menu (for menus that sit along a horizontal edge). Examples: '50vh' or '300px' or '80%'\n\n- `dragThreshold` (`integer`):\nThe number of pixels from the edge from where a user can begin dragging; example: 70. Use with the allowDrag option.\n\n- `openThreshold` (`integer`):\nWhen the menu is in the open position, the number of pixels it must be dragged before it opens automatically; example: 30. Use with the allowDrag option.\n\n- `closeThreshold` (`integer`):\nWhen the menu is in the closed position, the number of pixels it must be dragged before it closes automatically; example: 20. Use with the allowDrag option.\n\n- `beforeOpen` (`callback`):\nExecuted before the menu begins to open\n\n- `onOpen` (`callback`):\nExecuted straight after the menu has opened\n\n- `beforeClose` (`callback`):\nExecuted before the menu begins to close\n\n- `onClose` (`callback`):\nExecuted as soon as the menu has closed\n\n# Methods\n\n- `OSREC.superslide.open()`\nOpen the menu.\nReturns a promise that resolves once the menu opens (i.e. animation completes).\n\n- `OSREC.superslide.close()`\nClose the menu.\nReturns a promise that resolves once the menu closes (i.e. animation completes).\n\n- `OSREC.superslide.toggle()`\nToggles the menu.\nReturns a promise that resolves once the menu has been toggled (i.e. animation completes).\n\n- `OSREC.superslide.isOpen()`\nTrue if the menu is open, false if closed. The last state if mid-drag.\nReturns a boolean.\n\n- `OSREC.superslide.ready()`\nCheck if the menu is fully initialised.\nReturns a promise that resolves when fully initialised.\n\n- `OSREC.superslide.destroy()`\nDestroy the menu. This will close the menu if it is open before destroying.\nReturns null\n\n# Credits\n\nCreated by the [Bx team](https://usebx.com) at [OSREC Technologies](https://osrec.co.uk).\n\n![Bx](https://www.usebx.com/web/img/Bx64.png)\n\nThe library was developed as part of our business and project management app called Bx ([you can check it out here](https://usebx.com)).\n"
