Users who want more advanced usage, or want to run Lighthouse in an automated fashion should use the Node CLI.\n\n_Lighthouse requires Node 10 LTS (10.13) or later._\n\n**Installation**:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g lighthouse\n# or use yarn:\n# yarn global add lighthouse\n```\n\n**Run it**: `lighthouse https://airhorner.com/`\n\nBy default, Lighthouse writes the report to an HTML file. You can control the output format by passing flags.\n\n### CLI options\n\n```\n$ lighthouse --help\n\nlighthouse <url>\n\nLogging:\n  --verbose  Displays verbose logging                                                                                                      [boolean]\n  --quiet    Displays no progress, debug logs or errors                                                                                    [boolean]\n\nConfiguration:\n  --save-assets                  Save the trace & devtools log to disk                                                                     [boolean]\n  --list-all-audits              Prints a list of all available audits and exits                                                           [boolean]\n  --list-trace-categories        Prints a list of all required trace categories and exits                                                  [boolean]\n  --print-config                 Print the normalized config for the given config and options, then exit.

Without a value, the default will be `$PWD/latest-run`.\nlighthouse -GA=./gmailartifacts https://gmail.com\n```\n\n\n#### Notes on Error Reporting\n\nThe first time you run the CLI you will be prompted with a message asking you if Lighthouse can anonymously report runtime exceptions. The Lighthouse team uses this information to detect new bugs and avoid regressions. Opting out will not affect your ability to use Lighthouse in any way. [Learn more](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/error-reporting.md).\n\n## Using the Node module\nYou can also use Lighthouse programmatically with the Node module.\n\nRead [Using Lighthouse programmatically](./docs/readme.md#using-programmatically) for help getting started.\\\nRead [Lighthouse Configuration](./docs/configuration.md) to learn more about the configuration options available.\n\n## Viewing a report\n\nLighthouse can produce a report as JSON or HTML.\n\nHTML report:\n\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/443ff2c8a297dfd2297dfaca86c4966a87c8574a/assets/example_audit.png" alt="Lighthouse example audit" width="500px">\n\n### Online Viewer\n\nRunning Lighthouse with the `--output=json` flag generates a JSON dump of the run.\nYou can view this report online by visiting <https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/>\nand dragging the file onto the app. You can also use the "Export" button from the\ntop of any Lighthouse HTML report and open the report in the\n[Lighthouse Viewer](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/).\n\nIn the Viewer, reports can be shared by clicking the share icon in the top\nright corner and signing in to GitHub.\n\n> **Note**: shared reports are stashed as a secret Gist in GitHub, under your account.\n\n## Docs & Recipes\n\nUseful documentation, examples, and recipes to get you started.\n\n**Docs**\n\n- [Dealing with variance](./docs/variability.md)\n- [Using Lighthouse programmatically](./docs/readme.md#using-programmatically)\n- [Testing a site with authentication](./docs/authenticated-pages.md)\n- [Developing Plugins](./docs/plugins.md)\n- [Testing on a mobile device](./docs/readme.md#testing-on-a-mobile-device)\n- [Lighthouse Architecture](./docs/architecture.md)\n\n**Recipes**\n\n- [gulp](docs/recipes/gulp) - helpful for CI integration\n- [Plugin](./docs/recipes/lighthouse-plugin-example) - example Lighthouse plugin\n- [Custom Audit example](./docs/recipes/custom-audit) - extend Lighthouse, run your own audits\n\n**Videos**\n\nThe session from Google I/O 2018 covers the new performance engine, upcoming Lighthouse REST API, and using the Chrome UX report to evaluate real-user data.\n\n[![Lighthouse @ Google I/O 2018](https://img.youtube.com/vi/UvK9zAsSM8Q/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvK9zAsSM8Q)\n\nThe session from Google I/O 2017 covers architecture, writing custom audits,\nGitHub/Travis/CI integration, headless Chrome, and more:\n\n[![Lighthouse @ Google I/O 2017](https://img.youtube.com/vi/NoRYn6gOtVo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoRYn6gOtVo)\n\n_click to watch the video_\n\n## Develop\n\nRead on for the basics of hacking on Lighthouse. Also, see [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfor detailed information.\n\n### Setup\n\n```sh\n# yarn should be installed first\n\ngit clone https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse\n\ncd lighthouse\nyarn\nyarn build-all\n```\n\nIf changing audit output, you\'ll likely also need to have the protocol-buffer compiler installed. See the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation) or consult your [favorite package manager](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/protobuf) for your OS.\n\n### Run\n\n```sh\nnode lighthouse-cli http://example.com\n# append --chrome-flags="--no-sandbox --headless --disable-gpu" if you run into problems connecting to Chrome\n```\n\n> **Getting started tip**: `node --inspect-brk lighthouse-cli http://example.com` to open up Chrome DevTools and step\nthrough the entire app. See [Debugging Node.js with Chrome\nDevTools](https://medium.com/@paul_irish/debugging-node-js-nightlies-with-chrome-devtools-7c4a1b95ae27#.59rma3ukm)\nfor more info.\n\n### Tests\n\n```sh\n# lint and test all files\nyarn test\n\n# watch for file changes and run tests\n#   Requires http://entrproject.org : brew install entr\nyarn watch\n\n## run linting, unit, and smoke tests separately\nyarn lint\nyarn unit\nyarn smoke\n\n## run tsc compiler\nyarn type-check\n```\n\n## Lighthouse Integrations\nThis section details services that have integrated Lighthouse data.

Details in [Lighthouse configuration](./docs/configuration.md).\n\n### How does Lighthouse use network throttling, and how can I make it better?\n\nGood question. Network and CPU throttling are applied by default in a Lighthouse run. The network\nattempts to emulate slow 4G connectivity and the CPU is slowed down 4x from your machine\'s default speed. If you\nprefer to run Lighthouse without throttling, you\'ll have to use the CLI and disable it with the\n`--throttling.*` flags mentioned above.\n\nRead more in our [guide to network throttling](./docs/throttling.md).\n\n### Are results sent to a remote server?\n\nNope. Lighthouse runs locally, auditing a page using a local version of the Chrome browser installed the\nmachine. Report results are never processed or beaconed to a remote server.\n\n### How do I author custom audits to extend Lighthouse?\n\n> **Tip**: see [Lighthouse Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) for more information\non terminology and architecture.\n\nLighthouse can be extended to run custom audits and gatherers that you author.\nThis is great if you\'re already tracking performance metrics in your site and\nwant to surface those metrics within a Lighthouse report.\n\nIf you\'re interested in running your own custom audits, check out our\n[Custom Audit Example](./docs/recipes/custom-audit) over in recipes.\n\n### How do I contribute?\n\nWe\'d love help writing audits, fixing bugs, and making the tool more useful!\nSee [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.\n\n---\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/8b3d7f052b2e64dd857e741d7395647f487697e7/assets/lighthouse-logo.png" alt="Lighthouse logo" height="150">\n  <br>\n  <b>Lighthouse</b>, \xcb\x88l\xc4\xabt\xcb\x8chous (n): a <s>tower or other structure</s> tool containing a beacon light\n  to warn or guide <s>ships at sea</s> developers.\n</p>\n'
