b'Ambassador [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/datawire/ambassador.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/datawire/ambassador) [![Docker Repository](https://quay.io/repository/datawire/ambassador/status "Docker Repository")](https://quay.io/repository/datawire/ambassador) [![Join Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-join-orange.svg)](https://d6e.co/slack)\n==========\n\n[Ambassador](https://www.getambassador.io) is an open source Kubernetes-native API Gateway built on [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io), designed for microservices. Ambassador essentially serves as an Envoy ingress controller, but with many more features.\n\nKey [features](https://www.getambassador.io/features) include:\n\n* Self-service configuration, via Kubernetes annotations\n* Support for [gRPC and HTTP/2](https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/grpc), [TCP](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/tcpmappings), and [WebSockets](https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/websockets-ambassador)\n* Support for CORS, timeouts, weighted round robin ([canary](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/canary)), sticky sessions, [rate limiting](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/services/rate-limit-service)\n* [Consul](https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/consul), Linkerd, and [Istio](https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/with-istio) service mesh integration\n* [Authentication](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/services/auth-service)\n* Robust TLS support, including TLS client-certificate authentication and [SNI](https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/sni)\n* [Knative serverless integration](https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/knative/)\n* Comprehensive [metrics](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/statistics) support\n\nArchitecture\n============\n\nAmbassador deploys the Envoy Proxy for L7 traffic management. Configuration of Ambassador is via Kubernetes annotations. Ambassador relies on Kubernetes for scaling and resilience. For more on Ambassador\'s architecture and motivation, read [this blog post](https://blog.getambassador.io/building-ambassador-an-open-source-api-gateway-on-kubernetes-and-envoy-ed01ed520844).\n\nGetting Started\n===============\n\nYou can get Ambassador up and running in less than a minute by running it locally with Docker. Follow the instructions here: https://www.getambassador.io#get-started.\n\nFor production usage, Ambassador runs in Kubernetes. For a Kubernetes deployment, follow the instructions at https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/getting-started.\n\nIf you are looking for a Kubernetes ingress controller, Ambassador provides a superset of the functionality of a typical ingress controller. (It does the traditional routing, and layers on a raft of configuration options.) This blog post covers [Kubernetes ingress](https://blog.getambassador.io/kubernetes-ingress-nodeport-load-balancers-and-ingress-controllers-6e29f1c44f2d).\n\nYou can also use Helm to install Ambassador. For more information, see the instructions in the [Helm installation documentation](https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/helm).\n\nCommunity\n=========\n\nAmbassador is an open source project, and welcomes any and all contributors. To get started:\n\n* Join our [Slack channel](https://d6e.co/slack)\n* Read the [developer guide](BUILDING.md)\n* Check out the [Ambassador documentation](https://www.getambassador.io/about/why-ambassador)\n\nIf you\'re interested in contributing, here are some ways:\n\n* Write a blog post for [our blog](https://blog.getambassador.io)\n* Investigate an [open issue](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/issues)\n* Add [more tests](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/tree/master/ambassador/tests)\n\nIf you need commercial support or additional features, check out [Ambassador Pro](https://www.getambassador.io/pro/).\n'
