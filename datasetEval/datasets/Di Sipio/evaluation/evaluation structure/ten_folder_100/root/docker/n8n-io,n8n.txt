The list can be found on: [https://n8n.io/nodes](https://n8n.io/nodes)\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe official n8n documentation can be found under: [https://docs.n8n.io](https://docs.n8n.io)\n\nAdditional information and example workflows on the n8n.io website: [https://n8n.io](https://n8n.io)\n\n\n## Usage\n\n- :books: Learn [how to **install** and **use** it from the command line](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/cli/README.md)\n- :whale: Learn [how to run n8n in **Docker**](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/docker/images/n8n/README.md)\n\n\n\n## Start\n\nExecute: `npm run start`\n\n\n\n## Hosted n8n\n\nIf you are interested in a hosted version of n8n on our infrastructure please contact us via:\n[hosting@n8n.io](mailto:hosting@n8n.io)\n\n\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have problems or questions go to our forum, we will then try to help you asap:\n\n[https://community.n8n.io](https://community.n8n.io)\n\n\n\n## What does n8n mean and how do you pronounce it\n\n**Short answer:** It means "nodemation"\n\n**Long answer:** I get that question quite often (more often than I expected)\nso I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a\ngood name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the\ngood ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose\nnodemation. "node-" in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses\nNode.js and "-mation" for "automation" which is what the project is supposed to help with.\nHowever, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing\nsomething that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on\n"n8n". Sure does not work perfectly but does neither for Kubernetes (k8s) and\ndid not hear anybody complain there. So I guess it should be ok.\n\n\n\n## Development Setup\n\nHave you found a bug :bug: ? Or maybe you have a nice feature :sparkles: to contribute ?
