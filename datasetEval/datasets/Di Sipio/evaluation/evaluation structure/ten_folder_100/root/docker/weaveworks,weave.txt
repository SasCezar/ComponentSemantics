b'# Weave Net - Weaving Containers into Applications\n\n[![Integration Tests](https://circleci.com/gh/weaveworks/weave/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/weaveworks/weave)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/weaveworks/weave/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/weaveworks/weave)\n[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/weaveworks/weave)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/weaveworks/weave)\n[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/weaveworks/weave.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://hub.docker.com/r/weaveworks/weave/)\n\n# About Weaveworks\n\n[Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works) is the company that delivers the most productive way for developers to connect, observe and control Docker containers.\n\nThis repository contains [Weave Net](https://www.weave.works/products/weave-net/), the first product developed by Weaveworks, with over 8 million downloads to date. Weave Net enables you to get started with Docker clusters and portable apps in a fraction of the time required by other solutions.\n\n## Weave Cloud:\n\n[Weave Cloud](https://www.weave.works/product/cloud/) is software-as-a-service that simplifies deployment, monitoring and management for containers and microservices. It extends and complements popular orchestrators, and enables developers and DevOps to realize faster deployments, insightful monitoring, visualization and networking.\n\nWeave Cloud is built using these Open Source projects: [Weave Scope](https://www.weave.works/products/weave-scope/), a powerful container visualization tool that automatically maps Docker containers and their interactions, [Weave Cortex](https://github.com/weaveworks/cortex), a horizontally-scalable version of Prometheus, and [Weave Flux](https://www.weave.works/products/weave-flux/), a continuous deployment tool that works with Kubernetes.\n\n# Weave Net\n\nWeave Net creates a virtual network that connects Docker containers across multiple hosts and enables their automatic discovery. With Weave Net, portable microservices-based applications consisting of multiple containers can run anywhere: on one host, multiple hosts or even across cloud providers and data centers. Applications use the network just as if the containers were all plugged into the same network switch, without having to configure port mappings, ambassadors or links.\n\nServices provided by application containers on the Weave network can be exposed to the outside world, regardless of where they are running. Similarly, existing internal systems can be opened to accept connections from application containers irrespective of their location.\n\n## <a name="help"></a>Getting help\n\nIf you have any questions about, feedback for or a problem with Weave Net:\n\n- Read [the Weave Net docs](https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/overview).\n- Invite yourself to the <a href="https://slack.weave.works/" target="_blank">Weave Users Slack</a>.\n- Ask a question on the [#net-dev](https://weave-community.slack.com/messages/net-dev/) slack channel.\n- Join the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/Weave/"> Weave User Group </a> and get invited to online talks, hands-on training and meetups in your area.\n- [File an issue](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues/new).\n\nYour feedback is always welcome!\n\n## Further Information\n\n* [Installing Weave Net](https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/install/installing-weave)\n* [Weave Net Product Overview](https://www.weave.works/products/weave-net)\n'
