Giving your code access to Services in a remote Kubernetes cluster.\n2. Giving your code access to cloud resources like AWS RDS or Google PubSub.\n3. Allowing Kubernetes to access your code as if it were in a normal pod within the cluster.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. [Install locally](https://www.telepresence.io/reference/install) with Homebrew, apt, or dnf.\n\n2. Run `telepresence`.\n\n3. You now have a shell that proxies connections to Kubernetes.\n\nFor more about Telepresence, and the various options, [read the documentation](https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview).\n\n## Usage Reporting\n\nTelepresence collects some basic information about its users so it can send important client notices, such as new version availability and security bulletins. We also use the information to aggregate basic usage analytics anonymously. To disable this behavior set the environment variable `SCOUT_DISABLE`:\n\n    export SCOUT_DISABLE=1\n\nTo know more, check the [documentation](https://www.telepresence.io/reference/usage_reporting) on usage reporting.\n\n## About Telepresence\n\nTelepresence is an open source project hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io) and originally created by [Datawire](https://www.datawire.io).
