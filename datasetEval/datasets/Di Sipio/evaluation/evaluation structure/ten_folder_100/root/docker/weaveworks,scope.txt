Easily identify and correct issues to ensure the stability and performance of your containerized applications.\n\n### Contextual details and deep linking\n\n<img src="imgs/selected.png" width="200" alt="Focus on a single container" align="right">\n\nView contextual metrics, tags, and metadata for your containers.  Effortlessly navigate between processes inside your container to hosts your containers run on, arranged in expandable, sortable tables.  Easily find the container using the most CPU or memory for a given host or service.\n\n### Interact with and manage containers\n\n<img src="imgs/terminals.png" width="200" alt="Launch a command line." align="right">\n\nInteract with your containers directly: pause, restart, and stop containers. Launch a command line. All without leaving the scope browser window.\n\n### Extend and customize via plugins\n\nAdd custom details or interactions for your hosts, containers, and/or processes by creating Scope plugins. Or, just choose from some that others have already written at the GitHub [Weaveworks Scope Plugins](https://github.com/weaveworks-plugins/) organization.\n\n## Who is using Scope in production\n\n- [Apester](https://apester.com/)\n- [MayaData](https://mayadata.io/) in [MayaOnline / MayaOnPrem](https://mayadata.io/products)\n- [Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works/) in [Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works)\n\nIf you would like to see your name added, let us know on Slack, or send a PR please.\n\n## <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started\n\n**Ensure your computer is behind a firewall that blocks port 4040** then,\n\n```console\nsudo curl -L git.io/scope -o /usr/local/bin/scope\nsudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/scope\nscope launch\n```\n\nThis script downloads and runs a recent Scope image from Docker Hub.\nNow, open your web browser to **http://localhost:4040**.\n\nFor instructions on installing Scope on [Kubernetes](https://www.weave.works/docs/scope/latest/installing/#k8s), [DCOS](https://www.weave.works/docs/scope/latest/installing/#dcos), or [ECS](https://www.weave.works/docs/scope/latest/installing/#ecs), see [the docs](https://www.weave.works/docs/scope/latest/introducing/).\n\n## <a name="help"></a>Reach Out\n\nWe are a very friendly community and love questions, help and feedback.\n\nIf you have any questions, feedback, or problems with Scope:\n\n- Docs\n  - Read [the Weave Scope docs](https://www.weave.works/docs/scope/latest/introducing/)\n  - Check out the [frequently asked questions](/site/faq.md)\n  - Learn more about how the [Scope community operates](GOVERNANCE.md)\n- Join the discussion\n  - Invite yourself to the <a href="https://slack.weave.works/" target="_blank">Weave community</a> Slack\n  - Ask a question on the [#scope](https://weave-community.slack.com/messages/scope/) Slack channel\n  - Send an email to [Scope community group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scope-community)\n- Meetings and events\n  - Join the [Weave User Group](https://www.meetup.com/pro/Weave/) and get invited to online talks, hands-on training and meetups in your area\n  - Join (and read up on) the regular [Scope community meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/103_60TuEkfkhz_h2krrPJH8QOx-vRnPpbcCZqrddE1s/edit)\n- Contributing\n  - Find out how to [contribute to Scope](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n  - [File an issue](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/issues/new) or make a pull request for one of our [good first issues](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-issue)\n\nYour feedback is always welcome!\n\n## License\nScope is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
