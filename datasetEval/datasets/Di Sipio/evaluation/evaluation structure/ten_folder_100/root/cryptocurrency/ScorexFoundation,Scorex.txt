b'Scorex 2 - The modular blockchain framework [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ScorexFoundation/Scorex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ScorexFoundation/Scorex) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/ScorexFoundation/Scorex/badge.svg?branch=scoverage-reports)](https://coveralls.io/github/ScorexFoundation/Scorex?branch=scoverage-reports)\n====================================================================================================================================================================================\n\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/input-output-hk/Scorex](https://badges.gitter.im/input-output-hk/Scorex.svg)](https://gitter.im/input-output-hk/Scorex?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\nScorex and Scorex 2\n-------------------\n\nIt is experimental and still raw new major release of the Scorex. Previous\nversion with documentation could be found at [https://github.com/input-output-hk/Scorex](https://github.com/input-output-hk/Scorex).\n\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\n Bitcoin Core source code contains more 100K lines of code(80K of C++ only), Nxt is more than 45K\n line of Java code. All parts of the design(network/transactional/consensus protocols) are mixed in a hard way.\n So researchers and developers are not in good start positions to make experiments.\n\n In opposite, Scorex core is less than 4K lines of Scala code. Abstract core concepts allow to implement a broad range\n of systems, including ones with multiple types of blocks and non-linear history.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Compact, functional code\n* Modular design with fine granularity\n* Scala language\n* Asynchronous network layer on top of TCP\n* JSON API\n* Command line client for the JSON API\n* Cryptographic primitives externalized into [separate scrypto framework](https://github.com/input-output-hk/scrypto)\n* Few examples out-of-box\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n[Please refer to the tutorial](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/ScorexTutorial)\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThere are two examples of blockchain systems built with Scorex. Details are available in \nthe [dedicated readme](examples/README.md).\n\n\n\nContributions\n-------------\n\nContributions are welcome! Please take a look into [issues](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/ScorexTutorial/issues).\n Testing codebase is very small at the moment, so writing a test is not just good for start, but useful for the product as well.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nTo the extent possible under law, the authors have dedicated all copyright and related and neighboring\nrights to this software to the public domain worldwide.
