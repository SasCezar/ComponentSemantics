It utilizes the [LBRY blockchain](https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd) as a global namespace and database of digital content. Blockchain entries contain searchable content metadata, identities, rights and access rules. LBRY also provides a data network that consists of peers (seeders) uploading and downloading data from other peers, possibly in exchange for payments, as well as a distributed hash table used by peers to discover other peers.\n\nLBRY SDK for Python is currently the most fully featured implementation of the LBRY Network protocols and includes many useful components and tools for building decentralized applications. Primary features and components include:\n\n * Built on Python 3.7+ and `asyncio`.\n * Kademlia DHT (Distributed Hash Table) implementation for finding peers to download from and announcing to peers what we have to host ([lbry.dht](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk/tree/master/lbry/lbry/dht)).\n * Blob exchange protocol for transferring encrypted blobs of content and negotiating payments ([lbry.blob_exchange](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk/tree/master/lbry/lbry/blob_exchange)).\n * Protobuf schema for encoding and decoding metadata stored on the blockchain ([lbry.schema](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk/tree/master/lbry/lbry/schema)).\n * Wallet implementation for the LBRY blockchain ([lbry.wallet](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk/tree/master/lbry/lbry/wallet)).\n * Daemon with a JSON-RPC API to ease building end user applications in any language and for automating various tasks ([lbry.extras.daemon](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk/tree/master/lbry/lbry/extras/daemon)). \n\n## Installation\n\nOur [releases page](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk/releases) contains pre-built binaries of the latest release, pre-releases, and past releases for macOS, Debian-based Linux, and Windows. [Automated travis builds](http://build.lbry.io/daemon/) are also available for testing.\n\n## Usage\n\nRun `lbrynet start` to launch the API server.\n\nBy default, `lbrynet` will provide a JSON-RPC server at `http://localhost:5279`. It is easy to interact with via cURL or sane programming languages.\n\nOur [quickstart guide](https://lbry.tech/playground) provides a simple walkthrough and examples for learning.\n\nWith the daemon running, `lbrynet commands` will show you a list of commands.\n\nThe full API is documented [here](https://lbry.tech/api/sdk).\n\n## Running from source\n\nInstalling from source is also relatively painless. Full instructions are in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to this project are welcome, encouraged, and compensated.
