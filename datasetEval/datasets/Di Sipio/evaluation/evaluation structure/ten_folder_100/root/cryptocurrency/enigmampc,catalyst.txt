Catalyst also supports\nlive-trading of crypto-assets starting with four exchanges (Binance, Bitfinex, Bittrex,\nand Poloniex) with more being added over time. Catalyst empowers users to share \nand curate data and build profitable, data-driven investment strategies. Please \nvisit `catalystcrypto.io <https://www.catalystcrypto.io>`_ to learn more about Catalyst.\n\nCatalyst builds on top of the well-established \n`Zipline <https://github.com/quantopian/zipline>`_ project. We did our best to \nminimize structural changes to the general API to maximize compatibility with \nexisting trading algorithms, developer knowledge, and tutorials. Join us on the \n`Catalyst Forum <https://forum.catalystcrypto.io/>`_ for questions around Catalyst,\nalgorithmic trading and technical support. We also have a \n`Discord <https://discord.gg/SJK32GY>`_ group with the *#catalyst_dev* and \n*#catalyst_setup* dedicated channels.\n\nOverview\n========\n\n-  Ease of use: Catalyst tries to get out of your way so that you can \n   focus on algorithm development.
