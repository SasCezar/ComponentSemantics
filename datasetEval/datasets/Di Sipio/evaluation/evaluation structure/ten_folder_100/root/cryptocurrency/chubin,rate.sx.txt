b"\n*rate.sx* \xe2\x80\x94 console service for exploring (crypto)currencies exchange rates\n\n## Features\n\n* realtime\xc2\xb9 currencies and cryptocurrencies exchange rates information\n* (crypto)currencies converter and calculator\n* historical\xc2\xb2 exchange rates graphical representation\n* clean, concise and very fast\xc2\xb3 interface\n* available everywhere, no installation needed\n\n## Usage\n\nTo get information about current exchange rates and market capitalization\nof the top ten cryptocoins in shell:\n\n```\n  $ curl rate.sx\n```\n\n![rate.sx screenshot](http://rate.sx/files/screenshot.png)\n\nBy default, all rates are represented in USD.\nTo use some other currency, specify it in the domain name (lower-, upper- or mixed-case):\n\n```\n  $ curl eur.rate.sx\n```\n\nAlso, you can use rate.sx as *(crypto)currency converter/calculator*.\nTo convert some amount of (crypto)currencies into other (crypto)currency, \nyou have to specify the amount in the query line, after `rate.sx/`.\n\nFor example, to convert 10 Bitcoins (BTC) into US Dollars do:\n\n```\n  $ curl rate.sx/10BTC\n```\n\nYou can also combine different currencies and cryptocurrencies in the same query:\n\n```\n  $ curl eur.rate.sx/1BTC+1BCH+1BTG       # convert sum of the Bitcoins (BTC, BCH and BTG) into Euro (EUR)\n  $ curl rub.rate.sx/100ETH               # convert 100 ETH into Russian ruble (RUB)\n  $ curl rate.sx/1BTC-10ETH               # compare what is more: 1 BTC or 10 ETH\n```\n\nTo show how cryptocurrency exchange rate was changing in time, \nspecify name of the cryptocurrency in the URL.\n\nFor example, for Ethereum (ETH):\n\n```\n  $ curl rate.sx/eth\n```\n\nBy default, data for the last 24 hours is displayed, but you can specify\nany\xc2\xb3 other interval, using the `@range` notation (more on it below, in the *Interval specification* section).\n\n![rate.sx screenshot with plot](http://rate.sx/files/screenshot-with-plot.png)\n\nTo display output in some other currency (USD is used by default) or to compare a cryptocurrency\nwith another cryptocurrency, specify it in the domain name or after `/` in the query:\n\n```\n  $ curl rate.sx/eth@30d                # Ethereum to USD rate for the last 30 days\n  $ curl eur.rate.sx/btc@february       # How Bitcoin (BTC) price in EUR changed in February\n  $ curl xlm.rate.sx/xrp@01-Feb-2018..  # Is it true that 1 XRP (Ripple) costs 3 XLM (Stellar) since Feb 1?\n```\n\nThe time interval can be specified in many various ways. Though, most of them are intuitively clear,\nconsult the Interval specification section just to see what interval formats are supported.\n\nYou can the service in a web browser (though it is not its primary user interface),\njust type rate.sx in the location bar for that.\n\n\n## Supported currencies and cryptocurrencies\n\nYou can find actual list of the supported currencies in `/:currencies` and cryptocurrencies in `/:coins`.\n32 different currencies and 500 most popular crypto currencies are supported at the moment.\n\n## Options\n\nFor the list of all supported options see `/:help`:\n\n```\n  $ curl rate.sx/:help\n```\n\nThe most important options:\n\n    n=NUMBER            number of cryptocurrencies to show (10 by default)\n\nOptions are specified after the ? sign in the URL.\nThey can be separated using the `&` sign (don't forget to escape or to quote it in the shell, because\nit is a special shell symbol).\n\n```\n  $ curl btc.rate.sx/?n=30\n```\n\n## Interval specification\n\nWhen showing exchange rates historical data, data for the last 24 hours is displayed by default.\nTo use other time interval you have to specify it in the url after coin name, separated with the `@` sign.\n\nFor example, to get info for the last 4 days, add `@4d`:\n\n```\n $  curl rate.sx/eth@4d\n```\n\nThe following time intervals specfiers are supported:\n\n```\n    s   Second\n    m   Minute\n    h   Hour\n    d   Day (24 hours)\n    w   Week\n    M   Month (30 days)\n    y   Year (365 days)\n```\n\nThe specifiers *have to* be prefixed with an integer number (even if it is equal to 1)\nand can be combined together:\n\n```\n    10d     # 10 days\n    2w4d    # 2 weeks and 4 days\n    1h30m   # 1 hour and 30 minutes\n```\n\nIn all these cases you specify the starting point of the interval, and the end is always the current time.\nThat means, that information for the last time is shown.\n\nYou can specify some range in the past. There are three options for that:\n\n1. You specify the starting and the stopping date (and/or if needed time) separated with `..` (the stopping date can be omited):\n\n```\n    10d..5d                     # from 10 days ago to 5 days ago\n    2018-01-10..2018-01-20      # from 2018-01-10 to 2018-01-20\n    2018-03-15+12:00..          # from 2018-03-15 12:00 till now\n```\n\n2. You specify the starting (or stopping) date/time and the delta separated with `+`, `-` or `+-`:\n\n```\n    2018-03-01+-3d              # March 01 and +- 3 days around it\n    2018-03-15+1w      \t\t\t# one week starting from 2018-03-15\n    2018-03-25-2w          \t\t# two weeks to 2018-03-25\n```\n\n3. You can specify some time range, and rate.sx try to guess what do you mean:\n\n```\n    February                    # the whole February (this year)\n    02-Feb                      # the whole day, February 2 (this year)\n    \xd0\x9c\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x82                        # you can even use other languages (\xd0\x9c\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x82 is March in Russian)\n```\n\nDon't afraid to be too inventive. If rate.sx can't parse your date, it will say about it.\nThe toplevel intrval grammar is summarized below.\n\n![rate.sx screenshot with plot and interval](http://rate.sx/files/screenshot-with-plot-and-interval.png)\n*In this output, exchange rate of IOTA (MIOTA) to Euro (EUR) in March 2018 is displayed.*\n\nInterval specifications grammar:\n\n```\n    LENGTH\n    DATETIME\n    DATETIME..[DATETIME]\n    DATETIME+LENGTH\n    DATETIME-LENGTH\n    DATETIME+-LENGTH\n```\n\n## Output units\n\nBy default, rate.sx shows rates of cryptocurrencies to USD (or any other currency if it is\nspecified in the query as show above). It is possible to use a crypto currency as the unit.\nKeep in mind, that in the changes columns (and in the sparklines) difference to the historical\nrates is displayed, and not to the current rate. That is obviously the reason why spark \nfor the rate currency to the same currency is always 1 (and change is 0).\n\nThis mode can be used to compare some cryptocurrency with the rest.\nSay, if we want to see, what cryptocurrencies are falling not so fast comparing \nto BTC (picture is done during the January 2018 correction):\n\n![btc.rate.sx/?n=30](http://rate.sx/files/ratesx-n30.png)\n\nWe see here that nothing (except ARDR) from the top 30 (because we use `?n=30` here)\nis falling slower than BTC (USDT is obviously an exception).\nIf we would use normal USD/EUR/GBP output, we could not find this out (at least not instantly).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThough *rate.sx* synchronizes with online cryptocurrencies exchanges every five minutes,\nwe cannot guarantee absolute accuracy of the displayed exchange rates.\nYou should always confirm current rates before making any transactions\nthat could be affected by changes in the exchange rates.\nCrypocurrency rates based on the data provided by exchanges APIs.\nAll rates are for information purposes only and are subject to change without prior notice.\nSince rates for actual transactions may vary,\nwe are not offering to enter into any transaction at any rate displayed.\nDisplayed rates are composite prices and not intended to be used for investment purposes. \n\n## Integration\n\n### GNU Emacs\n\n[rate-sx.el](https://github.com/davep/rate-sx.el) \xe2\x80\x94 rate.sx in Emacs (courtesy of Dave Pearson @davep)\n\n![rate-sx.el screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28237/33782065-1569d88e-dc4f-11e7-9547-c9e14dcfd470.png)\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. Data update interval is 5 minutes (300 seconds)\n2. Historical data covers the range starting on 07 Jan 2018\n3. 99.9% of all queries are processed within 150ms\n\n## rate.sx Server Installation\n\nIf you want to install the *rate.sx* server, you can do it. Keep in mind that you need some data \ndatasource. A server without data is useless (of course, you can always\nuse rate.sx as the datasource, though the point of such a strange configuration is not clear).\n\n### Install rate.sx server\n\n```\ngit clone github.com/chubin/rate.sx\ncd rate.sx\nvirtualenv ve\nve/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt\nve/bin/python bin/srv.py\n\n```\n\n### Configure HTTP-frontend service\n\nConfigure the web server, that will be used to access the service (if you want to use a web frontend; it's recommended):\n\n```\nserver {\n    listen [::]:80;\n    server_name  rate.sx *.rate.sx;\n    access_log  /var/log/nginx/rate.sx-access.log  main;\n    error_log  /var/log/nginx/rate.sx-error.log;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8003;\n\n        proxy_set_header   Host             $host;\n        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For  $remote_addr;\n\n        client_max_body_size       10m;\n        client_body_buffer_size    128k;\n\n        proxy_connect_timeout      90;\n        proxy_send_timeout         90;\n        proxy_read_timeout         90;\n\n        proxy_buffer_size          4k;\n        proxy_buffers              4 32k;\n        proxy_busy_buffers_size    64k;\n        proxy_temp_file_write_size 64k;\n\n        expires                    off;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n"
