Many characteristics are still undefined but the following constitutes a first set of choices:\n\n  * Clean and minimal implementation, and aiming to stay as such.\n  * Follows the Mimblewimble protocol, which provides hidden amounts and scaling advantages.\n  * Cuckoo Cycle proof of work in two variants named Cuckaroo (ASIC-resistant) and Cuckatoo (ASIC-targeted).\n  * Relatively fast block time: one minute.\n  * Fixed block reward over time with a decreasing dilution.\n  * Transaction fees are based on the number of Outputs created/destroyed and total transaction size.\n  * Smooth curve for difficulty adjustments.\n\nTo learn more, read our [introduction to Mimblewimble and Grin](doc/intro.md).\n\n## Status\n\nGrin is live with mainnet. Still, much is left to be done and [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome (see below). Check our [mailing list archives](https://lists.launchpad.net/mimblewimble/) for the latest status.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo get involved, read our [contributing docs](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nFind us:\n\n* Chat: [Gitter](https://gitter.im/grin_community/Lobby).\n* Mailing list: join the [~Mimblewimble team](https://launchpad.net/~mimblewimble) and subscribe on Launchpad.\n* Twitter for the Grin council: [@grincouncil](https://twitter.com/grincouncil)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo learn more about the technology, read our [introduction](doc/intro.md).\n\nTo build and try out Grin, see the [build docs](doc/build.md).\n\n## Philosophy\n\nGrin likes itself small and easy on the eyes. It wants to be inclusive and welcoming for all walks of life, without judgement. Grin is terribly ambitious, but not at the detriment of others, rather to further us all. It may have strong opinions to stay in line with its objectives, which doesn't mean disrespect of others' ideas.\n\nWe believe in pull requests, data and scientific research. We do not believe in unfounded beliefs.\n\n## Credits\n\nTom Elvis Jedusor for the first formulation of Mimblewimble.\n\nAndrew Poelstra for his related work and improvements.\n\nJohn Tromp for the Cuckoo Cycle proof of work.\n\nJ.K. Rowling for making it despite extraordinary adversity.\n\n## License\n\nApache License v2.0.\n"
