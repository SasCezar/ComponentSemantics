However, for production backend deployments you should definitely be\n> using `ed25519`. If `ed25519` is successfully installed and working\n> `StellarSdk.FastSigning` variable will be equal `true`. Otherwise it will be\n> `false`.\n\n## Quick start\n\nUsing npm to include js-stellar-sdk in your own project:\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save stellar-sdk\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use jsDelivr or cdnjs in a browser\n\n```html\n<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/stellar-sdk@latest/lib/index.min.js"></script>\n````\n\n## Install\n\n### To use as a module in a Node.js project\n\n1. Install it using npm:\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save stellar-sdk\n```\n\n2. require/import it in your JavaScript:\n\n```js\nvar StellarSdk = require(\'stellar-sdk\');\n```\n\n#### Help! I\'m having trouble installing the SDK on Windows\n\nUnfortunately, the Stellar platform development team mostly works on OS X and\nLinux, and so sometimes bugs creep through that are specific to windows. When\ninstalling stellar-sdk on windows, you might see an error that looks similar to\nthe following:\n\n```shell\nerror MSB8020: The build tools for v120 (Platform Toolset = \'v120 \') cannot be found. To build using the v120 build tools, please install v120 build tools.  Alternatively, you may upgrade to the current Visual Studio tools by selecting the Project menu or right-click the solution, and then selecting "Retarget solution"\n```\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should upgrade your version of nodejs, node-gyp and\nthen re-attempt to install the offending package using\n`npm install -g --msvs_version=2015 ed25519`. Afterwards, retry installing\nstellar-sdk as normal.\n\nIf you encounter the error: "failed to find C:\\OpenSSL-Win64", You need to\ninstall OpenSSL. More information about this issue can be found\n[here](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/wiki/Linking-to-OpenSSL).\n\nIn the event the above does not work, please join us on our community slack to\nget help resolving your issue.\n\n### To self host for use in the browser\n\n1. Install it using [bower](http://bower.io):\n\n```shell\nbower install stellar-sdk\n```\n\n2. Include it in the browser:\n\n```html\n<script src="./bower_components/stellar-sdk/stellar-sdk.js"></script>\n<script>\n  console.log(StellarSdk);\n</script>\n```\n\nIf you don\'t want to use install Bower, you can copy built JS files from the\n[bower-js-stellar-sdk repo](https://github.com/stellar/bower-js-stellar-sdk).\n\n### To use the [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/stellar-sdk) hosted script in the browser\n\n1. Instruct the browser to fetch the library from\n   [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/stellar-sdk), a 3rd party service that\n   hosts js libraries:\n\n```html\n<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/stellar-sdk/{version}/stellar-sdk.js"></script>\n<script>\n  console.log(StellarSdk);\n</script>\n```\n\nNote that this method relies using a third party to host the JS library. This\nmay not be entirely secure.\n\nMake sure that you are using the latest version number. They can be found on the\n[releases page in Github](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/releases).\n\n### To develop and test js-stellar-sdk itself\n\n1. Clone the repo:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk.git\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies inside js-stellar-sdk folder:\n\n```shell\ncd js-stellar-sdk\nnpm install\n```\n\n3. Install Node 10.16.3\n\nBecause we support earlier versions of Node, please install and develop on Node\n10.16.3 so you don\'t get surprised when your code works locally but breaks in CI.\n\nHere\'s out to install `nvm` if you haven\'t: https://github.com/creationix/nvm\n\n```shell\nnvm install\n\n# if you\'ve never installed 10.16.3 before you\'ll want to re-install yarn\nnpm install -g yarn\n```\n\nIf you work on several projects that use different Node versions, you might it\nhelpful to install this automatic version manager:\nhttps://github.com/wbyoung/avn\n\n4. Observe the project\'s code style\n\nWhile you\'re making changes, make sure to run the linter-watcher to catch any\n   linting errors (in addition to making sure your text editor supports ESLint)\n\n```shell\nnode_modules/.bin/gulp watch\n````\n\nIf you\'re working on a file not in `src`, limit your code to Node 6.16 ES! See\nwhat\'s supported here: https://node.green/ (The reason is that our npm library\nmust support earlier versions of Node, so the tests need to run on those\nversions.)\n\n### How to use with React-Native\n\n1. Add the following postinstall script:\n```\nyarn rn-nodeify --install url,events,https,http,util,stream,crypto,vm,buffer --hack --yarn\n```\n2. `yarn add -D rn-nodeify`\n3. Uncomment `require(\'crypto\')` on shim.js\n4. `react-native link react-native-randombytes`\n5. Create file `rn-cli.config.js`\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  resolver: {\n    extraNodeModules: require("node-libs-react-native"),\n  },\n};\n```\n6. Add `import "./shim";` to the top of `index.js`\n7. `yarn add stellar-sdk`\n\nThere is also a [sample](https://github.com/fnando/rn-stellar-sdk-sample) that you can follow.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nFor information on how to use js-stellar-sdk, take a look at the\n[Developers site](https://www.stellar.org/developers/js-stellar-sdk/reference/).\n\nThere is also API Documentation\n[here](https://www.stellar.org/developers/reference/).\n\n## Testing\n\nTo run all tests:\n\n```shell\ngulp test\n```\n\nTo run a specific set of tests:\n\n```shell\ngulp test:node\ngulp test:browser\n```\n\nTo generate and check the documentation site:\n\n```shell\n# install the `serve` command if you don\'t have it already\nnpm install -g serve\n\n# generate the docs files\nnpm run docs\n\n# get these files working in a browser\ncd jsdoc && serve .\n\n# you\'ll be able to browse the docs at http://localhost:5000\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this repo lives in\n[Developers site](https://www.stellar.org/developers/js-stellar-sdk/reference/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nFor information on how to contribute, please refer to our\n[contribution guide](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Publishing to npm\n\n```\nnpm version [<newversion> | major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease]\n```\n\nA new version will be published to npm **and** Bower by Travis CI.\n\nnpm >=2.13.0 required.
