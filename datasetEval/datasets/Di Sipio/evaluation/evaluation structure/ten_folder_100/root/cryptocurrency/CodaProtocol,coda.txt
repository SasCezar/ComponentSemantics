This is the main source code repository for the Coda project. It contains code for the OCaml protocol implementation, [website](https://codaprotocol.com), and wallet. Enjoy!\n\n## Notes\n\n- Coda is still under active development, and APIs are still evolving. If you do build upon the APIs, be aware that breaking changes may occur.\n- There is a live testnet of the Coda protocol currently running - [sign up here to join the testnet](http://bit.ly/TestnetForm).\n\n## What is Coda?\n\n### Coda Walkthrough\n- [Overview of Coda](https://codaprotocol.com/docs/)\n- [Getting Started](https://codaprotocol.com/docs/getting-started/)\n- [My First Transaction](https://codaprotocol.com/docs/my-first-transaction/)\n- [Become a Node Operator](https://codaprotocol.com/docs/node-operator/)\n\n### Technical Papers\n- [Coda Whitepaper](https://cdn.codaprotocol.com/v2/static/coda-whitepaper-05-10-2018-0.pdf)\n\n### Blog\n- [Coda Protocol Blog](https://codaprotocol.com/blog.html)\n\n## Contributing\n\nRead the [Contributing Guide](https://codaprotocol.com/docs/contributing/) for information on how to make both technical and non-technical contributions.\n\n## Developers\n\nThe [Developer docs](https://codaprotocol.com/docs/developers/) contain all the information needed to begin contributing code to Coda, and using Coda APIs to build applications.\n\n\n#### Quick Links:\n* [Developer readme](README-dev.md)\n* [Compiling from source and and running a node](docs/demo.md)\n* [Directory structure](frontend/website/docs/developers/directory-structure.md)\n* [Lifecycle of a payment](frontend/website/docs/architecture/lifecycle-payment.md)\n\n\n## Community\n\n- Join the public [Discord server](https://bit.ly/CodaDiscord)!
