No ICO. Backed by a treasury, emitted from every block during the first five\nyears.\n* Implemented from scratch in C++.\n\n[Read our position paper](https://docs.beam.mw/BEAM_Position_Paper_v0.2.2.pdf)\n\n### Roadmap\n\nSee Beam roadmap for 2019 on https://beam.mw\n\n### Current status\n\n#### Mainnet(January 3rd 2019)\n\n- Fully functional wallet with key generator and storage supporting secure and confidential online transactions.\n- Full node with both transaction and block validation and full UTXO state management.\n- Equihash miner with periodic mining difficulty adjustment.\n- Batch Bulletproofs, the efficient non-interactive zero knowledge range proofs now in batch mode\n- Graphical Wallet Application for Linux, Mac and Windows platforms\n- Offline transactions using Secure BBS system\n- ChainWork - sublinear blockchain validation, based on FlyClient idea by Loi Luu, Benedikt B\xc3\xbcnz, Mahdi Zamani\n- Compact history using cut through\n\n#### Agile Atom (February 2019)\n\n- Payment and Exchange APIs\n- Mining Pool APIs\n- Lightning Network position paper\n\n#### Bright Boson 2.0 (March 2019)\n- Payment proof\n- Ultra fast sync\n- Android Mobile wallet\n\nSee [How to build](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/How-to-build)\n\n# Build status\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BeamMW/beam.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BeamMW/beam)\n[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/0j424l1h61gwqddm/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/beam-mw/beam/branch/master)\n\n'
