You can also fork the tutorial's repo to get started building your own Cosmos SDK application.\r\n\r\nFor more, please go to the [Cosmos SDK Docs](./docs/README.md)\r\n\r\n## Cosmos Hub Mainnet\r\n\r\nThe Cosmos Hub application, `gaia`, has moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia). Go there to join the Cosmos Hub mainnet and more.\r\n\r\n## Disambiguation\r\n\r\nThis Cosmos-SDK project is not related to the [React-Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos) project (yet). Many thanks to Evan Coury and Ovidiu (@skidding) for this Github organization name. As per our agreement, this disambiguation notice will stay here.\r\n"
