Classifying the type of movement amongst six categories:\n- WALKING,\n- WALKING_UPSTAIRS,\n- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,\n- SITTING,\n- STANDING,\n- LAYING.\n\nCompared to a classical approach, using a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory cells (LSTMs) require no or almost no feature engineering. Data can be fed directly into the neural network who acts like a black box, modeling the problem correctly. [Other research](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.names) on the activity recognition dataset can use a big amount of feature engineering, which is rather a signal processing approach combined with classical data science techniques. The approach here is rather very simple in terms of how much was the data preprocessed.\n\nLet\'s use Google\'s neat Deep Learning library, TensorFlow, demonstrating the usage of an LSTM, a type of Artificial Neural Network that can process sequential data / time series.\n\n## Video dataset overview\n\nFollow this link to see a video of the 6 activities recorded in the experiment with one of the participants:\n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=XOEN9W05_4A\n" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/XOEN9W05_4A/0.jpg"\nalt="Video of the experiment" width="400" height="300" border="10" /></a>\n  <a href="https://youtu.be/XOEN9W05_4A"><center>[Watch video]</center></a>\n</p>\n\n## Details about the input data\n\nI will be using an LSTM on the data to learn (as a cellphone attached on the waist) to recognise the type of activity that the user is doing. The dataset\'s description goes like this:\n\n> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.\n\nThat said, I will use the almost raw data: only the gravity effect has been filtered out of the accelerometer  as a preprocessing step for another 3D feature as an input to help learning. If you\'d ever want to extract the gravity by yourself, you could fork my code on using a [Butterworth Low-Pass Filter (LPF) in Python](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/filtering-stft-and-laplace-transform) and edit it to have the right cutoff frequency of 0.3 Hz which is a good frequency for activity recognition from body sensors.\n\n## What is an RNN?\n\nAs explained in [this article](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), an RNN takes many input vectors to process them and output other vectors. It can be roughly pictured like in the image below, imagining each rectangle has a vectorial depth and other special hidden quirks in the image below. **In our case, the "many to one" architecture is used**: we accept time series of [feature vectors](https://www.quora.com/What-do-samples-features-time-steps-mean-in-LSTM/answer/Guillaume-Chevalier-2) (one vector per [time step](https://www.quora.com/What-do-samples-features-time-steps-mean-in-LSTM/answer/Guillaume-Chevalier-2)) to convert them to a probability vector at the output for classification. Note that a "one to one" architecture would be a standard feedforward neural network.\n\n> <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/" ><img src="http://karpathy.github.io/assets/rnn/diags.jpeg" /></a>\n> http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/\n\n## What is an LSTM?\n\nAn LSTM is an improved RNN. It is more complex, but easier to train, avoiding what is called the vanishing gradient problem. I recommend [this article](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) for you to learn more on LSTMs.\n\n\n## Results\n\nScroll on!

Conclusion\n\nOutstandingly, **the final accuracy is of 91%**! And it can peak to values such as 93.25%, at some moments of luck during the training, depending on how the neural network\'s weights got initialized at the start of the training, randomly.\n\nThis means that the neural networks is almost always able to correctly identify the movement type! Remember, the phone is attached on the waist and each series to classify has just a 128 sample window of two internal sensors (a.k.a. 2.56 seconds at 50 FPS), so it amazes me how those predictions are extremely accurate given this small window of context and raw data. I\'ve validated and re-validated that there is no important bug, and the community used and tried this code a lot. (Note: be sure to report something in the issue tab if you find bugs, otherwise [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow?sort=votes&pageSize=50), and other [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/sites#science) sites are the places for asking questions.)\n\nI specially did not expect such good results for guessing between the labels "SITTING" and "STANDING". Those are seemingly almost the same thing from the point of view of a device placed at waist level according to how the dataset was originally gathered. Thought, it is still possible to see a little cluster on the matrix between those classes, which drifts away just a bit from the identity. This is great.\n\nIt is also possible to see that there was a slight difficulty in doing the difference between "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS" and "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS". Obviously, those activities are quite similar in terms of movements.\n\nI also tried my code without the gyroscope, using only the 3D accelerometer\'s 6 features (and not changing the training hyperparameters), and got an accuracy of 87%. In general, gyroscopes consumes more power than accelerometers, so it is preferable to turn them off.\n\n\n## Improvements\n\nIn [another open-source repository of mine](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/HAR-stacked-residual-bidir-LSTMs), the accuracy is pushed up to nearly 94% using a special deep LSTM architecture which combines the concepts of bidirectional RNNs, residual connections, and stacked cells. This architecture is also tested on another similar activity dataset. It resembles the nice architecture used in "[Google\xe2\x80\x99s Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08144.pdf)", without an attention mechanism, and with just the encoder part - as a "many to one" architecture instead of a "many to many" to be adapted to the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) problem. I also worked more on the problem and came up with the [LARNN](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/Linear-Attention-Recurrent-Neural-Network), however it\'s complicated for just a little gain. Thus the current, original activity recognition project is simply better to use for its outstanding simplicity.\n\nIf you want to learn more about deep learning, I have also built a list of the learning ressources for deep learning which have revealed to be the most useful to me [here](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/Awesome-Deep-Learning-Resources).\n\nI also have made even more improvements as seen just below with the few lines of code for easier usage and for reaching an even better score. Note this this is still an ongoing project, [subscribe here](https://www.neuraxio.com/en/time-series-solution) to learn more.\n\n### Even better and easily usable in the cloud\n\nSo I\'m planning to release an easily-usable cloud solution that can be used as follow to classify or forecast your time series, and this isn\'t limited to Human Activity Recognition data:\n\n[![](https://www.neuraxio.com/images/neuraxio-ts-solution.png)](https://www.neuraxio.com/en/time-series-solution)\n\nVisit [the Neuraxio\'s Time Series Solution](https://www.neuraxio.com/en/time-series-solution) product page for more information.\n\n## References\n\nThe [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository:\n\n> Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L.
