It works as intended even if you disallow these. Some features work only when you grant these permissions as mentioned below.\n\n### Tabs permission\n\nWhen you click on the extension icon, the GitHub notifications page is opened in a new tab. The `tabs` permission lets us switch to an existing notifications tab if you already have one opened instead of opening a new one each time you click it.\n\nThis permission also lets us update the notification count immediately after opening a notification. You can find both of these options under the "Tab handling" section in the extension\'s options page.\n\n### Notifications permission\n\nIf you want to receive desktop notifications for public repositories, you can enable them on extension options page. You will then be asked for the `notifications` permission.\n\n### Repos permission\n\nIf you want to receive (useful) desktop notifications for any private repositories you have, you will have to create a GitHub personal access token that has access to the `repo` scope as well. This is due to GitHub\'s current permission scheme, as the only way we can read anything about your private repos is if we have full control over repositories.\n\nIf you\'re concerned with your security in this manner, please feel free to ignore this scope. Just be aware that if you do not grant this scope, clicking on the notification will take you to the notifications home page, since we can\'t get any information about the repo you got the notification for.\n\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Desktop notifications\n\n![Notification from Notifier for GitHub extension](media/screenshot-notification.png)\n\nYou can opt-in to receive desktop notifications for new notifications on GitHub. The extension checks for new notifications every minute, and displays notifications that arrived after the last check if there are any. Clicking on the notification opens it on GitHub.\n\n### GitHub Enterprise support\n\nBy default, the extension works for the public [GitHub](https://github.com) site. If you want the extension to show notifications from a GitHub Enterprise server, you have to configure the extension to use the API URL for your GitHub Enterprise server (like `https://github.yourco.com/`).\n\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)\n- [Laxman Damera](https://github.com/notlmn)\n\n###### Former\n\n- [Yury Solovyov](https://github.com/YurySolovyov)\n'
