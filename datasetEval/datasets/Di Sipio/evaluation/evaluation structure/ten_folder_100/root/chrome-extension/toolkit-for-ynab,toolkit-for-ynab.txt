b'<p align="center">\n  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/SJhwBpU.png" alt="Toolkit for YNAB">\n</p>\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/toolkit-for-ynab/toolkit-for-ynab.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/toolkit-for-ynab/toolkit-for-ynab)\n\nToolkit for YNAB is a browser extension that enhances your experience with the YNAB Web Application.\n\n### Motivation\n\nYNAB have released an exciting new web version. Lots of power users of the older\nversions are asking for options that are easily implemented in a browser extension.\nRather than ask the YNAB team to implement these features, let\'s just do it\nourselves!\n\n### [List of Features](/docs/feature-list.md)\n\nYou can find a full list of features [here](/docs/feature-list.md) and also on the options\npage of the extension once you have installed it which is where you can configure these\nfeatures to be on or off.\n\n### Installing\n\nThe Toolkit is available for Chrome and Firefox. The extension is built using [Browser (Web) Extension APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions)\nwhich means support for Edge should be imminent as well.\n\nIf you don\'t want to build the extension from the source yourself, you can get it for\neach browser at the following links:\n\n- Chrome on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toolkit-for-ynab/lmhdkkhepllpnondndgpgclfjnlofgjl)\n- Firefox on the [Firefox Add-on Repository](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/toolkit-for-ynab/)\n\nNote: Since the extension is built with Web Extensions and that is not supported by Safari,\nthe extension itself is not supported on Safari. When/if Safari decides to support Web Extensions\nwe will do what we can to provide support for their browser.\n\n### Roadmap\n\nFeatures under consideration and the general status of the project and roadmap is\non [our Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/EzOvXlil/ynab-enhanced-roadmap). Feel\nfree to vote and comment. To suggest a new feature, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/toolkit-for-ynab/toolkit-for-ynab/issues/new)\non GitHub. Once the feature has been added to the Trello board, you will be informed\nallowing you to vote and follow the Trello card for any updates.\n\n### Contributions\n\nContributions are greatly welcomed. If you want to contribute, it\'s best if you can let\nus know so we don\'t double up on effort. You can see what is being worked on and by whom\non the roadmap. If you can\'t find what you want to build on the roadmap, feel free to put\na note up on the github issues board to let the team know you\'re working on something new.\nWhen your code is ready, submit a pull request.\n\nFor documentation on how to build a feature, [see the documentation](https://github.com/toolkit-for-ynab/toolkit-for-ynab/blob/master/docs/building-features.md).\n\n### Building the Code\n\nThis extension uses three main things in its build process:\n\n- ESLint: Checks the style of your code to make sure it matches our style guide as you build.\n- Babel: Transpiles ES2015 back to ES5 for browser support of newer JS syntax.\n- Webpack: Bundles entry points for all Web Extension pages (background, popup, options,\n  content scripts) into single files and manages most of the build process.\n\n1. Clone the repository.\n2. Install Node.js (>= v8.12.0) and Yarn (>= v1.10.0).\n\n   - On **macOS** both prerequisites can be setup using `brew`. Ensure command line developer tools (`xcode-select --install`) are also installed.\n   - On **Windows** `node` and `yarn` can be installed via Chocolatey (`choco`) package manager.\n\n3. Run `yarn install` within the folder you cloned. This will install all the dependencies needed for the project.\n4. Run `yarn build:development` from within the folder you cloned which will build the Toolkit.\n\n- Whilst developing, you may prefer to run `yarn watch` which will monitor the project\n  directory for changes and run `yarn build:development` automatically for you.\n\n5. The built extension will be available in the `dist/extension` folder. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`\n   and select the `dist/extension` folder as the folder that you would like to load.\n   - turn on `Developer mode`\n   - click on `Load unpacked`\n6. You may need to reload the Chrome plugin if it\'s been already installed. Visit `chrome://extensions` and click the reload icon ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4d41ad79a8241b062ea59fa332b39028c1469703/68747470733a2f2f636c2e6c792f31633167304633443142316f2f496d616765253230323031382d30362d3034253230617425323031362e32302e33342e706e67)\n\n# Development Methodology\n\n#### ES2015? What\'s that?\n\nWe\'ve decided that it\'s better to use the latest and greatest than to wait for browsers to\nsupport all the nice newer syntax landing in Javascript. If you have any concerns or questions\ndon\'t hesitate to reach out to us in an issue and ask for an invite to our Slack so you can\ncollaborate with the team.\n\n#### Your ESLint style checker is annoying as heck! I don\'t code that way!\n\nWe have a large number of contributors who each bring their own style to the code base.\nIt was getting a bit hard to navigate all the features, as they each had their own way\nof indenting, etc etc. We held a team vote to unify our styles, and decided to follow\nthe AirBNB style guide. It\'s a pretty good way to go, so give it a shot before you\nget too upset about having to change your style.\n\n#### How do I build a feature?\n\nIf you take a look at the `src` folder of the codebase, you\'ll find what seems like a\nlot going on but for the most part, the only directory you should be concerned with as\na feature developer will be `src/extension/features`. Here, you will find more sub\ndirectories which represent each section of the YNAB application. You should select\nthe folder which represents the section of the application you\'d expect your feature to\nrun and start building there.\n\nFor more documentation see the following:\n\n##### New Framework [Documentation](/docs/building-features.md)\n\nThe new framework was built because the old one required you to include a lot of\nboilerplate code in every feature. The new one makes heavier use of ES6 features\nand allows us to remove the burden of boilerplate from new contributions.\n\nThe source code for this lives in the `src/extension/features` directory.\n\n**Important note about line feeds!!!**\nYou must ensure that your code editor is configured to use Unix style line feeds (LFs)\nor the build will fail. This will primarily affect contributors using Windows as\nthe LFs are different on that platform.\n\n## Legal Stuff\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This extension is not affiliated with YNAB in any way and YNAB\nhas not endorsed this at all.
