See [#34](https://github.com/Justineo/github-hovercard/issues/34). GitHub Hovercard won\'t track or record any of these private data.\n\n* Why can GitHub Hovercard\'s demo page find out I have installed the extension or not?\n\n    In Chrome/Opera it\'s allowed to get this information through the API while in Firefox the extension will add a special attribute (`data-github-hovercard`) to the page\'s `body` element so that the demo page can find out if the user has installed GitHub Hovercard. It\'s all about user experience and the extension itself won\'t track or record these data.\n\n* Why access token doesn\'t work?\n\n    Now GitHub Hovercard is saving user\'s private access token into `localStorage`. `localStorage` has a limit of 5MB and the problem might be other extensions have consumed too much storage that GitHub Hovercard failed to save access tokens.\n\n## Options\n\nFor browser extension versions, GitHub Hovercard provide following options:\n\n* Domain\n\n    Use this option to set custom domains for your GitHub Enterprise service. Note that you don\'t need to set `github.com` because it\'s always included. You may be asked to grant additional permissions for those domains.\n\n* Theme\n\n    The theme of hovercards. Defaults to GitHub-style hovercards. You can set it back to the classic dark style in the options.\n\n* Delay\n\n    If you don\'t want the hovercards to pop up instantly, you may set a delay before they try to retrieve data and appear.\n\n* Disable Projects\n\n    You can disable hovercards on project pages for less interference.\n\n* Placement\n\n    You can set the default placement of the hovercards.\n\n* Readme\n\n    You may disable readme content for repo cards if you don\'t need it.\n\n* Show self\n\n    You may choose if you want to show user hovercard for yourself.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<img src="screenshots/1-light.jpg" alt="Users in trending repo avatars" width="640" height="400">\n\n<img src="screenshots/2-light.jpg" alt="Users in feeds" width="640" height="400">\n\n<img src="screenshots/3-light.jpg" alt="Repos in feeds" width="640" height="400">\n\n<img src="screenshots/4-light.jpg" alt="Issues" width="640" height="400">\n\n<img src="screenshots/5-light.jpg" alt="Pull requests" width="640" height="400">\n\n<img src="screenshots/6-light.jpg" alt="Commits" width="640" height="400">\n\n## Known issues\n\nFor unauthenticated requests, GitHub API has a fairly low request limit.\n\n~~In later versions I might introduce access tokens to increase this limit.~~\n\n~~Working on it.~~\n\nAuthentication is supported from v0.0.7.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* Thank [Tooltipster](https://github.com/iamceege/tooltipster/) for the awesome tooltip component.\n* Thank [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) for basic operations.\n* Thank [Mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) for templating.\n'
