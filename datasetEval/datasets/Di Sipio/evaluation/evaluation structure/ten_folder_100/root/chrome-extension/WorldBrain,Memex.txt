We still have some non-critical bugs, but all in all Memex runs smoothly. (Found another bug? [Please do tell](#report-bugs))\n\n\n### Changelog and Roadmap:\nLet us know what you want to see in Memex. We plan to release these new features in 2019:\n**Full Changelog Roadmap:** worldbrain.io/roadmap\n\n\xe2\x9c\x85 Leave annotations on web-based PDF document\n\n\xe2\x9c\x85 Save, tag, annotate and search Tweets in Memex\n\n\xe2\x9c\x85 Sync your Memex across multiple devices\n\n\xe2\x9c\x85 Mobile apps for iOS and Android\n\n\xe2\x9c\x85 Pocket/Readability-like archive and full-page snapshots\n\n\xe2\x9c\x85 Share and publish Memex collections of pages, posts and annotations so others can discover your personal knowledge base \n\n\n\n## Values\n\n### Your data is none of our business\nWith most free software tools you and your data are the product. Not with us. Our practical approach to decentralisation and our economic model allow us to offer most of Memex services without causing costs on our side. \n\n### Interoperability, freedom of choice and less monopolisation\nIn 10 years time we envision 100s of Memex-y tools that are all adapted to the individual workflows different professions and people have. To get there, it is necessary to remove the incentives for Memex providers to lock-in their users and monopolise. \nThe question for us was: How can we create an ecosystem, in which it is more profitable to collaborate than to compete, and where monopolisation is by an order of magnitudes harder. To get there we combine data interoperability with our financial model called [Steward Ownership](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/steward-ownership-is-capitalism-2-0/2018/05/11). While interoperability will make it harder for providers to monopolise, because users have less lock-ins, Steward Ownership provides a company with the intrinsic motivations to stay profitable and be OK not to grow as much. Instead they are able to focus on providing profit generating service to less users, and reduce costs by collaborating with other Memex providers on core infrastructure. More details on this you find [on our manifesto](https://worldbrain.io/preorder#why).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThanks a lot for your interest to contribute to Memex in one way or another.\n\n### Report Bugs \n\nJust open an issue here on [GitHub](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex/issues/new).\n\n### Feature Requests\nHead over to [our community board](https://worldbrain.helprace.com/s1-general/ideas), so that other people can vote on them too.\n\n### Open Tasks\nWanna help in the development to make Memex better?

We will never retain or sell your personal data. \nIt is actually not possible for us to get your personal data because Memex runs locally. When you create Memex.Links we store the highlighted text and the url, so we can deliver it to recipients. However we do not store any IP of people creating, nor requesting them. \n\nApart from that, the only data we obtain are some anonymous analytics on how people use the features of Memex, this data will never be attributable to you or contain any personal data like URLs you visit, terms you search or annotations you made. Also you can completely opt out from that and become a ghost for us. We then have no indication that you even exist.\n\nFor a complete list of things we track, visit our [privacy policy](https://worldbrain.io/privacy-policy/).\n\n## Thanks to\n[Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) for offering free error tracking to open-source projects and generally having an awesome product\n'
