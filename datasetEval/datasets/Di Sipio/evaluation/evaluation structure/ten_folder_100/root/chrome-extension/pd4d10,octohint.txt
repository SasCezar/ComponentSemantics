Or [try this one](https://github.com/pd4d10/octohint/issues/24#issuecomment-450467200). \nYou can use the "On your own" signing option on [Mozilla addon site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/submit/distribution) to create a signed add-on for your self, and install it.\nAlternatively, you can follow [this guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) to install it temporarly from local directory, note that add-on installed this way is temporary add-on, and will be removed every time you restart the Firefox.\n\nMake sure your version of Firefox supports web extensions.\n\n### Opera\n\nUse this extension: [Install Chrome Extensions](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/) to install Octohint from Chrome Web Store\n\n## Features\n\nWith Octohint installed, when you view code at GitHub (For example [this demo](https://github.com/pd4d10/octohint/blob/master/assets/demo.ts)), you\'ll get features as follows:\n\n- Mouse Hover: Show information of current token\n- Left Click: Show all references of current token\n- [\xe2\x8c\x98] + Click: Go to definition of current token (For Windows and Linux user, use [Ctrl] instead)\n\n## Supported languages\n\nOctohint supports all languages. There are two strategies:\n\n- IntelliSense hint: TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, LESS, SCSS\n- Simple token matching: All other languages\n\nIt is because browser only runs JavaScript. But with help of WebAssembly, maybe we could bring other languages\' IntelliSense analysis to browser! It\'s still in research\n\n## Supported platforms\n\nSupport GitHub and GitLab. Since GitLab CE has many versions, I\'m not sure it works correctly on every version. If you find some bugs you could [submit an issue](https://github.com/pd4d10/octohint/issues/new).\n\nBitbucket\'s code viewer UI has changed greatly, so there is still lots of work to do.\n\n## Get your private site works\n\nIf GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket you are using is hosted on different site, go to chrome://extensions, click options of Octohint, then add [match patterns](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns) of your site, like `https://www.example.com/*`.\n\n<img src="assets/options.png" alt="options" width="422">\n\n## Privacy policy\n\nOctohint is a pure client thing. All code analysis are performed at your browser, which means your code and actions log like click, mousemove will never be sent to any server.\n\nFeel free to use it at your private GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.\n\n## Related tools\n\n- [Octoview](https://github.com/pd4d10/octoview): The missing preview feature for GitHub\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n'
