Medium was actually readable once; this extension aims to help people pay attention to writers\' words again instead of Medium\'s UX.\n\n### Improves readability by\n\n* Keeping the top navigation bar from sticking around\n* Hiding the bottom "Get Updates" bar completely\n* Shrinking massive header images\n* Hiding "posts meter" bar and Upgrade header button\n* Hiding "Open in App" button on mobile\n* Blocking the "pardon the interruption" popup\n* (Optionally) hiding the clap / share bar\n* (Optionally) loading all post images up front, instead of lazy loading as you scroll\n* (Optionally) disabling the popup menu that appears when selecting text\n\n### Preview\n\n_Unreadable Medium_\n<kbd>![Medium: unreadable](before.png)</kbd>\n\n_Medium Made Readable Again_\n<kbd>![Medium Made Readable Again](after.png)</kbd>\n\n### Contributing\n\nWant to improve something?

Inspired by this and a time when Medium was more readable, I built a writing platform called [Write.as](https://write.as) that [works great if you never sign up](https://write.as/new), [lets you read](https://read.write.as), and leaves out the comments, claps, and [dickbars](https://daringfireball.net/2017/06/medium_dickbars). It\'s perfect for when you just need to get your thoughts out \xe2\x80\x94 and if you want to share, you can always cross-post to Medium.\n\n### Disclaimer regarding extension permissions\nThis extension requires access to all websites in order to make Medium articles on publications with different domain names than https://medium.com also readable.\n\n### Related\n\nOther extensions to make the internet less annoying:\n\n* [Make Facebook Browsable](https://github.com/thebaer/MFbB)\n'
