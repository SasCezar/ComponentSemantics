This is recommended way of installing the extension, since it will auto-update on every new version.\n\n## Install unpacked version\n\nIf you have a problem installing extension from Chrome Store or just want to run latest and hack on it, just clone the repo (say under `~/workspace/rails_panel`) and in "Developer mode" Chrome Extensions page select "Load Unpacked extension..." and select `~/workspace/rails_panel/rails_panel`.\n\n## Supported environments\n\n* Rails 4, 5 and 6\n* Ruby 2.x\n\n## Editor integration\n\nSelect your preferred editor on the extension options page. Following editors are supported:\n\n* MacVim\n* TextMate\n* Sublime\n* Emacs\n* Atom\n* RubyMine\n\n## Compatibility Warnings\n\nIf you\'re using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) or\n[Rack::LiveReload](https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload) make sure to\nexclude watching your tmp/ folder because meta_request writes a lot of data there\nand your browser will refresh like a madman.\n\n## Clearing the Console\n\nYou can clear the panel with the usual shortcuts of \xe2\x8c\x98+K or ctrl+L.\n\n## Code status\n\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dejan/rails_panel.svg?style=svg&circle-token=56cf52dd2729102bb9b6e23d5e2fcc8eff0875b3)](https://circleci.com/gh/dejan/rails_panel)\n\n## Licence\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Dejan Simic\n\nMIT License\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n"Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
