This is the unified code repository for the Ghostery browser extensions in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge.\n\n## Downloads\n**Firefox / Cliqz** &ndash; [Download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/)\n\n**Chrome** &ndash; [Download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghostery-%E2%80%93-privacy-ad-blo/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij)\n\n**Opera** &ndash; [Download](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/ghostery/)\n\n**Edge** &ndash; [Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/ghostery/9nblggh52ngz)\n\n## Installation\n\n#### Install yarn\n**https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install**\n\n#### Install local npm packages\n```sh\n$ yarn install --frozen-lockfile\n```\n\n#### Upgrade packages\n```sh\n# Upgrade packages according to package.json version range\n# https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/upgrade/\n$ yarn upgrade\n```\n\n## Building\n```sh\n# Build all sources\n$ yarn build.dev\n```\n\n```sh\n# Build for production\n$ yarn build.prod\n```\n\n```sh\n# Build and watch for changes\n$ yarn build.watch\n```\n\n## Enable Debugging / Logging\n```javascript\n// In manifest.json set\n"debug": true,\n"log": true,\n```\n\n## Testing and Linting\n```sh\n# Update Jest snapshot artifacts\n$ yarn test.snapshot\n```\n\n```sh\n# Run unit tests\n$ yarn test.unit\n```\n\n```sh\n# Run linter over the ./app and ./src folders\n$ yarn lint\n```\n\n```sh\n# Lint a specific file\n$ yarn lint.raw src/utils/matcher.js\n```\n\n```sh\n# Test i18n string lengths for panel UI\n$ yarn leet\n# Reset back to original en language file\n$ yarn leet.reset\n```\n\n## Build Docs\n```sh\n# Build JSDoc files to ./docs\n$ yarn docs\n```\n\n## Internationalization\nWe use Transifex and their CLI to manage our translation files. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.transifex.com/client/installing-the-client) to get started.\n\nNote: There is no need to run `tx config` as the project has already been configured to work with Transifex. See the configuration file in `.tx/config`.\n\nNext, [generate an API Token](https://www.transifex.com/user/settings/api/), run `tx init`, and paste the generated API Token when prompted.  This will allow the computer to push (Submit) and pull (Download) files to/from Transifex.\n\n```sh\n# Submit translation files to Transifex\n$ tx push -s\n```\n\n```sh\n# Download translated files from Transifex\n$ tx pull -a\n```\n\n```sh\n# Add the placeholders into the downloaded translation files.\n$ node tools/transifex.js\n```\n\n## Cliqz Source Code\nGhostery implements the following open-source products from [Cliqz](https://cliqz.com/en/)\n\n[**Human Web**](https://cliqz.com/en/whycliqz/human-web)\n+ [How it works](https://cliqz.com/en/magazine/techblog-human-web-reliably-removes-uids)\n+ [GitHub](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/browser-core/blob/master/modules/human-web/)\n\n[**Anti-Tracking**](https://cliqz.com/en/whycliqz/anti-tracking)\n+ [How it works](https://cliqz.com/en/magazine/how-we-at-cliqz-protect-users-from-web-tracking)\n+ [GitHub](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/browser-core/blob/master/modules/antitracking)\n\n[**Ad Blocker**](https://cliqz.com/en/whycliqz/adblocking)\n+ [GitHub](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/adblocker)\n\n[**MyOffrz**](https://cliqz.com/en/cliqz-angebote)\n+ [GitHub](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/browser-core/blob/master/modules/offers-v2)\n\n### Building Cliqz Modules for Ghostery\nCliqz modules are pre-built and included under the `browser-core` NPM dependency in [package.json](package.json).
