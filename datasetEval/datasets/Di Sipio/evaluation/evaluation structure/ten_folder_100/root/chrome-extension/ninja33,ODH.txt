b"# Online Dictionary Helper (with Anki support)\n\n[[\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87\xe7\x89\x88\xe8\xaf\xb4\xe6\x98\x8e](README.zh_CN.md)]\n\nOnline Dictionary Helper is a Chrome/Firefox extension to show definitions for words and phrases from online (or builtin) dictionary via users' selection on any webpage and PDF documents (using [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/)), which also supports flash-card creation using [Anki](https://github.com/dae/anki) (with **[AnkiConnect](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect)**, an Anki add-on, installed).\n\nDetails on the reasons for making this extension can be found in the [background](doc/background.md) introduction if you are interested.\n\n![Anki Notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ninja33/ODH/master/doc/img/anki_001_640x400.png)\n\nWhat might set this extension apart is that users can grab online dictionary content with their own customized script (running under extension development mode). For development details, please check the [development guide](doc/development.md).\n\n## How to use\n\n- [Install from Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/anki-online-dictionary-he/lppjdajkacanlmpbbcdkccjkdbpllajb?hl=en)\n\n- [Install from Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/online-dictionary-helper/)\n\n1.
