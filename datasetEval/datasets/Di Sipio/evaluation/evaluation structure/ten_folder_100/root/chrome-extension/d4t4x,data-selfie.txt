b'# Data Selfie\n\nWork in progress. Some information might not apply.\n\n* * *\n\n## How to use\n\n#### monitor your monitoring\n- open console in any Facebook tab (by pressing Alt+Cmd+J on a Mac)\n- you can see logs of what is happening in the background with Data Selfie\n\n#### fix for most errors\n- "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" - refresh the Facebook tab or close and open a new one\n\n#### short cuts\n- url bar, type "ds" + tab\n- available commands ```reset db```, ```delete db```, ```init db```\n\n#### access local data\n\n###### tracked data\n- open console in background page or Data Selfie Me page (Alt+Cmd+J on a Mac)\n- go to the "Application" tab\n- Storage > IndexedDB\n- click triangle to expand the subitems\n- "DataSelfieLocalDB" contains all tracked data (this is not saved anywhere else(!), so be careful before clearing this storage)\n\n###### chrome local storage\n- you can access settings, your general user data and the prediction\n    - open console in background page or Data Selfie Me page (Alt+Cmd+J on a Mac)\n    - copy ```chrome.storage.local.get(function(data){console.log(data)})```\n    - press Enter\n\n- you can delete your prediction results to start new\n    - open console in background page or Data Selfie Me page (Alt+Cmd+J on a Mac)\n    - copy ```chrome.storage.local.remove(["alchemy", "applymagicsauce", "personality"])```\n    - press Enter\n\n* * *\n\n## How to run (locally) and pack\n\n- ```npm install```\n- to make a build (folder) from src ```npm run build```\n- to make a build and watch for changes ```npm run buildw```\n- to make a build and minify etc (see webpack.config.js) ```npm run buildprod```\n    - use this to reproduce the code submitted to Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons\n    - for both Chrome and Firefox the content of the build folder is compressed and submitted to the developer platform\n\n#### Chrome extension\n\n- in your Chrome browser go to chrome://extensions/ and tick the box that says "Developer mode"\n- now click "Load unpacked extension..." and choose the build folder you just created\n- you can now use Data Selfie, the extension icon (the eye) should now appear in your toolbar\n- it is tracking if the eye is black (instead of gray) and if you can see a clock at the bottom left in your facebook window\n\n#### Firefox add-on\n\n- go to about:debugging and and click on "Load Temporary Add-on"\n- choose manifest.json from the build folder and hit enter\n\n#### Difference Chrome and Firefox\n\n- background.persistent: Event pages are not currently supported in Firefox. Background page has to be persistent\n\n* * *\n\n#### Known bugs\n- posts like friendship anniversaries and memories are not considered, which sometimes leads to time being added to the previously looked at post\n- when Facebook tab has been in the background for a while and you go back the clock might not show up again\n- exporting your data can result in an invalid json file (that you can\'t import), when URLs contain double quotes " that are not escaped, you can do that manually by adding \\ before the "\n- more bugs commented in source code marked with "// FIX"\n\n#### To Do List\n- refine the limit of data sent to IBM (Alchemy and Personality Insights), now only last 300 rows - add date (e.g. last 5 days from last time active)\n- make tracking more stable (we need your help, please report any problems you run into)\n- improve Your Data Selfie (Me) page front end code (responsive, handlebars or similar instead of jquery append - I know horrible)\n\n* * *\n\n#### Disclaimer\n\nThis project is maintained by one developer (Hang aka 01fade) as of now.
