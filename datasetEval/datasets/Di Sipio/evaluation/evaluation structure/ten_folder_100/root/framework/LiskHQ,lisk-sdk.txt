With this repository we have opened access to the alpha release of the Lisk SDK. We have released the Lisk SDK in its current form in order for us to improve the development experience through community feedback and contributions.\n\nWe strictly discourage anyone from using the alpha release of the Lisk SDK for any production-based blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain operating on a real mainnet. Over the course of the alpha phase there will be significant changes in the Lisk protocol and implementation, which will eventually bring the accessibility and reliability to a level which is feasible for production-based blockchain applications. At this time we only recommend the Lisk SDK for proof-of-concept blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain operating on a fake testnet.\n\nThe only application built using the Lisk SDK currently feasible for production usage is [Lisk Core](https://github.com/liskhq/lisk-core), the client of the Lisk network itself.\n\nPlease be advised we cannot guarantee blockchains created with the alpha release of the Lisk SDK will remain compatible with our planned (beta/rc) releases.\n\nWe hope you enjoy building your proof-of-concept blockchain applications using the Lisk SDK, and shall look forward to receiving your feedback and contributions during the alpha phase.\n\n## What is the Lisk SDK?\n\nThe Lisk SDK aims to provide an easy and reliable software development kit for building blockchain applications which are compatible with the [Lisk Protocol](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-protocol). The architecture of the Lisk SDK has been designed so that it can be extended to meet the requirements of a wide variety of blockchain application use-cases. The codebase is written entirely in JavaScript, which means for a majority of developers, no significant change of tools or mindset is required to get started. The Lisk SDK makes every effort to allow developers to focus simply and purely on writing the code that matters to their own blockchain application, and nothing more.\n\n## Usage\n\n#### Dependencies\n\nBefore running Lisk SDK, the following dependencies need to be installed in order to run applications created with the Lisk SDK:\n\n| Dependencies     | Version |\n| ---------------- | ------- |\n| NodeJS           | 10.4+   |\n| PostgreSQL       | 10+     |\n| Redis (optional) | 5+      |\n\nYou can find further details on installing these dependencies in our [pre-installation setup guide](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/setup/source#pre-install).\n\nMind, that you need to create a database before. The default database name is `lisk_dev`, so for the development purposes, a command `createdb lisk_dev` will set you up.\n\n### Installation\n\nThe installation of Lisk Alpha SDK is straightforward and limited to getting a single NPM package, `lisk-sdk`, to your Node.js project:\n\n```\nnpm install lisk-sdk@alpha\n```\n\nLisk SDK is all-in-one package that provides you with tools to create, run and maintain blockchain applications in JavaScript.\n\n### Set up new a blockchain application\n\nTo start, create the project structure of your blockchain application. There are no special requirements here, you can create the basic Node.js project folder structure with `npm init`.\n\nTo create a blockchain application, you need to provide an entry point of your application (like `index.js`) and set-up your network by using the modules of Lisk SDK.\n\nIt is quite simple to have a working blockchain application, mirroring the configuration of the existing Lisk network. This can be done by copying the following three lines of code to your `index.js`:\n\n```js\nconst { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require(\'lisk-sdk\');\n\nconst app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet);\n\napp\n\t.run()\n\t.then(() => app.logger.info(\'App started...\'))\n\t.catch(error => {\n\t\tconsole.error(\'Faced error in application\', error);\n\t\tprocess.exit(1);\n\t});\n```\n\nAfter that you can start the application by:\n\n```\nnode index.js\n```\n\n### Configure your blockchain parameters\n\nYou can also define your blockchain application parameters such as `BLOCK_TIME`, `EPOCH_TIME`, `MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_BLOCK` and more with an optional configurations object.\n\n```js\nconst app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, {\n    app: {\n        label: \'my-blockchain-application\',\n        genesisConfig: {\n            EPOCH_TIME: new Date(Date.UTC(2016, 4, 24, 17, 0, 0, 0)).toISOString(),\n            BLOCK_TIME: 10,\n            MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_BLOCK: 25,\n        },\n        ...\n});\n```\n\nFor a complete list of configuration options see the [lisk-docs repo](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-docs/blob/development/lisk-sdk/configuration.md).\n\n### Register a custom transaction\n\nYou can [define your own transaction types](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-docs/blob/master/lisk-sdk/customize.md) with Lisk-SDK. This is where the custom logic for your blockchain application lives.\n\nAdd your custom transaction type to your blockchain application by registering it to the application instance:\n\n```js\nconst { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require(\'lisk-sdk\');\n\nconst MyTransaction = require(\'./my_transaction\');\n\nconst app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet);\n\napp.registerTransaction(MyTransaction); // register the custom transaction\n\napp\n\t.run()\n\t.then(() => app.logger.info(\'App started...\'))\n\t.catch(error => {\n\t\tconsole.error(\'Faced error in application\', error);\n\t\tprocess.exit(1);\n\t});\n```\n\nFor information on creating your own custom transaction, see the [lisk-docs repo](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-docs/blob/master/lisk-sdk/customize.md) or [follow the tutorials](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-docs/blob/development/start/tutorials/hello-world.md).\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nThe Lisk SDK operates on the NodeJS runtime and consists primarily of an application framework (Lisk Framework), a collection of libraries providing blockchain application functionalities (Lisk Elements), and a powerful command-line tool (Lisk Commander) allowing developers to manage a Lisk node instance and interact with a Lisk compatible network. The diagram below provides a high-level overview of the architecture:\n\n![Diagram](./docs/assets/diagram_sdk.png)\n\n### Packages\n\n| Directory                | Description                                                                                                                                          |\n| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Framework](./framework) | An application framework responsible for establishing and maintaining the interactions between the modules of a Lisk blockchain application.         |\n| [Elements](./elements)   | A collection of libraries, each of them implementing some form of blockchain application functionality such as cryptography, transactions, p2p, etc. |\n| [Commander](./commander) | A command line tool allowing developers to manage a Lisk node instance and interact with a Lisk compatible network.                                  |\n\n## Get Involved\n\n| Reason                          | How                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Want to chat with our community | [Reach them on Discord](https://discord.gg/lisk)                                               |\n| Found a bug                     | [Open a new issue](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk/issues/new)                                  |\n| Found a security issue          | [See our bounty program](https://blog.lisk.io/announcing-lisk-bug-bounty-program-5895bdd46ed4) |\n| Want to share your research     | [Propose your research](https://research.lisk.io)                                              |\n| Want to develop with us         | [Create a fork](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk/fork)                                           |\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nTo contribute to `lisk-sdk`, `framework` or `elements`:\n\n1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk.git`\n\n2. Install dependencies and build:\n   1. `npm ci`\n   2. `npm run bootstrap`\n   3. `npm run build`\n\n### Testing local changes to `lisk-sdk/framework`\n\nBefore testing local changes to `lisk-sdk/framework`, follow the above steps for installation/building of dependencies and then run:\n\n1. `npx lerna link`\n\n### Testing local changes to `lisk-sdk/elements`\n\nBefore testing local changes to `lisk-sdk/elements`, follow the above steps for installation/building of dependencies and then run:\n\n1. `npx lerna link`\n\n2. Once you have linked your local repo, everytime you make changes in `lisk-sdk/elements` you must build packages before testing:\n\n   a. To build all packages: `npm run build`\n\n   b. To build specific package: `lerna run build --scope <package name>`\n   Example: `lerna run build --scope @liskhq/lisk-p2p`\n\n   c. To build packages that have been modified in your branch: `lerna run build --since <branch name>`\n   Example:`lerna run build --since development`\n\n**Note:** In case you face any issues during the installation make sure you have the right version of `npm` and `node` and try to install from scratch by running,\n`npm run clean:node_modules && rm -rf ./node_modules`.\n\n### Testing your local `lisk-sdk` in your application.\n\nIn order to link your local lisk-sdk repository and test your application which uses `lisk-sdk`, simply follow the steps above in your local `lisk-sdk` repository and run `npm link lisk-sdk` in the root of your application.\n\n## Contributors\n\nhttps://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk/graphs/contributors\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nBy using the Alpha release of the Lisk SDK, you acknowledge and agree that you have an adequate understanding of the risks associated with the use of the Alpha release of the Lisk SDK and that it is provided on an \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cas available\xe2\x80\x9d basis, without any representations or warranties of any kind.
