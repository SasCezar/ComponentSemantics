b'# Sparkle [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sparkle-project/Sparkle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sparkle-project/Sparkle) [![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) [![CocoaPods](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/Sparkle.svg?maxAge=2592000)]() <a href="https://www.stackpath.com/?utm_source=sparkle-github&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=readme"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sponsored%20by-StackPath-orange.svg" alt="sponsored by: StackPath"></a>\n\nSecure and reliable software update framework for Cocoa developers.\n\n<img src="Resources/Screenshot.png" width="732" alt="Sparkle shows familiar update window with release notes">\n\n## Features\n\n* Seamless. There\'s no mention of Sparkle; your icons and app name are used.\n* Secure. Updates are verified using EdDSA signatures and Apple Code Signing.\n* Fast. Supports delta updates which only patch files that have changed.\n* Easy to install. Sparkle requires no code in your app, and only needs static files on a web server.\n* Supports bundles, preference panes, plugins, and other non-.app software. Can install .pkg files for more complicated products.\n* Handles permissions, quarantine and automatically asks for authentication if needed.\n* Uses RSS-based appcasts for release information. Appcasts are a de-facto standard supported by 3rd party update-tracking programs and websites.\n* Stays hidden until second launch for better first impressions.\n* Truly self-updating\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8athe user can choose to automatically download and install all updates in the background.\n* Ability to mark updates as critical.\n* Progress and status notifications for the host app.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Runtime: macOS 10.7 or greater\n* Build: Xcode 9 and 10.11 SDK or greater\n* HTTPS server for serving updates (see [App Transport Security](http://sparkle-project.org/documentation/app-transport-security/))\n* No sandboxing. Sparkle 1.x can\'t update sandboxed apps. Sparkle 2.0 (alpha) can.\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [getting started guide](https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/). No code is necessary, but a bit of Xcode configuration is required.\n\n## Development\n\nThis repository uses git submodules, and will not build unless you clone recursively. Also, GitHub-provided ZIP/tar archives are broken due to GitHub not supporting git submodules properly.\n\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n  * Please check **Console.app**. Sparkle prints detailed information there about all problems it encounters. It often also suggests solutions to the problems, so please read Sparkle\'s log messages carefully.\n\n  * Use the `generate_appcast` tool which creates appcast files, correct signatures, and delta updates automatically.\n\n  * Make sure the URL specified in [`SUFeedURL`](https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/customization/) is valid (typos/404s are a common error!), and that it uses modern TLS ([test it](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)).\n\n  * Delete your app\'s preferences (in `~/Library/Preferences/<your bundle id>`) if you\'ve set another feed URL programmatically via Sparkle\'s Objective-C interface.\n\n### API symbols\n\nSparkle is built with `-fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden` which means no symbols are exported by default.\nIf you are adding a symbol to the public API you must decorate the declaration with the `SU_EXPORT` macro (grep the source code for examples).\n\n### Building the distribution package\n\n`cd` to the root of the Sparkle source tree and run `make release`. Sparkle-*VERSION*.tar.bz2 will be created in a temporary directory and revealed in Finder after the build has completed.\n\nAlternatively, build the Distribution scheme in the Xcode UI.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nWe pledge to have an open and welcoming environment. See our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Project Sponsor\n\n[StackPath](https://www.stackpath.com/?utm_source=sparkle-github&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme-footer)\n'
