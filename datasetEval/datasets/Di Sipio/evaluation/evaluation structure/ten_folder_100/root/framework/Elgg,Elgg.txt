The Foundation aims to provide a stable, commercially and\nindividually independent organization that operates in the best interest of Elgg\nas an open source project.\n\nThe Elgg project was started in 2004 by\n - Ben Werdmuller (<ben@benwerd.com>, <http://benwerd.com>)\n - Dave Tosh (<https://twitter.com/davetosh>).\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2019, see COPYRIGHT.txt\n\nElgg is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2 and the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT-X11) License. \n\nSee LICENSE.txt in the root of the package you downloaded.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nFor installation instructions, see http://learn.elgg.org/en/stable/intro/install.html.\n\nFor upgrade instructions, see http://learn.elgg.org/en/stable/admin/upgrading.html.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nThe project site can be found at http://elgg.org/.\n\nVisit http://learn.elgg.org for more information about Elgg.\n\nContributors\n------------\n\nFor development credits, see CONTRIBUTORS.txt.\n"
