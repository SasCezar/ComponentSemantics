b'![alt text](https://d30pueezughrda.cloudfront.net/juce/JUCE_banner.png "JUCE")\n\nJUCE is an open-source cross-platform C++ application framework used for rapidly\ndeveloping high quality desktop and mobile applications, including VST, AU (and AUv3),\nRTAS and AAX audio plug-ins. JUCE can be easily integrated with existing projects or can\nbe used as a project generation tool via the [Projucer](https://juce.com/discover/projucer),\nwhich supports exporting projects for Xcode (macOS and iOS), Visual Studio, Android Studio,\nCode::Blocks, CLion and Linux Makefiles as well as containing a source code editor and\nlive-coding engine which can be used for rapid prototyping.\n\n## Getting Started\nThe JUCE repository contains a [master](https://github.com/weareroli/JUCE/tree/master)\nand [develop](https://github.com/weareroli/JUCE/tree/develop) branch. The develop branch\ncontains the latest bugfixes and features and is periodically merged into the master\nbranch in stable [tagged releases](https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE/releases)\n(the latest release containing pre-built binaries can be also downloaded from the\n[JUCE website](https://shop.juce.com/get-juce)).\n\nThe repository doesn\'t contain a pre-built Projucer so you will need to build it\nfor your platform - Xcode, Visual Studio and Linux Makefile projects are located in\n[extras/Projucer/Builds](/extras/Projucer/Builds)\n(the minumum system requirements are listed in the __System Requirements__ section below).\nThe Projucer can then be used to create new JUCE projects, view tutorials and run examples.\nIt is also possible to include the JUCE modules source code in an existing project directly,\nor build them into a static or dynamic library which can be linked into a project.\n\nFor further help getting started, please refer to the JUCE\n[documentation](https://juce.com/learn/documentation) and\n[tutorials](https://juce.com/learn/tutorials).\n\n## Minimum System Requirements\n#### Building JUCE Projects\n- __macOS__: macOS 10.11 and Xcode 7.3.1\n- __Windows__: Windows 8.1 and Visual Studio 2015 64-bit\n- __Linux__: GCC 4.8\n\n#### Deployment Targets\n- __macOS__: macOS 10.7\n- __Windows__: Windows Vista\n- __Linux__: Mainstream Linux distributions\n\n## Contributing\nFor bug reports and features requests, please visit the [JUCE Forum](https://forum.juce.com/) -\nthe JUCE developers are active there and will read every post and respond accordingly.
