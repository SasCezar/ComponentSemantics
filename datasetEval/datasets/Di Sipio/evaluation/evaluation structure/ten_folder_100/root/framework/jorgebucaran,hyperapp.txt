b'# [Hyperapp](https://hyperapp.dev) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/hyperapp.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/releases/latest)\n\n> The tiny framework for building web interfaces.\n\n- **Do more with less**\xe2\x80\x94We have minimized the concepts you need to learn to be productive. Views, actions, effects, and subscriptions are all pretty easy to get to grips with and work together seamlessly.\n- **Write what, not how**\xe2\x80\x94With a declarative syntax that\'s easy to read and natural to write, Hyperapp is your tool of choice to develop purely functional, feature-rich, browser-based applications.\n- **Hypercharged**\xe2\x80\x94Hyperapp is a modern VDOM engine, state management solution, and application design pattern all-in-one. Once you learn to use it, there\'ll be no end to what you can do.\n\nTo learn more, go to <https://hyperapp.dev> for documentation, guides, and examples.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nInstall Hyperapp with npm or Yarn:\n\n```console\nnpm i hyperapp\n```\n\nThen with a module bundler like [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) import it in your application and get right down to business.\n\n```js\nimport { h, app } from "hyperapp"\n```\n\nDon\'t want to set up a build step? Import Hyperapp in a `<script>` tag as a module. Don\'t worry; modules are supported in all evergreen, self-updating desktop, and mobile browsers.\n\n```html\n<script type="module">\n  import { h, app } from "https://unpkg.com/hyperapp"\n</script>\n```\n\nHere\'s the first example to get you started: a counter that can go up or down. You can try it online [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/hyperapp-playground-fwjlo).\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang="en">\n  <head>\n    <script type="module">\n      import { h, app } from "https://unpkg.com/hyperapp"\n\n      app({\n        init: 0,\n        view: state =>\n          h("main", {}, [\n            h("h1", {}, state),\n            h("button", { onClick: state => state - 1 }, "-"),\n            h("button", { onClick: state => state + 1 }, "+")\n          ]),\n        node: document.getElementById("app")\n      })\n    </script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <main id="app"></main>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe app starts off with `init` as the initial state. Our code doesn\'t explicitly maintain any state. Instead, we define actions to transform it and a view to visualize it. The view returns a plain object representation of the DOM known as a virtual DOM, and Hyperapp updates the real DOM to match it whenever the state changes.\n\nNow it\'s your turn! Experiment with the code a bit. Spend some time thinking about how the view reacts to changes in the state. Can you add a button that resets the counter back to zero? Or how about multiple counters?\n\n## Help, I\'m stuck!\n\nWe love to talk JavaScript and Hyperapp. If you\'ve hit a stumbling block, hop on the [Hyperapp Slack](https://hyperappjs.herokuapp.com) or drop by [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/hyperapp) to get support, and if you don\'t receive an answer, or if you remain stuck, please file an issue, and we\'ll try to help you out.\n\nIs anything wrong, unclear, missing?
