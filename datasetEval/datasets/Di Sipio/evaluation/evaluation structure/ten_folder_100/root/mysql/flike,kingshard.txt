b"#  kingshard [\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87\xe4\xb8\xbb\xe9\xa1\xb5](README_ZH.md)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flike/kingshard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flike/kingshard)\n\n## Overview\n\nkingshard is a high-performance proxy for MySQL powered by Go. Just like other mysql proxies, you can use it to split the read/write sqls. Now it supports basic SQL statements (select, insert, update, replace, delete). The most important feature is the sharding function. Kingshard aims to simplify the sharding solution of MySQL. **The Performance of kingshard is about 80% compared to connecting to MySQL directly.**\n\n## Feature\n\n### 1. Basic Function\n- Splits reads and writes\n- Client's ip ACL control.\n- Transaction in single node.\n- Support limiting the max count of connections to MySQL database.\n- Support setting the backend database online or offline dynamically.\n- Supports prepared statement: COM_STMT_PREPARE, COM_STMT_EXECUTE, etc.\n- Support multi slaves, and load balancing between slaves.\n- Support reading master database forcely.\n- Support last_insert_id().\n- Support MySQL backends HA.\n- Support set the charset of proxy.\n- Support SQL blacklist.\n- Support dynamically changing the config value of kingshard.\n\n### 2. Sharding Function\n- Support hash,range and date sharding across multiple nodes.\n- Support sending sql to the specified node.\n- Support most commonly used functions, such as `max, min, count, sum`, and also support `join, limit, order by,group by`.\n\n## Install\n```\n  1.
