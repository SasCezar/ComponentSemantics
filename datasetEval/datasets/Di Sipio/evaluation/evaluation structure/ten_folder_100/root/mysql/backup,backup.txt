No new features are planned.\n\nBackup is a system utility for Linux and Mac OS X, distributed as a RubyGem, that allows you to easily perform backup\noperations. It provides an elegant DSL in Ruby for _modeling_ your backups. Backup has built-in support for various\ndatabases, storage protocols/services, syncers, compressors, encryptors and notifiers which you can mix and match. It\nwas built with modularity, extensibility and simplicity in mind.\n\n[Installation][] &middot; [Release Notes][] &middot; [Documentation][] &middot; [Issues][] &middot;  [Chat][Gitter]\n\n## Project Status: Maintenance-Only ##\n\nThis project is not under active development, although we will continue to provide support for current users, and at least one more maintenance release: version 5.0.
