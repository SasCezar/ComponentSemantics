b"## Building a Full Stack Polls app similar to twitter polls with Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, React and Ant Design\n\n![App Screenshot](screenshot.png)\n\n### Tutorials\n\nI've written a complete tutorial series for this application on The CalliCoder Blog -\n\n+ [Part 1: Bootstrapping the Project and creating the basic domain models and repositories](https://www.callicoder.com/spring-boot-spring-security-jwt-mysql-react-app-part-1/)\n\n+ [Part 2: Configuring Spring Security along with JWT authentication and Building Rest APIs for Login and SignUp](https://www.callicoder.com/spring-boot-spring-security-jwt-mysql-react-app-part-2/)\n\n+ [Part 3: Building Rest APIs for creating Polls, voting for a choice in a Poll, retrieving user profile etc](https://www.callicoder.com/spring-boot-spring-security-jwt-mysql-react-app-part-3/)\n\n+ [Part 4: Building the front-end using React and Ant Design](https://www.callicoder.com/spring-boot-spring-security-jwt-mysql-react-app-part-4/)\n\n## Steps to Setup the Spring Boot Back end app (polling-app-server)\n\n1. **Clone the application**\n\n\t```bash\n\tgit clone https://github.com/callicoder/spring-security-react-ant-design-polls-app.git\n\tcd polling-app-server\n\t```\n\n2. **Create MySQL database**\n\n\t```bash\n\tcreate database polling_app\n\t```\n\n3. **Change MySQL username and password as per your MySQL installation**\n\n\t+ open `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.\n\n\t+ change `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password` properties as per your mysql installation\n\n4. **Run the app**\n\n\tYou can run the spring boot app by typing the following command -\n\n\t```bash\n\tmvn spring-boot:run\n\t```\n\n\tThe server will start on port 8080.\n\n\tYou can also package the application in the form of a `jar` file and then run it like so -\n\n\t```bash\n\tmvn package\n\tjava -jar target/polls-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\n\t```\n5. **Default Roles**\n\t\n\tThe spring boot app uses role based authorization powered by spring security. To add the default roles in the database, I have added the following sql queries in `src/main/resources/data.sql` file. Spring boot will automatically execute this script on startup -\n\n\t```sql\n\tINSERT IGNORE INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_USER');\n\tINSERT IGNORE INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_ADMIN');\n\t```\n\n\tAny new user who signs up to the app is assigned the `ROLE_USER` by default.\n\n## Steps to Setup the React Front end app (polling-app-client)\n\nFirst go to the `polling-app-client` folder -\n\n```bash\ncd polling-app-client\n```\n\nThen type the following command to install the dependencies and start the application -\n\n```bash\nnpm install && npm start\n```\n\nThe front-end server will start on port `3000`.\n"
