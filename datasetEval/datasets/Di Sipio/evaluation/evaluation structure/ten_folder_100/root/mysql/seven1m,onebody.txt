Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) on your host machine.\n1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads).\n   * If you\'re on Mac, you can use [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/).\n   * If you\'re on Windows, you can use [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/).\n1. Clone the repository to your host machine: `git clone git://github.com/seven1m/onebody.git` (If you forked the project, clone from your own fork.)\n1. In your terminal, change to the project directory: `cd onebody`\n1. Run vagrant: `vagrant up`\n\nNow visit the site running in development mode at http://localhost:3000.\n\nYou can use your favorite text editor to make changes inside the `onebody` directory. Changes should show in your browser after refreshing.\n\nCheck out [Using Vagrant](https://github.com/seven1m/onebody/wiki/Using-Vagrant) on the wiki for further help and tips.\n\n### Manual Development Setup on Mac or Linux\n\n1.
