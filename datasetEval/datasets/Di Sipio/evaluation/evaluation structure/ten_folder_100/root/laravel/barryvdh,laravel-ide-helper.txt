Generation is done based on the files in your project, so they are always up-to-date.\nIf you don\'t want to generate it, you can add a pre-generated file to the root folder of your Laravel project (but this isn\'t as up-to-date as self generated files).\n\n* Generated version for L5: https://gist.github.com/barryvdh/5227822\n* Generated version for Lumen: https://gist.github.com/barryvdh/be17164b0ad51f832f20\n* Generated Phpstorm Meta file: https://gist.github.com/barryvdh/bb6ffc5d11e0a75dba67\n\nNote: You do need CodeComplice for Sublime Text: https://github.com/spectacles/CodeComplice\n\n### Install\n\nRequire this package with composer using the following command:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require --dev barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper\n```\n\nAfter updating composer, add the service provider to the `providers` array in `config/app.php`\n\n```php\nBarryvdh\\LaravelIdeHelper\\IdeHelperServiceProvider::class,\n```\n**Laravel 5.5** uses Package Auto-Discovery, so doesn\'t require you to manually add the ServiceProvider.\n\nIn Laravel, instead of adding the service provider in the `config/app.php` file, you can add the following code to your `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` file, within the `register()` method:\n\n```php\npublic function register()\n{\n    if ($this->app->environment() !== \'production\') {\n        $this->app->register(\\Barryvdh\\LaravelIdeHelper\\IdeHelperServiceProvider::class);\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThis will allow your application to load the Laravel IDE Helper on non-production enviroments.\n\n### Automatic phpDoc generation for Laravel Facades\n\nYou can now re-generate the docs yourself (for future updates)\n\n```bash\nphp artisan ide-helper:generate\n```\n\nNote: `bootstrap/compiled.php` has to be cleared first, so run `php artisan clear-compiled` before generating.\n\nYou can configure your composer.json to do this after each commit:\n\n```js\n"scripts":{\n    "post-update-cmd": [\n        "Illuminate\\\\Foundation\\\\ComposerScripts::postUpdate",\n        "@php artisan ide-helper:generate",\n        "@php artisan ide-helper:meta"\n    ]\n},\n```\n\nYou can also publish the config file to change implementations (ie. interface to specific class) or set defaults for `--helpers` or `--sublime`.\n\n```bash\nphp artisan vendor:publish --provider="Barryvdh\\LaravelIdeHelper\\IdeHelperServiceProvider" --tag=config\n```\n\nThe generator tries to identify the real class, but if it cannot be found, you can define it in the config file.\n\nSome classes need a working database connection. If you do not have a default working connection, some facades will not be included.\nYou can use an in-memory SQLite driver by adding the `-M` option.\n\nYou can choose to include helper files. This is not enabled by default, but you can override it with the `--helpers (-H)` option.\nThe `Illuminate/Support/helpers.php` is already set up, but you can add/remove your own files in the config file.\n\n### Automatic phpDocs for models\n\nIf you don\'t want to write your properties yourself, you can use the command `php artisan ide-helper:models` to generate\nphpDocs, based on table columns, relations and getters/setters. You can write the comments directly to your Model file, using the `--write (-W)` option. By default, you are asked to overwrite or write to a separate file (`_ide_helper_models.php`). You can force No with `--nowrite (-N)`.\nPlease make sure to backup your models, before writing the info.\nIt should keep the existing comments and only append new properties/methods. The existing phpdoc is replaced, or added if not found.\nWith the `--reset (-R)` option, the existing phpdocs are ignored, and only the newly found columns/relations are saved as phpdocs.\n\n```bash\nphp artisan ide-helper:models Post\n```\n\n```php\n/**\n * An Eloquent Model: \'Post\'\n *\n * @property integer $id\n * @property integer $author_id\n * @property string $title\n * @property string $text\n * @property \\Illuminate\\Support\\Carbon $created_at\n * @property \\Illuminate\\Support\\Carbon $updated_at\n * @property-read \\User $author\n * @property-read \\Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Collection|\\Comment[] $comments\n */\n```\n\nBy default, models in `app/models` are scanned. The optional argument tells what models to use (also outside app/models).\n\n```bash\nphp artisan ide-helper:models Post User\n```\n\nYou can also scan a different directory, using the `--dir` option (relative from the base path):\n\n```bash\nphp artisan ide-helper:models --dir="path/to/models" --dir="app/src/Model"\n```\n\nYou can publish the config file (`php artisan vendor:publish`) and set the default directories.\n\nModels can be ignored using the `--ignore (-I)` option\n\n```bash\nphp artisan ide-helper:models --ignore="Post,User"\n```\n\nNote: With namespaces, wrap your model name in double-quotes (`"`): `php artisan ide-helper:models "API\\User"`, or escape the slashes (`Api\\\\User`)\n\nFor properly recognition of `Model` methods (i.e. `paginate`, `findOrFail`) you should extend `\\Eloquent` or add\n```php\n/** @mixin \\Eloquent */\n```\nfor your model class.\n\n### Automatic phpDocs generation for Laravel Fluent methods\nIf you need phpDocs support for Fluent methods in migration, for example\n```php\n$table->string("somestring")->nullable()->index();\n```\nAfter publishing vendor, simply change the `include_fluent` line your `config/ide-helper.php` file into:\n```php\n\'include_fluent\' => true,\n```\nAnd then run `php artisan ide-helper:generate` , you will now see all of the Fluent methods are recognized by your IDE.\n\n\n### Auto-completion for factory builders\n\nIf you would like the `factory()->create()` and `factory()->make()` methods to return the correct model class,\nyou can enable custom factory builders with the `include_factory_builders` line your `config/ide-helper.php` file.\n\n```php\n\'include_factory_builders\' => true,\n```\n\nFor this to work, you must also publish the PhpStorm Meta file (see below). \n\n\n## PhpStorm Meta for Container instances\n\nIt\'s possible to generate a PhpStorm meta file to [add support for factory design pattern](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/PhpStorm+Advanced+Metadata). For Laravel, this means we can make PhpStorm understand what kind of object we are resolving from the IoC Container. For example, `events` will return an `Illuminate\\Events\\Dispatcher` object, so with the meta file you can call `app(\'events\')` and it will autocomplete the Dispatcher methods.\n\n``` bash\nphp artisan ide-helper:meta\n```\n\n```php\napp(\'events\')->fire();\n\\App::make(\'events\')->fire();\n\n/** @var \\Illuminate\\Foundation\\Application $app */\n$app->make(\'events\')->fire();\n\n// When the key is not found, it uses the argument as class name\napp(\'App\\SomeClass\');\n```\n\nPre-generated example: https://gist.github.com/barryvdh/bb6ffc5d11e0a75dba67\n\n> Note: You might need to restart PhpStorm and make sure `.phpstorm.meta.php` is indexed.\n> Note: When you receive a FatalException about a class that is not found, check your config (for example, remove S3 as cloud driver when you don\'t have S3 configured. Remove Redis ServiceProvider when you don\'t use it).\n\n## Lumen Install\n\nThis package is focused on Laravel development, but it can also be used in Lumen with some workarounds. Because Lumen works a little different, as it is like a barebone version of Laravel and the main configuration parameters are instead located in `bootstrap/app.php`, some alterations must be made.\n\n#### Enabling Facades\n\nWhile Laravel IDE Helper can generate automatically default Facades for code hinting, Lumen doesn\'t come with Facades activated. If you plan in using them, you must enable them under the `Create The Application` section, uncommenting this line:\n\n```php\n// $app->withFacades();\n```\n\nFrom there, you should be able to use the `create_alias()` function to add additional Facades into your application.\n\n#### Adding the Service Provider\n\nYou can install Laravel IDE Helper in `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`, and uncommenting this line that registers the App Service Providers so it can properly load.\n\n```php\n// $app->register(App\\Providers\\AppServiceProvider::class);\n```\n\nIf you are not using that line, that is usually handy to manage gracefully multiple Laravel/Lumen installations, you will have to add this line of code under the `Register Service Providers` section of your `bootstrap/app.php`.\n\n```php\nif ($app->environment() !== \'production\') {\n    $app->register(\\Barryvdh\\LaravelIdeHelper\\IdeHelperServiceProvider::class);\n}\n```\n\nAfter that, Laravel IDE Helper should work correctly. During the generation process, the script may throw exceptions saying that some Class(s) doesn\'t exist or there are some undefined indexes. This is normal, as Lumen has some default packages stripped away, like Cookies, Storage and Session. If you plan to add these packages, you will have to add them manually and create additional Facades if needed.\n\n#### Adding Additional Facades\n\nCurrently Lumen IDE Helper doesn\'t take into account additional Facades created under `bootstrap/app.php` using `create_alias()`, so you need to create a `config/app.php` file and add your custom aliases under an `aliases` array again, like so:\n\n```php\nreturn [\n    \'aliases\' => [\n        \'CustomAliasOne\' => Example\\Support\\Facades\\CustomAliasOne::class,\n        \'CustomAliasTwo\' => Example\\Support\\Facades\\CustomAliasTwo::class,\n        //...\n    ]\n];\n```\n\nAfter you run ```php artisan ide-helper:generate```, it\'s recommended (but not mandatory) to rename `config/app.php` to something else until you have to re-generate the docs or after passing to production enviroment. Lumen 5.1+ will read this file for configuration parameters if it is present, and may overlap some configurations if it is completely populated.\n\n### License\n\nThe Laravel IDE Helper Generator is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n\n[ico-version]: https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper.svg?style=flat-square\n[ico-license]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[ico-travis]: https://img.shields.io/travis/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper/master.svg?style=flat-square\n[ico-scrutinizer]: https://img.shields.io/scrutinizer/coverage/g/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper.svg?style=flat-square\n[ico-code-quality]: https://img.shields.io/scrutinizer/g/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper.svg?style=flat-square\n[ico-downloads]: https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper.svg?style=flat-square\n\n[link-packagist]: https://packagist.org/packages/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper\n[link-travis]: https://travis-ci.org/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper\n[link-scrutinizer]: https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper/code-structure\n[link-code-quality]: https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper\n[link-downloads]: https://packagist.org/packages/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper\n[link-author]: https://github.com/barryvdh\n[link-contributors]: ../../contributors\n'
