It\'s based on the PHP Laravel Framework. You can use Microweber to make any kind of website, online store, and blog. The Drag and Drop technology allows you to build your website without any technical knowledge.\n\nThe core idea of the software is to let you create your own website, online shop or blog. From this moment of creation, your journey towards success begins. Supporting you along the way will be different modules, customizations and features of the CMS. Many of them are specifically tailored for e-commerce enthusiasts and bloggers.\n\nThe most important thing you need to know is that Microweber pairs the latest Drag & Drop technology, with a revolutionary Real-Time Text Writing & Editing feature. This pair of features delivers an improved user experience, easier and quicker content management, a visually appealing environment, and flexibility.\n\n\n## Core features of Microweber  \n\n\n#### Drag & Drop\n\nMicroweber implements Drag & Drop technology. This means that users can manage their content and arrange elements with just a click of the mouse, dragging and dropping them across the screen. Drag & Drop applies to all types of content: images, text fields, videos, and the various modules and customization options you have as a user. The default template \xe2\x80\x9cDream\xe2\x80\x9d comes with more than 75+ prepared layouts that you can use via drag and drop.\n\n![Drag And Drop](https://microweber.com/cdn/2019_version/Drag_Drop_CMS_Microweber.gif "")\n\n\n\n#### Real Time Text Editing\n\nLive Edit view is the manifestation of the Real-Time Text Writing & Editing core feature of Microweber CMS. Live Edit view changes your website\xe2\x80\x99s interface in real time.\n\n![E-commerce solution](https://sitestatic.microweber.com/cdn/gh_readme/homepage-2018-third-section.gif "")\n\n\n\n#### Powerful Admin Panel\n\nYou can add dynamic pages, posts, and products. All of these can be organized in custom categories in order to achieve a better navigation and showcase of a website\'s content. New pages can be created using different layouts. In addition, all pages, posts and products come with a number of preset layouts and modules to get users started. These modules can be changed and you can add your own custom set of modules in order to create the most suitable content for your needs.\n\n![Powerful Admin Panel](https://microweber.com/cdn/2019_version/2.jpg "")\n\n\n\n#### E-commerce Solution\n\nThe main focus of Microweber CMS is E-commerce. A rising number of people have grown fond of the idea of online entrepreneurship and we aspire to cover their needs. The software has some built-in features that will help online shop founders see their business grow and excel.\n\n![E-commerce Solution](https://microweber.com/cdn/2019_version/3.jpg "")\n\n\n\n\n## See it in action\n\n* [Microweber Live Demo](https://demo.microweber.org/?template=dream)\n* [Microweber Video](https://sitestatic.microweber.com/userfiles/templates/mw/videos/1.mp4)\n* [Deploy as DigitalOcean 1-Click App](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/microweber?action=deploy&refcode=83e0646738fe)\n\n\n\n## Requirements  \n\n* HTTP server  \n* Database server\n* PHP >= 5.6\n  * `lib-xml` must be enabled (with DOM support)\n  * `GD` PHP extension\n\n### HTTP Server\n\n#### Apache\nThe `mod_rewrite` module must be enabled in your Apache configuration. Microweber creates the necessary `.htaccess` files during installation, including one with `Deny All` directive in each folder to ensure that there are no entry points other than `index.php`.\n\n#### nginx\nAdd this `location` directive to your `server` configuration block. The `root` directive must point to the base folder of your Microweber website (which by default is where this readme is located).\n```\nserver {\n  location / {\n    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### IIS\n\nYou can easily [import the `.htaccess` rewrite rules](http://www.iis.net/learn/extensions/url-rewrite-module/importing-apache-modrewrite-rules). Make sure you have enabled [the URL Rewrite module](http://www.iis.net/learn/extensions/url-rewrite-module/using-the-url-rewrite-module) for your website.\n\n### Database\nYou have several choices for database engine: MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL.\nFor small websites we highly recommend SQLite.\nHowever, you can connect to more storage services (like [MongoDB](https://github.com/jenssegers/laravel-mongodb) or [Neo4j](https://github.com/Vinelab/NeoEloquent)) and take advantage of the Laravel framework.\n\nOn the installation screen you can only choose from databases enabled in your PHP configuration.\nIf you don\'t see your server of choice in the list you have to enable the corresponding [PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) extension for your database server. [An example for Microsoft SQL Server](http://php.net/manual/en/mssql.installation.php). PHP usually comes with PDO enabled by default but you might have to uncomment or add `extension` directives to your `php.ini`.\n\n## Installation  \n\n### The fast way: [Download](https://microweber.com/download.php) and unzip.\n\n### Via Composer\n\n#### Installing dependencies\n\nYou need to [have Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) in order to download Microweber\'s dependencies.\n\nYou can clone and install Microweber with one command:\n`composer create-project microweber/microweber my_site dev-master --prefer-dist --no-dev`\nThis will install Microweber in a folder named `my_site`.\n\nAnother way is to first clone the repository and then run `composer install` in the base directory.\n\n#### File permissions\nMake sure these folders, and everything inside, is writeable by the user executing the PHP scripts:\n* config/\n* src/\n* storage/\n* userfiles/\n\n## Getting Started  \n\nSee the [online guides](http://microweber.com/docs/guides/README.md) for developers.\n\n## Contribute\nWe are looking for people who want to help us improve Microweber.\n\nIf you are a developer, submitting fixes is easy.
