Canvas is a fully open source package to extend your \napplication and get you up-and-running with a blog in just a few minutes. In addition to a distraction-free \nwriting experience, you can view monthly trends on your content, get insights into reader traffic and more!\n\n## Installation\n\n> **Note:** Canvas requires you to have user authentication in place prior to installation. You may run the `make:auth` Artisan command to satisfy this requirement.\n\nYou may use composer to install Canvas into your Laravel project:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require cnvs/canvas\n```\n\nPublish the assets and primary configuration file using the `canvas:install` Artisan command:\n\n```bash\nphp artisan canvas:install\n```\n\nCreate a symbolic link to ensure file uploads are publicly accessible from the web using the `storage:link` Artisan command:\n\n```bash\nphp artisan storage:link\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n> **Note:** The following steps are optional configurations, you are not required to complete them.\n\n**Want to get started fast?** Just run `php artisan canvas:setup` after installing Canvas. A `--data` option may also be included in the command to generate demo data. Then, navigate your browser to `http://your-app.test/blog` or any other URL that is assigned to your application. This command scaffolds a default frontend for your entire blog!\n\n\nIf you want to include [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) images in your post content, set up a new application at [https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications). Grab your access key and update `config/canvas.php`:\n\n```php\n\'unsplash\' => [\n    \'access_key\' => env(\'CANVAS_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY\'),\n],\n```\n\n**Want a weekly summary?** Canvas provides support for a weekly e-mail that gives you quick stats of the content you\'ve authored, delivered straight to your inbox. Once your application is [configured for sending mail](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/mail), update `config/canvas.php`:\n\n```php\n\'mail\' => [\n    \'enabled\' => env(\'CANVAS_MAIL_ENABLED\', false),\n],\n```\n\nSince the weekly digest runs on [Laravel\'s Scheduler](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/scheduling#introduction), you\'ll need to add the following cron entry to your server:\n\n```bash\n* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1\n```\n\n## Updates\n\nYou may update your Canvas installation using composer:\n\n```bash\ncomposer update\n```\n\nRun any new migrations using the `migrate` Artisan command:\n\n```bash\nphp artisan migrate\n```\n\nRe-publish the assets using the `canvas:publish` Artisan command:\n\n```bash\nphp artisan canvas:publish\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nRun the tests with:\n\n```bash\ncomposer test\n```\n\n## License\n\nCanvas is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n## Credits\n\n- [The team](https://github.com/orgs/cnvs/people) that continues to support and develop this project\n- Thanks to [Mohamed Said](https://themsaid.com/) and his project [Wink](https://github.com/writingink/wink) for inspring much of the design\n- Anyone who has [contributed a patch](https://github.com/cnvs/canvas/pulls) or [made a helpful suggestion](https://github.com/cnvs/canvas/issues)\n'
