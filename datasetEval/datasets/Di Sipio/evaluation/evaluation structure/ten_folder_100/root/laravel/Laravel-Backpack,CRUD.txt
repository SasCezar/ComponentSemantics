Minor versions include minor breaking changes. This allows us to push new features without charging our users again. For us, this is what ```major.minor.patch``` means:\n\n- ```major``` - **PAID upgrade; MAJOR breaking changes;** historically every 2-3 years; upgrading may take even 2-3 hours; includes major new features, major changes in how the whole system works, and complete rewrites; it allows us to _considerably_ improve the product, and add features that were previously impossible;\n- ```minor``` - **FREE upgrade; MINOR breaking changes**; historically every 6-12 months; upgrading takes less than 30 minutes; it allows us to add big new features, for free;\n- ```patch``` - **FREE upgrade; NO breaking changes**; historically every week; upgrading can be done automatically with composer; includes bug fixes and non-breaking new features;\n\n## Hire us\n\nWe\'ve spend more than 10.000 hours creating, polishing and maintaining administration panels on Laravel. We\'ve developed e-Commerce, e-Learning, ERPs, social networks, payment gateways and much more. We\'ve worked on admin panels _so much_, that we\'ve created one of the most popular packages for Laravel - just from making public what was repetitive in our projects.\n\nIf you are looking for a developer/team to help you build an admin panel on Laravel, look no further. You\'ll have a difficult time finding someone with more experience & enthusiasm for admin panels. This is _what we do_.
