The talk was recorded and published [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtB_rTh61Zo).\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall this package by running cloning this repository and install like you normally install Laravel.\n\n- Run `composer install` and `npm install yarn`\n- Run `yarn` and `yarn run dev` to generate assets\n- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill your values (`php artisan key:generate`, database, pusher values etc)\n- Run `php artisan migrate --seed`, this will seed a user based on your `BASIC_AUTH` `.env` values\n- Start your queue listener and setup the Laravel scheduler.\n- Open the dashboard in your browser, login and wait for the update events to fill the dashboard.\n\n## Postcardware\n\nIf you are using our dashboard, please send us a postcard from your hometown.\n\nOur address is: Spatie, Samberstraat 69D, 2060 Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nAll postcards are published [on our website](https://spatie.be/en/opensource/postcards).\n\n## Support\nThis dashboard is tailormade to be displayed on the wall mounted tv in our office.
