b'# Redux Ecosystem Links\nA categorized list of addon libraries for Redux, as well as other libraries that are closely related.\n\nThis page overlaps with the [Ecosystem page](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Ecosystem.html) in the Redux documentation, and the [Awesome-Redux](https://github.com/xgrommx/awesome-redux) list, but is much more comprehensive and includes more categories.\n\nItems listed in a category are generally in no specific order - just whatever sequence I happened to add them in.\n\nYou may also be interested in my [React/Redux tutorials and resources collection](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n#### Core Redux Concepts\n\n- [Reducers](./reducers.md)\n- [Actions](./actions.md)\n- [Store](./store.md)\n  - [Store - Persistence](store-persistence.md)\n- [Action/Reducer/Constant Generators](./action-reducer-generators.md)\n\n#### Advanced/Additional Redux Concepts\n\n- [Immutable Data](./immutable-data.md)\n- [Middleware](./middleware.md)\n  - [Middleware - Async Behavior](middleware-async.md)\n  - [Middleware - Network Requests](middleware-network-requests.md)\n  - [Middleware - Sockets and Adapters](middleware-sockets-adapters.md)\n- [Side Effects](./side-effects.md)\n  - [Side Effects - Functions](side-effects-functions.md)\n  - [Side Effects - Generators](side-effects-generators.md)\n  - [Side Effects - Observables](side-effects-observables.md)\n  - [Side Effects - Reducers/Other](side-effects-other.md)\n- [Dev Tools](devtools.md)\n- [Testing](testing.md)\n- [Entity/Collection Management](entity-collection-management.md)\n- [Prebuilt Use Cases and Integration](use-cases.md)\n- [Utilities](utilities.md)\n- [Other Redux Resources](other-resources.md)\n\n#### Components and UI\n\n- [Component/Local State](component-state.md)\n- [Component Data Fetching and Preloading](component-data-fetching-preloading.md)\n- [Widgets](widgets.md)\n- [Forms](forms.md)\n- [Routing](routing.md)\n\n#### Redux-Based Libraries and Apps\n\n- [Applications and Examples](apps-and-examples.md)\n- [Project Scaffolding and CLIs](project-scaffolding.md)\n- [Library Integration and Bindings](./library-integration.md)\n- [Alternate Approaches and Variations](variations.md)\n'
