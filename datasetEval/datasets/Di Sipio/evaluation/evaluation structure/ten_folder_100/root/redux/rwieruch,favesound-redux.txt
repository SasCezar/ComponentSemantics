Clone Repository: `git clone git@github.com:rwieruch/favesound-redux.git`\n2. `npm install`\n3. `npm start`\n4. visit http://localhost:8080/\n4. `npm test`\n\n## Contribute\n\nI am looking actively for contributors to make this project awesome!\n\nI wouldn't want to extend the project with new routes like: that's my profile page and that's my favorite track page. Rather I see more value in improving the status quo of the app: Improving the player, the playlist or the interaction overall. I would love to see a GitHub issue to see where you want to work on. Moreover I will try to find the time to raise some more issues where people can contribute. At the end it is a perfect project to get started in open source!\n\n## Improve\n\nFeedback is more than appreciated via [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch)\n"
