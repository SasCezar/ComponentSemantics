b"# Announcement\n### Jumpsuit is now officially *DEPRECATED*. Thanks for your support over the life of Jumpsuit. It served a great purpose, but we now are strongly urging you to use idiomatic (vanilla) redux in conjunction with redux-thunk. It will most certainly improve your apps testability, stability, and scalability.\n\n### Documentation is still provided for your convenience:\n\n- [Introduction](https://jumpsuit.js.org/introduction.html)\n- [Getting Started](https://jumpsuit.js.org/getting-started.html)\n- [Learn the Basics](https://jumpsuit.js.org/learn-the-basics.html)\n- [Effects](https://jumpsuit.js.org/effects.html)\n- [Hooks](https://jumpsuit.js.org/hooks.html)\n- [Sandboxed States](https://jumpsuit.js.org/sandboxed-states.html)\n- [Hot State Reloading (HSR)](https://jumpsuit.js.org/hot-state-reloading.md)\n- [Tutorial](https://jumpsuit.js.org/tutorial.html)\n- [Examples](https://jumpsuit.js.org/examples.html)\n- [API](https://jumpsuit.js.org/api.html)\n- [FAQ](https://jumpsuit.js.org/faq.html)\n- [Changelog](https://jumpsuit.js.org/changelog.html)\n- [Jumpstate](https://github.com/jumpsuit/jumpstate)\n\n## Need some consolation?
