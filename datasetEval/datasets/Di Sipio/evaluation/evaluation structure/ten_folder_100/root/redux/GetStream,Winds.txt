Ubuntu users can use `apt`, and Windows users will have to install directly from the dependency\'s site. Non-debian-based Linux users will probably be able to figure it out on their own :)\n\n*   `cd Winds/app`\n*   `yarn`\n*   `cd ../api`\n*   `yarn`\n\n### Start MongoDB Locally\n\nWinds uses MongoDB as the main datastore - it contains all users, rss feeds, podcasts, episodes, articles, and shares.\n\nIf you\'re on a Mac, you can install MongoDB through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by running:\n\n```\nbrew install mongodb\n```\n\n_(You can also install MongoDB from the [official MongoDB site](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center).)_\n\nYou can also run MongoDB in the background by running:\n\n```\nbrew services start mongodb\n```\n\n### Start Redis Locally\n\nAt Stream, we use Redis as an in-memory storage for the Winds podcast processing and RSS processing workers. It contains a list of podcasts and RSS feeds, which the workers pick up and process using the `bull` messaging system.\n\nIf you\'re on a Mac, you can install Redis through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by running:\n\n```\nbrew install redis\n```\n\n_(You can also install Redis from the [official Redis site](https://redis.io/download).)_\n\nThen, start Redis by running:\n\n```\nredis-server\n```\n\n...which creates (by default) a `dump.rdb` file in your current directory and stores a cached version of the database in that location.\n\nYou can also run Redis in the background by running:\n\n```\nbrew services start redis\n```\n\n### Loading Test Data\n\nFor testing purposes, you will want to use the test data located [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/winds-hosted/static/export/WINDS.zip).\n\nUse [`mongoimport`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongoimport/) or [`mongorestore`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/) to import the data. There are two username and password combinations for testing:\n\n**Username**: `admin@admin.com`<br/>\n**Password**: `admin`\n<br/><br/>\n**Username**: `test@test.com`<br/>\n**Password**: `test`\n\nYou will need to run the `FLUSHALL` command in Redis to ensure that the new content is picked up.\n\n> Note: This will override any local data that you may have. Please be cautious! Also, this will not create Stream follows \xe2\x80\x93 please follow feeds manually to generate them.\n\n### Stream\n\n#### Sign up and Create a Stream App\n\nTo contribute to Winds, sign up for [Stream](https://getstream.io/get_started?ref=winds) to utilize the activity and timeline feeds.\n\n_(Reminder: Stream is free for applications with less than 3,000,000 updates per month.)_\n\n*   [Sign up for Stream here](https://getstream.io/get_started?ref=winds)\n*   Create a new Stream app\n*   Find the App ID, API Key, and API Secret for your new Stream app\n\n#### Add your Stream App ID, API Key, and API Secret to your `.env`\n\nAppend the Stream App ID, API Key, and API secret to your `.env` file:\n\n```\nSTREAM_APP_ID=YOUR_STREAM_APP_ID\nSTREAM_API_KEY=YOUR_STREAM_API_KEY\nSTREAM_API_SECRET=YOUR_STREAM_API_SECRET\n```\n\n#### Create Your Stream Feed Groups\n\nOnce you\'ve signed in, create "feed groups" for your Stream app.\n\nA "feed group" defines a certain type of feed within your application. Use the "Add Feed Group" button to create the following feeds:\n\n| Feed Group Name | Feed Group Type |\n| --------------- | --------------- |\n| `podcast`       | flat            |\n| `rss`           | flat            |\n| `user`          | flat            |\n| `timeline`      | flat            |\n| `folder`        | flat            |\n| `user_episode`  | flat            |\n| `user_article`  | flat            |\n\nIt\'s fine to enable "Realtime Notifications" for each of these feed groups, though we won\'t be using those yet.\n\n### Algolia\n\n#### Sign up for Algolia and Create an Algolia App and Index\n\nIn addition to Stream, you also need to sign up for [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up?ref=winds), to contribute to Winds, for the search functionality.\n\n_(Algolia is free for applications with up to 10k records.)_\n\n*   [Sign up for Algolia here](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up?ref=winds)\n*   From the [Applications page](https://www.algolia.com/manage/applications), click "New Application" and create a new Algolia application. (We recommend something similar to `my-winds-app`)\n    *   (Select the datacenter that\'s closest to you.)\n*   From the application page, select "Indices" and click "Add New Index". (We recommend something similar to `winds-main-index`)\n\n#### Add Your Algolia Application Id, Search-Only Api Key and Admin Api Key to Your `.env` File\n\nFrom your app, click the "API Keys" button on the left to find your app ID and API keys.\n\nAppend your Algolia application ID, search-only API Key and Admin API Key to your `.env` file to look like this:\n\n```\nREACT_APP_ALGOLIA_APP_ID=YOUR_ALGOLIA_APP_ID\nREACT_APP_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY=YOUR_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY\nALGOLIA_WRITE_KEY=YOUR_ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY\n```\n\n### Start Backend Services\n\nFrom the root directory, run:\n\n```\npm2 start process_dev.json\n```\n\nTo see logging information for all processes, run:\n\n```\npm2 logs\n```\n\n### Start Frontend Electron / Web App Server\n\n```\ncd app && yarn start\n```\n\n### Running tests\n\nWinds API server uses:\n\n* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) as testing framework\n* [Chai](https://chaijs.org) as assertion library\n* [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org) as mocking library\n* [nock](https://github.com/node-nock/nock) as HTTP mocking library\n* [mock-require](https://github.com/boblauer/mock-require) as module mocking library\n\nTests are located in [`api/test` folder](https://github.com/GetStream/Winds/tree/master/api/test).\n\nFile structure is intentionally mirroring files in `api/src` to simplify matching tests to tested code.\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```\ncd api && yarn run test\n```\n\nTo run tests with extended stack traces (useful when debugging async issues):\n\n```\ncd api && yarn run test_deep\n```\n\n#### Adding new tests\n\nAdd your code to a file in `api/test` folder (preferably mirroring existing file from `api/src` folder).\n\nRefer to [Mocha documentation](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started) for examples of using BDD-like DSL for writing tests.\n\nModules are mocked in [`api/test-entry.js`](https://github.com/GetStream/Winds/blob/master/api/test-entry.js#L21L27) as mocks have to be installed before any modules are loaded.\n\nFixtures are loaded via [`loadFixture`](https://github.com/GetStream/Winds/blob/master/api/test/utils.js#L59L101) function from [`api/test/fixtures` folder](https://github.com/GetStream/Winds/tree/master/api/test/fixtures)\n\nVarious utility functions are provided in [`api/test/util.js`](https://github.com/GetStream/Winds/blob/master/api/test/utils.js) (See other tests for examples of usage).\n\n### Building a Production Version\n\nBuild a production version of Winds by running from root directory:\n\n```\n./api/build.sh\n```\n\nThis creates production-ready JS files in api/dist.\n\nTo run the production JS files:\n\n```\npm2 start process_prod.json\n```\n\nOR\n\n**Prepare the build for Docker**:\n\n`cd api && cd scripts && ./make-build.sh`\n\n**Build the Docker container (API & all workers)**:\n\n`cd ../ && docker-compose up`\n\nThe commands above will prepare and start the API (and all workers). The frontend will still need to be started manually.\n\n## Debugging RSS & Podcast Issues\n\nUnfortunately there is no unified standard for RSS.\nGo to the `api` directory and run `yarn link` to make these commands available:\n\n```\nwinds rss https://techcrunch.com/feed/\n```\n\n**Podcasts**:\n\n```\nwinds podcast https://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php\\?id\\=510289\n```\n\n**Open Graph scraping**:\n\n```\nwinds og http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/planetary-radio/show/2018/0509-amy-mainzer-neowise.html\n```\n\n**RSS Discovery**:\n\n```\nwinds discover mashable.com\n```\n\n**Article parsing (w/ Mercury)**:\n\n```\nwinds article https://alexiskold.net/2018/04/12/meet-12-startups-from-techstars-nyc-winter-2018-program/\n```\n\nPull requests for improved RSS compatibility are much appreciated.\nMost of the parsing codebase is located in `api/src/parsers/`.\n\n## Support\n\nAll support is handled via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/getstream/winds/issues). If you\'re unfamiliar with creating an Issue on GitHub, please follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).\n\n## Maintenance and Contributions\n\nThank you to all of the maintainers and contributors who\'ve helped Winds become what it is today and help it stay up and running every day.
