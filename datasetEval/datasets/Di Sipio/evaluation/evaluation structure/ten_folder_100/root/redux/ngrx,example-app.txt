Using the Google Books API, the user can search for\nbooks and add them to their collection. This application utilizes [@ngrx/db](https://github.com/ngrx/db)\nto persist the collection across sessions; [@ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store) to manage\nthe state of the app and to cache requests made to the Google Books API;\n[@angular/router](https://github.com/angular/angular) to manage navigation between routes;\n[@ngrx/effects](https://github.com/ngrx/effects) to isolate side effects.\n\nBuilt with [@angular/cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)\n\n### Included\n - [ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store) - RxJS powered state management for Angular apps, inspired by Redux\n - [ngrx/effects](https://github.com/ngrx/effects) - Side effect model for @ngrx/store\n - [angular/router](https://github.com/angular/angular) - Angular Router\n - [ngrx/db](https://github.com/ngrx/db) - RxJS powered IndexedDB for Angular apps\n - [ngrx/store-devtools](https://github.com/ngrx/store-devtools) - Instrumentation for @ngrx/store enabling time-travel debugging\n - [codewareio/ngrx-store-freeze](https://github.com/codewareio/ngrx-store-freeze) - A @ngrx/store meta reducer that prevents state from being mutated\n - [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) - Selector library for Redux\n\n### Quick start\n\n```bash\n# clone the repo\ngit clone https://github.com/ngrx/example-app.git\n\n\n# change directory to repo\ncd example-app\n\n# Use npm or yarn to install the dependencies:\nnpm install\n\n# OR\nyarn\n\n# start the server\nng serve\n```\n\nNavigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) in your browser\n\n_NOTE:_ The above setup instructions assume you have added local npm bin folders to your path.\nIf this is not the case you will need to install the Angular CLI globally.\n'
