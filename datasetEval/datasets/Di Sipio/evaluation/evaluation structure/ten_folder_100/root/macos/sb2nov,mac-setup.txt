Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this guide is intended\nfor everyone to use as a reference for setting up your environment or\ninstalling languages/libraries.\n\n[![Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sb2nov/mac-setup/master/assets/intro.gif)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sb2nov/mac-setup/master/assets/intro.gif)\n\nSome of the environments we will set up are [Node](https://nodejs.org)\n(JavaScript), [Python](https://www.python.org),\n[C++](http://www.cplusplus.com) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org).\nEven if you don't program in all of them, they are useful to have as many\ncommand-line tools rely on them. We'll also show you some useful daily use\napplications. As you read and follow these steps, feel free to post any\nfeedback or comments you may have.\n\n## Contributing to the guide\n\nAll contributions to the guide are welcome. Please help add support for other\nlibraries and languages. To make a contribution please use our [contribution\ntemplate](https://github.com/sb2nov/mac-setup/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTION_TEMPLATE.md).\n\n**We're looking for more contributors to maintain and extend the\ndocumentation.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis guide is [MIT\nlicensed](https://github.com/sb2nov/mac-setup/blob/master/LICENSE) and has been\ngenerated using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/).
