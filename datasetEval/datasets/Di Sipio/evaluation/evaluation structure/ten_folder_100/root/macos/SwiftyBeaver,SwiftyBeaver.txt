For Swift 2.3 [use this Gist](https://gist.github.com/skreutzberger/7c396573796473ed1be2c6d15cafed34). **No need to hack Xcode 8 anymore** to get color. You can even customize the log level word (ATTENTION instead of ERROR maybe?), the general amount of displayed data and if you want to use the \xf0\x9f\x92\x9cs or replace them with something else \xf0\x9f\x98\x89\n\n<br/>\n\n### During Development: Colored Logging to File\n\n<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/564725/18608325/b7ecd4c2-7ce6-11e6-829b-7f8f9fe6ef2f.png" width="738">\n\n[Learn more](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com/article/10-log-to-file) about logging to file which is great for Terminal.app fans or to store logs on disk.\n\n<br/>\n\n\n### On Release: Encrypted Logging to SwiftyBeaver Platform\n\n<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/564725/14281408/38d6a6ba-fb39-11e5-9584-34e3679bb1c5.jpg" width="700">\n\n[Learn more](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com/article/11-log-to-swiftybeaver-platform) about logging to the SwiftyBeaver Platform **during release!**\n\n<br/>\n\n\n### Browse, Search & Filter via Mac App\n\n![swiftybeaver-demo1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/564725/14846071/218c0646-0c62-11e6-92cb-e6e963b68724.gif)\n\nConveniently access your logs during development & release with our [free Mac App](https://swiftybeaver.com).\n\n<br/>\n\n\n### On Release: Enterprise-ready Logging to Your Elasticsearch & Kibana (on-premise)\n\n<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/564725/34486363-dc501aec-efcf-11e7-92b2-1163cca9e7aa.jpg" width="700">\n\n[Learn more](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com/article/34-enterprise-quick-start-via-docker) about **legally compliant**, end-to-end encrypted logging to Elasticsearch with **SwiftyBeaver Enterprise**. Install via Docker or manual, fully-featured free trial included!\n\n<br/>\n\n### Google Cloud & More\n\nYou can fully customize your log format, turn it into JSON, or create your own destinations. For example our [Google Cloud Destination](https://github.com/SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver/blob/master/Sources/GoogleCloudDestination.swift) is just another customized logging format which adds the powerful functionality of automatic server-side Swift logging when hosted on Google Cloud Platform.\n\n<br/>\n\n----\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## Installation\n\n- For **Swift 3, 4 & 5** install the latest SwiftyBeaver version\n- For **Swift 2** install SwiftyBeaver 0.7.0\n\n<br/>\n\n### Carthage\n\nYou can use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to install SwiftyBeaver by adding that to your Cartfile:\n\nSwift 3, 4 & 5:\n``` Swift\ngithub "SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver"\n```\n\nSwift 2:\n``` Swift\ngithub "SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver" ~> 0.7\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nFor [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) add the following package to your Package.swift file. Just Swift 3, 4 & 5 are supported:\n\n``` Swift\n.package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.7.0")),\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n### CocoaPods\n\nTo use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) just add this to your Podfile:\n\nSwift 3, 4 & 5:\n``` Swift\npod \'SwiftyBeaver\'\n```\n\nSwift 2:\n``` Ruby\ntarget \'MyProject\' do\n  use_frameworks!\n\n  # Pods for MyProject\n  pod \'SwiftyBeaver\', \'~> 0.7\'\nend\n\npost_install do |installer|\n  installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|\n    # Configure Pod targets for Xcode 8 with Swift 2.3\n    config.build_settings[\'SWIFT_VERSION\'] = \'2.3\'\n  end\nend\n```\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd that near the top of your `AppDelegate.swift` to be able to use SwiftyBeaver in your whole project.\n\n``` Swift\nimport SwiftyBeaver\nlet log = SwiftyBeaver.self\n\n```\n\nAt the the beginning of your `AppDelegate:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()` add the SwiftyBeaver log destinations (console, file, etc.), optionally adjust the [log format](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com//article/20-custom-format) and then you can already do the following log level calls globally:\n\n``` Swift\n// add log destinations. at least one is needed!\nlet console = ConsoleDestination()  // log to Xcode Console\nlet file = FileDestination()  // log to default swiftybeaver.log file\nlet cloud = SBPlatformDestination(appID: "foo", appSecret: "bar", encryptionKey: "123") // to cloud\n\n// use custom format and set console output to short time, log level & message\nconsole.format = "$DHH:mm:ss$d $L $M"\n// or use this for JSON output: console.format = "$J"\n\n// add the destinations to SwiftyBeaver\nlog.addDestination(console)\nlog.addDestination(file)\nlog.addDestination(cloud)\n\n// Now let\xe2\x80\x99s log!\nlog.verbose("not so important")  // prio 1, VERBOSE in silver\nlog.debug("something to debug")  // prio 2, DEBUG in green\nlog.info("a nice information")   // prio 3, INFO in blue\nlog.warning("oh no, that won\xe2\x80\x99t be good")  // prio 4, WARNING in yellow\nlog.error("ouch, an error did occur!")  // prio 5, ERROR in red\n\n// log anything!\nlog.verbose(123)\nlog.info(-123.45678)\nlog.warning(Date())\nlog.error(["I", "like", "logs!"])\nlog.error(["name": "Mr Beaver", "address": "7 Beaver Lodge"])\n\n// optionally add context to a log message\nconsole.format = "$L: $M $X"\nlog.debug("age", 123)  // "DEBUG: age 123"\nlog.info("my data", context: [1, "a", 2]) // "INFO: my data [1, \\"a\\", 2]"\n\n```\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## Server-side Swift\n\nWe \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f server-side Swift 3, 4 & 5 and SwiftyBeaver supports it **out-of-the-box**! Try for yourself and run SwiftyBeaver inside a Ubuntu Docker container. Just install Docker and then go to your the project folder on macOS or Ubuntu and type:\n\n```shell\n# create docker image, build SwiftyBeaver and run unit tests\nswift build --clean && docker build --rm -t swiftybeaver .\n\n# optionally log into container to run Swift CLI and do more stuff\ndocker run --rm -it --privileged=true -v $PWD:/app swiftybeaver\n```\n\nBest: for the popular server-side Swift web framework [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) you can use **[our Vapor logging provider](https://github.com/SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver-Vapor)** which makes server logging awesome again \xf0\x9f\x99\x8c\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## Documentation\n\n**Getting Started:**\n\n- [Features](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com/article/7-introduction)\n- [Installation](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com/article/5-installation)\n- [Basic Setup](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com/article/6-basic-setup)\n\n**Logging Destinations:**\n\n- [Colored Logging to Xcode Console](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com/article/9-log-to-xcode-console)\n- [Colored Logging to File](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com/article/10-log-to-file)\n- [Encrypted Logging & Analytics to SwiftyBeaver Platform](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com/article/11-log-to-swiftybeaver-platform)\n- [Encrypted Logging & Analytics to Elasticsearch & Kibana](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com/article/34-enterprise-quick-start-via-docker)\n\n\n**Advanced Topics:**\n\n- [Custom Format & Context](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com/article/20-custom-format)\n- [Filters](http://docs.swiftybeaver.com/article/21-filters)\n\n**Stay Informed:**\n\n- [Official Website](https://swiftybeaver.com))\n- [On Twitter](https://twitter.com/SwiftyBeaver)\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## Privacy\n\n**SwiftyBeaver is not collecting any data without you as a developer knowing about it**. That\'s why it is **open-source** and developed in a simple way to be easy to inspect and check what it is actually doing under the hood.\n\nThe only sending to servers is done if you use the `SBPlatformDestination`. That destination is meant for production logging and on default it sends your logs plus additional device information **end-to-end encrypted** to our cloud service. Our cloud service **can not decrypt the data**.\n\nInstead, you install our Mac App and that Mac App downloads the encrypted logs from the cloud and decrypts and shows them to you. Additionally, the Mac App stores all data that it downloads in a local SQLite database file on your computer so that you actually "physically" own your data.\n\nThe business model of the SwiftyBeaver cloud service is to provide the most secure logging solution in the market. On purpose we do not provide a web UI for you because it would require us to store your encryption key on our servers.\n\n**Only you can see the logging and device data** which is sent from your users\' devices. Our servers just see encrypted data and do not know your decryption key.\n\nSwiftyBeaver is **fully GDPR compliant** due to its focus on encryption and transparency in what data is collected and also meets **Apple\xe2\x80\x99s latest requirements** on the privacy of 3rd party frameworks.\n\nOur Enterprise offering is an even more secure solution where you are not using anymore our cloud service and Mac App but you send your end-to-end encrypted logs directly to your own servers and you store them in your Elasticsearch cluster. The **Enterprise offering is used by health tech** and governmental institutions which require the highest level of privacy and security.\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## License\n\nSwiftyBeaver Framework is released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver/blob/master/LICENSE).\n'
