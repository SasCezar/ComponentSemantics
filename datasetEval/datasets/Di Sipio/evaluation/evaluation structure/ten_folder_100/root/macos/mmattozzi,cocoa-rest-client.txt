b'About\n=================\nCocoaRestClient is a Mac OS X app for testing HTTP/Restful endpoints.\n\nI love curl, but sometimes I need my output XML or JSON pretty printed. I want to be able to save frequent PUT and POST bodies for later and copy and paste from responses easily. Think of this as curl with a light UI.\n\nThe goal of this project is to build a lightweight native Cocoa app for testing and debugging HTTP Restful services.\nThis project was greatly inspired by the Java rest-client (https://code.google.com/archive/p/rest-client).\n\nOfficial project website: http://mmattozzi.github.io/cocoa-rest-client/\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fmmattozzi%2Fcocoa-rest-client.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fmmattozzi%2Fcocoa-rest-client?ref=badge_shield)\n\nDownload\n=================\nIf you\'re not looking to compile from source and only want to use this tool, latest releases are here:\n\n[Download List](https://github.com/mmattozzi/cocoa-rest-client/releases)\n\nYou can also install it through [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as a [cask](https://caskroom.github.io):\n\n```sh\n# install cask if necessary\nbrew tap caskroom/cask\n# install CocoaRestClient\nbrew cask install cocoarestclient\n```\n\nFeatures\n=================\n* Make GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD calls\n* Set request body to arbitrary content\n* Set request headers\n* Edit URL parameters in an easy to read table\n* Set HTTP basic & digest auth\n* Auto-format (pretty print) XML, JSON, and MsgPack responses\n* Some cool Ace Editor themes for syntax highlighting\n* Display response headers\n* Quick save requests in a handy sidebar using folder organization\n* Upload files and form data via multipart/form-data\n* Enter POST/PUT input as raw input or key/value pairs\n* Reports response latency\n* Command-R reloads last request\n* Lightweight: Low real memory usage and < 6mb DMG\n* SSL Support (including untrusted certificates)\n* Optionally follows HTTP redirects\n* Import and export requests\n* New in version 1.4: Uses native macOS tabs and windows.\n* New in version 1.4.3: Generate a unified diff between two response body tabs\n\nScreenshots\n=================\n\n<img src="https://mmattozzi.github.io/cocoa-rest-client/screenshots/screenshot-1.png" width=400/>\n\n*Pretty print JSON content.
