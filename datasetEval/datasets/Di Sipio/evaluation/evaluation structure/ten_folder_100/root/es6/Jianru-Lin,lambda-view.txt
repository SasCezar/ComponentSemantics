b"# lambda-view: A New Tool for Reading JavaScript Code since 2017\n\nlambda-view provides you a better way to READ JavaScript source code. \n\n# What's the difference?\n\nlambda-view is not something like sublime text/atom or what else editor that you have ever seen before:\n\n* It is not a text editor, but a reader (for JavaScript)\n* It understands the grammar of JavaScript, operating on the AST level, not just a simple token level highlighter\n* It transforms and reproduces the source code as needed\n* It is highly optimized for reading, which brings some special layouts and design\n* You can read on ipad (a comfortable way), not only computer\n\n# Read any JavaScript file you'd like to!\n\nYou are not limited to the demos! Just install lambda-view then read any JavaScript file you'd like to!\n\n# Get started in 2 steps\n\nSTEP-1 install it via npm (sudo required maybe):\n\n```\nnpm install -g lambda-view\n```\n\nSTEP-2 use lv command to open any JavaScript file:\n\n```\nlv target.js\n```\n\nThen (if everything is ok), your web browser will be opened automatically and shows you the result. Pretty easy, right? \n\n# Talk to me\n\nI created a gitter chat room here: \n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Jianru-Lin/lambda-view.svg)](https://gitter.im/Jianru-Lin/lambda-view?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\n\n# Helpful tips\n\n### Can I open remote file by URL?\n\nYes, lv command accepts URL:\n\n```\nlv https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js\n```\n\n### Can I open multiple files in one command?\n\nYes, you can provide multiple filenames to lv command:\n\n```\nlv file1.js file2.js file3.js\n```\n\nFurther more, you can use the wildcard (For Linux/Mac only, Not Windows):\n\n```\nlv *.js\n```\n\n### Can I use lambda-view on my iphone/ipad?\n\nYes. \n\nThis is an experimental feature. \n\nlambda-view embeded a small web server which accepts local access only by default. However you can reconfigure it to accept public access. This makes your computer become a web server that can be accessed by your iphone/ipad. \n\nYou can achieve it in 3 steps.\n\nSTEP-1 stop current lambda-view web server:\n\n```\nlv-svr stop\n```\n\nSTEP-2 start lambda-view web server with public mode:\n\n```\nlv-svr start --public --background\n```\n\nSTEP-3 open any JavaScript file you want to read on your iphone/ipad:\n\n```\nlv some-file.js\n```\n\nNow, the web browser will be opened, and you can copy it's URL to your iphone/ipad's safari. Then you can read it. (Your iphone/ipad )\n\nPlease make sure:\n\n* Your computer and your iphone/ipad must connected to the same LAN\n* If there is any firewall enabled on your computer, please configure it to allow public access on TCP port 23400\n\n# Future plans\n\nThis is just a begining. I'll add more features soon. \n"
