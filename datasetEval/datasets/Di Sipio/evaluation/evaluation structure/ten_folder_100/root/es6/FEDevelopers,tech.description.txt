b'> March, 2016: If you\'re on an old version of Jekyll Now and run into a) build warnings or b) syntax highlighting issues caused by [Jekyll 3 and GitHub Pages updates](https://github.com/blog/2100-github-pages-now-faster-and-simpler-with-jekyll-3-0), just :sparkles:[update your _config.yml](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/pull/445/files):sparkles: and you\'ll be set!\n\n# Jekyll Now\n\n**Jekyll** is a static site generator that\'s perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))\n\n**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.\n\n- You don\'t need to touch the command line\n- You don\'t need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:\n- You don\'t need to install runtime dependencies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc\n- If you\'re on Windows, this will make setting up Jekyll a lot easier\n- It\'s easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don\'t like it\n\nIn a few minutes you\'ll be set up with a minimal, responsive blog like the one below giving you more time to spend on writing epic blog posts!\n\n![Jekyll Now Theme Screenshot](/images/jekyll-now-theme-screenshot.jpg "Jekyll Now Theme Screenshot")\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Step 1) Fork Jekyll Now to your User Repository\n\nFork this repo, then rename the repository to yourgithubusername.github.io.\n\nYour Jekyll blog will often be viewable immediately at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> (if it\'s not, you can often force it to build by completing step 2)\n\n![Step 1](/images/step1.gif "Step 1")\n\n### Step 2) Customize and view your site\n\nEnter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the _config.yml file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.\n\nMaking a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it\'ll appear soon\n\n> There are 3 different ways that you can make changes to your blog\'s files:\n\n> 1. Edit files within your new username.github.io repository in the browser at GitHub.com (shown below).\n> 2. Use a third party GitHub content editor, like [Prose by Development Seed](http://prose.io). It\'s optimized for use with Jekyll making markdown editing, writing drafts, and uploading images really easy.\n> 3. Clone down your repository and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository.\n\n![_config.yml](/images/config.png "_config.yml")\n\n### Step 3) Publish your first blog post\n\nEdit `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.\n\n![First Post](/images/first-post.png "First Post")\n\n> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post\'s filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md\n\n## Local Development\n\n1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.\n2. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`\n3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`\n4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/\n5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.\n\n## Moar!\n\nI\'ve created a more detailed walkthrough, [**Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages**](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) over at the Smashing Magazine website.

If you\'ve never contributed to an open source project before I\'m more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.\n\nYou can start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/issues/new) describing the problem that you\'re looking to resolve and we\'ll go from there.\n\nI want to keep Jekyll Now as minimal as possible. Every line of code should be one that\'s useful to 90% of the people using it. Please bear that in mind when submitting feature requests. If it\'s not something that most people will use, it probably won\'t get merged. :guardsman:\n'
