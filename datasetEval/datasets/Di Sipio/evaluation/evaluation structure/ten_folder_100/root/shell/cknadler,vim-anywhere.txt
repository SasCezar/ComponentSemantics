b"# vim-anywhere\n\nSometimes, you edit text outside of Vim. These are sad times. Enter\nvim-anywhere!\n\n![demo](assets/demo.gif)\n\nOnce [invoked](#keybinding), vim-anywhere will open a buffer. Close it and its\ncontents are copied to your __clipboard__ and your previous application is\nrefocused.\n\n## Installation\n\n#### Requirements\n\n__OSX:__\n\n- MacVim (`brew cask install macvim`)\n\n__Linux:__\n\n- Gnome (or a derivative)\n- gVim\n\n#### Install\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere/master/install | bash\n```\n\n#### Update\n\n```bash\n~/.vim-anywhere/update\n```\n\n#### Uninstall\n\n```bash\n~/.vim-anywhere/uninstall\n```\n\n## Keybinding\n\n__OSX:__ ( default = `ctrl+cmd+v` )\n\nYou can adjust the shortcut via [system preferences](assets/shortcut.png).\n\n```\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > Vim Anywhere\n```\n\n__Linux:__ ( default = `ctrl+alt+v` )\n\n*Gnome*\n```bash\n$ gconftool -t str --set /desktop/gnome/keybindings/vim-anywhere/binding <custom binding>\n```\n\n*I3WM*\n\n```bash\n$ echo 'bindsym $mod+Alt+v exec ~/.vim-anywhere/bin/run' >> ~/.i3/config # remember to reload your config after\n```\nAdjust in case `$mod` is not set to ctrl.\n\n## History\n\nvim-anywhere creates a temporary file in `/tmp/vim-anywhere` when invoked. These\nfiles stick around until you restart your system, giving you a temporary\nhistory.\n\nView your history:\n\n```bash\n$ ls /tmp/vim-anywhere\n```\n\nReopen your most recent file:\n\n```bash\n$ vim $( ls /tmp/vim-anywhere | sort -r | head -n 1 )\n```\n\n## Why?\n\nI use Vim for _almost_ everything. I wish I didn't have to say _almost_. My\nusual workflow is to open Vim, write, copy the text out of my current buffer\nand paste it into whatever application I was just using. vim-anywhere attempts\nto automate this process as much as possible, reducing the friction of using\nVim to do more than just edit code.\n\n## Bugs\n\nFirst, make sure to [read the FAQ](FAQ.md).
