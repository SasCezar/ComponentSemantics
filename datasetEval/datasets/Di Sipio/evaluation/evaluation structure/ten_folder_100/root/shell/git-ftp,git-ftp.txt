b'Git-ftp -- uploads to FTP servers the Git way\n=============================================\n\nIf you use Git and you need to upload your files to an FTP server,\nGit-ftp can save you some time and bandwidth by uploading only those files that\nchanged since the last upload.\n\nIt keeps track of the uploaded files by storing the commit id\nin a log file on the server. It uses Git to determine which local\nfiles have changed.\n\nYou can easily deploy another branch or go back in the Git history to upload\nan older version.\n\n```sh\n# Setup\ngit config git-ftp.url "ftp://ftp.example.net:21/public_html"\ngit config git-ftp.user "ftp-user"\ngit config git-ftp.password "secr3t"\n\n# Upload all files\ngit ftp init\n\n# Or if the files are already there\ngit ftp catchup\n\n# Work and deploy\necho "new content" >> index.txt\ngit commit index.txt -m "Add new content"\ngit ftp push\n# 1 file to sync:\n# [1 of 1] Buffered for upload \'index.txt\'.\n# Uploading ...\n# Last deployment changed to ded01b27e5c785fb251150805308d3d0f8117387.\n```\n\nIf you encounter any problems, add the `-v` or `-vv` option to see more output.\nThe manual may answer some of your questions as well.\n\nFurther Reading\n---------------\n\n* Read the [manual](man/git-ftp.1.md) for more options, features and examples.\n* See the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md) for your system.\n* Checkout the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).\n* Check [git-ftp issues on GitHub] for open issues.\n* Follow this project on twitter [@gitftp].\n\n* Deploy with [Git-ftp and Bitbucket Pipelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HZhHtZebdw) (video tutorial).\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\n* Windows and OS X: I am very limited in testing on Windows and OS X. Thanks\n  for helping me out fixing bugs on these platforms.\n* git-ftp as deployment tool: git-ftp was not designed as centralized\n  deployment tool. While a commit is being pushed and uploaded to the FTP\n  server, all files belonging to that revision must remain untouched until\n  git-ftp has successfully finished the upload. Otherwise, the contents of the\n  uploaded file will not match the contents of the file referenced in the\n  commit.\n\nContributions\n-------------\n\nDon\'t hesitate to improve this tool.\nDon\'t forget to add yourself to the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file.\nThe core functionality is unit tested using shunit2.\nYou can find the tests in `tests/`.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nThis application is licensed under [GNU General Public License, Version 3.0]\n\n[git-ftp issues on GitHub]: http://github.com/git-ftp/git-ftp/issues\n[GNU General Public License, Version 3.0]:\n http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html\n[@gitftp]: https://twitter.com/gitftp\n'
