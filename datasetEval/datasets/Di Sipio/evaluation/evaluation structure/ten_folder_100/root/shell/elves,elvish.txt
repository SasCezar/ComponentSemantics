Despite its pre-1.0 status, it is\nalready suitable for most daily interactive use.\n\nMost of the resources for Elvish can be found on the [official website](https://elv.sh).\n\nUser groups (all connected thanks to [matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/)):\n[![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-elves/elvish-blue.svg?logo=gitter-white)](https://gitter.im/elves/elvish)\n[![Telegram Group](https://img.shields.io/badge/telegram-@elvish-blue.svg)](https://telegram.me/elvish)\n[![#elvish on freenode](https://img.shields.io/badge/freenode-%23elvish-blue.svg)](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=elvish)\n\n## Building Elvish\n\nTo build Elvish, you need\n\n*   Linux, {Free,Net,Open}BSD, macOS, or Windows (Windows support is experimental).\n\n*   Go >= 1.12.\n\nIf you have not done so, first set up your environment by following [How To Write Go Code](http://golang.org/doc/code.html).\n\nThere are two ways to build Elvish. You can build it directly with `go get`:\n\n```sh\ngo get github.com/elves/elvish\n```\n\nHowever, binaries built in this way lacks some build-time information; for instance, `elvish -version` will show `unknown`. To add such information, use `make`:\n\n```sh\ncd `go env GOPATH`/src/github.com/elves/elvish\nmake get\n```\n\nIn either cases, the binary is placed in `$GOPATH/bin`. Consider adding it to your `$PATH` if you want to run the Elvish binary you just built by just typing `elvish`.\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more notes for contributors.\nYou can also join one of the developer groups (also connected together by\nmatterbridge):\n[![Gitter for Developers](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-elves/elvish--dev-000000.svg?logo=gitter-white)](https://gitter.im/elves/elvish-dev)\n[![Telegram Group for Developers](https://img.shields.io/badge/telegram-@elvish__dev-000000.svg)](https://telegram.me/elvish_dev)\n[![#elvish-dev on freenode](https://img.shields.io/badge/freenode-%23elvish--dev-000000.svg)](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=elvish-dev)\n'
