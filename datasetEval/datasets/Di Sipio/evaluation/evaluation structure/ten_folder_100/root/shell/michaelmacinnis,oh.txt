b'# A surprisingly powerful Unix shell\n\n## Description\n\nOh is a Unix shell. If you\'ve used other Unix shells, oh should feel\nfamiliar.\n\n![gif](img/oh.gif)\n\nWhere oh diverges from traditional Unix shells is in its programming\nlanguage features.\n\nAt its core, oh is a heavily modified dialect of the Scheme programming\nlanguage, complete with first-class continuations and proper tail\nrecursion. Like early Scheme implementations, oh exposes environments\nas first-class values. Oh extends environments to allow both public and\nprivate members and uses these extended first-class environments as the\nbasis for its prototype-based object system.\n\nWritten in Go, oh is also a concurrent programming language. It exposes\nchannels, in addition to pipes, as first-class values. As oh uses the\nsame syntax for code and data, channels and pipes can, in many cases, be\nused interchangeably. This homoiconic nature also allows oh to support\nfexprs which, in turn, allow oh to be easily extended. In fact, much of\noh is written in oh.<sup name="r1">[1](#f1)</sup>\n\nFor a detailed comparison to other Unix shells see: [Comparing oh to other Unix Shells](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmacinnis/oh/master/doc/comparison.html)\n\n## Installing\n\nWith Go 1.5 or greater installed,\n\n    go get github.com/michaelmacinnis/oh\n\nAccording to [gox](https://github.com/mitchellh/gox), oh compiles on the\nfollowing platforms:\n\n    darwin/386\n    darwin/amd64\n    dragonfly/amd64\n    freebsd/386\n    freebsd/amd64\n    freebsd/arm\n    linux/386\n    linux/amd64\n    linux/arm\n    linux/arm64\n    linux/ppc64\n    linux/ppc64le\n    netbsd/386\n    netbsd/amd64\n    netbsd/arm\n    openbsd/386\n    openbsd/amd64\n    plan9/386\n    plan9/amd64\n    solaris/amd64\n    windows/386\n    windows/amd64\n\n(Oh compiles and runs on Plan 9 and Windows but should be considered\nexperimental on those plarforms. On Solaris, interactive features are\nlimited).\n\n## Using\n\nFor more detail see: [Using oh](doc/manual.md)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n<br><a name="f1">1</a>.
