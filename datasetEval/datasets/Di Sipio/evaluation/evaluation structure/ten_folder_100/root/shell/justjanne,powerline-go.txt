b'# A Powerline style prompt for your shell\n\nA [Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) like prompt for Bash,\nZSH and Fish. Based on [Powerline-Shell](https://github.com/banga/powerline-shell) by @banga.\nPorted to golang by @justjanne.\n\n![Solarized+Powerline](https://raw.github.com/justjanne/powerline-go/master/preview.png)\n\n- Shows some important details about the git/hg branch (see below)\n- Changes color if the last command exited with a failure code\n- If you\'re too deep into a directory tree, shortens the displayed path with an ellipsis\n- Shows the current Python [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/) environment\n- Shows if you are in a [nix](https://nixos.org/) shell\n- It\'s easy to customize and extend. See below for details.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n- [Version Control](#version-control)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Precompiled Binaries](#precompiled-binaries)\n  - [Other Platforms](#other-platforms)\n  - [Bash](#bash)\n  - [ZSH](#zsh)\n  - [Fish](#fish)\n  - [Nix](#nix)\n- [Customization](#customization)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Version Control\n\nAll of the version control systems supported by powerline shell give you a\nquick look into the state of your repo:\n\n- The current branch is displayed and changes background color when the\n  branch is dirty.\n- When the local branch differs from the remote, the difference in number\n  of commits is shown along with `\xe2\x87\xa1` or `\xe2\x87\xa3` indicating whether a git push\n  or pull is pending\n\nIn addition, git has a few extra symbols:\n\n- `\xe2\x9c\x8e` -- a file has been modified, but not staged for commit\n- `\xe2\x9c\x94` -- a file is staged for commit\n- `\xe2\x9c\xbc` -- a file has conflicts\n- `+` -- untracked files are present\n- `\xe2\x9a\x91` -- stash is present\n\nEach of these will have a number next to it if more than one file matches.\n\n## Installation\n\n`powerline-go` uses ANSI color codes, these should nowadays work everywhere,\nbut you may have to set your $TERM to `xterm-256color` for it to work.\n\nIf you want to use the "patched" mode (which is the default, and provides\nimproved UI), you\'ll need to install a powerline font, either as fallback,\nor by patching the font you use for your terminal: see\n[powerline-fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts).  \nAlternatively you can use "compatible" or "flat" mode.\n\n### Precompiled Binaries\n\nI provide precompiled binaries for x64 Linux and macOS in the\n[releases tab](https://github.com/justjanne/powerline-go/releases)\n\n### Other Platforms\n\n- Install (and update) the package with\n\n```bash\ngo get -u github.com/justjanne/powerline-go\n```\n\n- By default it will be in `$GOPATH/bin`, if you want to change that, you can set\n  your `$GOPATH` and/or `$GOBIN`, but will need to change the path in the\n  following scripts, too.\n\n### Bash\n\nAdd the following to your `.bashrc` (or `.profile` on Mac):\n\n```bash\nfunction _update_ps1() {\n    PS1="$($GOPATH/bin/powerline-go -error $?)"\n}\n\nif [ "$TERM" != "linux" ] && [ -f "$GOPATH/bin/powerline-go" ]; then\n    PROMPT_COMMAND="_update_ps1; $PROMPT_COMMAND"\nfi\n```\n\nCurrently, right prompt support is not available when using bash.\n\n### ZSH\n\nAdd the following to your `.zshrc`:\n\n```bash\nfunction powerline_precmd() {\n    PS1="$($GOPATH/bin/powerline-go -error $? -shell zsh)"\n}\n\nfunction install_powerline_precmd() {\n  for s in "${precmd_functions[@]}"; do\n    if [ "$s" = "powerline_precmd" ]; then\n      return\n    fi\n  done\n  precmd_functions+=(powerline_precmd)\n}\n\nif [ "$TERM" != "linux" ]; then\n    install_powerline_precmd\nfi\n```\n\n### Fish\n\nRedefine `fish_prompt` in `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:\n\n```bash\nfunction fish_prompt\n    $GOPATH/bin/powerline-go -error $status -shell bare\nend\n```\n### Nix\n\nWhen using `nix-shell --pure`, `powerline-go` will not be accessible, and\nyour prompt will disappear.\n\nTo work around this you can add this snippet to your `.bashrc`,\nwhich should re-enable the prompt in most cases:\n\n```bash\n# Workaround for nix-shell --pure\nif [ "$IN_NIX_SHELL" == "pure" ]; then\n    if [ -x "$HOME/.nix-profile/bin/powerline-go" ]; then\n        alias powerline-go="$HOME/.nix-profile/bin/powerline-go"\n    elif [ -x "/run/current-system/sw/bin/powerline-go" ]; then\n        alias powerline-go="/run/current-system/sw/bin/powerline-go"\n    fi\nfi\n```\n\n## Customization\n\nThere are a few optional arguments which can be seen by running\n`powerline-go -help`. These can be used by changing the command you have set\nin your shell\xe2\x80\x99s init file.\n\n```\nUsage of powerline-go:\n  -colorize-hostname\n    \t Colorize the hostname based on a hash of itself\n  -condensed\n    \t Remove spacing between segments\n  -cwd-max-depth int\n    \t Maximum number of directories to show in path\n    \t (default 5)\n  -cwd-max-dir-size int\n    \t Maximum number of letters displayed for each directory in the path\n    \t (default -1)\n  -cwd-mode string\n    \t How to display the current directory\n    \t (valid choices: fancy, plain, dironly)\n    \t (default "fancy")\n  -duration string\n    \t The elapsed clock-time of the previous command\n  -east-asian-width\n    \t Use East Asian Ambiguous Widths\n  -error int\n    \t Exit code of previously executed command\n  -eval\n    \t Output prompt in \'eval\' format.\n  -ignore-repos string\n    \t A list of git repos to ignore.

This is useful if\nyou\'re often in deep path hierarchies that end up consuming most of your\nterminal width, even when some portions are replaced by an ellipsis.\n\nFor example, you might want to replace the string `$GOPATH/src/github.com` with\n`@GOPATH-GH`. When you\'re in a directory like\n`$GOPATH/src/github.com/justjanne/powerline-go`, you\'ll instead see `@GOPATH-GH >\njustjanne > powerline-go` in the shell prompt.\n\nAliases are defined as comma-separated key value pairs, like this:\n\n```bash\npowerline-go ... -path-aliases \\$GOPATH/src/github.com=@GOPATH-GH,\\~/work/projects/foo=@FOO,\\~/work/projects/bar=@BAR\n```\n    \nNote that you should use `~` instead of `/home/username` when specifying the\npath. Also make sure to escape the `~` character. Otherwise your shell will\nperform interpolation on it before `powerline-go` can see it!\n\n### Duration\n\nThe duration segment requires some assistance from the shell.  The shell must have a hook that gets executed immediately before the command.\n\n#### Bash\n\nBash 4.4 includes an easy way to get a start-time, using `$PS0`.  However, not all operating systems come with a sufficiently recent version of Bash installed.  This example only has seconds precision.  Add or modify your `.bashrc` file to include the following:\n\n```bash\nINTERACTIVE_BASHPID_TIMER="/tmp/${USER}.START.$$"\n\nPS0=\'$(echo $SECONDS > "$INTERACTIVE_BASHPID_TIMER")\'\n\nfunction _update_ps1() {\n  local __ERRCODE=$?\n\n  local __DURATION=0\n  if [ -e $INTERACTIVE_BASHPID_TIMER ]; then\n    local __END=$SECONDS\n    local __START=$(cat "$INTERACTIVE_BASHPID_TIMER")\n    __DURATION="$(($__END - ${__START:-__END}))"\n    rm -f "$INTERACTIVE_BASHPID_TIMER"\n  fi\n\n  PS1="$($GOPATH/bin/powerline-go -modules duration -duration $__DURATION -error $__ERRCODE -shell bash)"\n}\n\nif [ "$TERM" != "linux" ] && [ -f "$GOPATH/bin/powerline-go" ]; then\n  PROMPT_COMMAND="_update_ps1; $PROMPT_COMMAND"\nfi\n```\n\n#### Zsh\n\nUsing `$EPOCHREALTIME` requires loading the \'datetime\' module in your `.zshrc` file, for example:\n\n```bash\nzmodload zsh/datetime\n\nfunction preexec() {\n  __TIMER=$EPOCHREALTIME\n}\n\nfunction powerline_precmd() {\n  local __ERRCODE=$?\n  local __DURATION=0\n\n  if [ -n $__TIMER ]; then\n    local __ERT=$EPOCHREALTIME\n    __DURATION="$(($__ERT - ${__TIMER:-__ERT}))"\n  fi\n\n  PS1="$(powerline-go -modules duration -duration $__DURATION -error $__ERRCODE -shell zsh)"\n  unset __TIMER\n}\n```\n\nIf the \'datetime\' module is unavailable or unwanted, you may replace `$EPOCHREALTIME` with `$SECONDS`, at the loss of precision.\n\n#### Fish\n\nThe fish prompt, in `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, will require a minimum of changes, as Fish automatically provides `$CMD_DURATION`, although with only milliseconds accuracy.\n\n```bash\nfunction fish_prompt\n    set duration (math -s6 "$CMD_DURATION / 1000")\n    $GOPATH/bin/powerline-go -modules duration -duration $duration -error $status -shell bare\nend\n```\n\n## License\n\n> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  \n> This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
