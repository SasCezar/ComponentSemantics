The beauty of it too is that it has the Arch User Repository (AUR), which when combined with its official binary repositories allows it to probably have the largest repositories of any distribution. Its packaging process is also very simple, which means if one wants a package not in its official repositories or the AUR, it should be easy to make it for oneself.\n- **Linux Mint**, which is also built from Ubuntu LTS releases, but features editions featuring a few different desktop environments, including Cinnamon, MATE and Xfce. Mint is quite polished and its aesthetics are rather appealing, I especially like its new icon theme, although I do quite dislike its GTK+ theme (too bland to my taste). I\xe2\x80\x99ve also found a bug in its latest release Mint 19, that is getting quite irritating as I asked for with it over a fortnight ago on their forums and I have received no replies so far and it is a bug that makes my life on it more difficult.\n- **Kali Linux**, is a Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing. Kali contains several hundred tools which are geared towards various information security tasks, such as Penetration Testing, Security research, Computer Forensics and Reverse Engineering.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [List of Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions)\n- [What is your favorite Linux distro and why?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-favorite-Linux-distro-and-why)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What are the differences between Unix, Linux, BSD, and GNU?</b></summary><br>\n\n**GNU** isn\'t really an OS. It\'s more of a set of rules or philosophies that govern free software, that at the same time gave birth to a bunch of tools while trying to create an OS. So **GNU** tools are basically open versions of tools that already existed, but were reimplemented to conform to principals of open software. **GNU/Linux** is a mesh of those tools and the **Linux kernel** to form a complete OS, but there are other GNUs, e.g. **GNU/Hurd**.\n\n**Unix** and **BSD** are "older" implementations of POSIX that are various levels of "closed source". **Unix** is usually totally closed source, but there are as many flavors of **Unix** as there are **Linux** (if not more). **BSD** is not usually considered "open", but it was considered to be very open when it was released. Its licensing also allowed for commercial use with far fewer restrictions than the more "open" licenses of the time allowed.\n\n**Linux** is the newest of the four. Strictly speaking, it\'s "just a kernel"; however, in general, it\'s thought of as a full OS when combined with GNU Tools and several other core components.\n\nThe main governing differences between these are their ideals. **Unix**, **Linux**, and **BSD** have different ideals that they implement. They are all POSIX, and are all basically interchangeable. They do solve some of the same problems in different ways. So other then ideals and how they choose to implement POSIX standards, there is little difference.\n\nFor more info I suggest your read a brief article on the creation of **GNU**, **OSS**, **Linux**, **BSD**, and **UNIX**. They will be slanted towards their individual ideas, but those articles should give you a better idea of the differences.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [What is the difference between Unix, Linux, BSD and GNU?

Tell me about your favorite CLI tools, tips, and hacks.</b></summary><br>\n\n**CLI** is an acronym for Command Line Interface or Command Language Interpreter. The command line is one of the most powerful ways to control your system/computer.\n\nIn Unix like systems, **CLI** is the interface by which a user can type commands for the system to execute. The **CLI** is very powerful, but is not very error-tolerant.\n\nThe **CLI** allows you to do manipulations with your system\xe2\x80\x99s internals and with code in a much more fine-tuned way. It offers greater flexibility and control than a GUI regardless of what OS is used. Many programs that you might want to use in your software that are hosted on say Github also require running some commands on the **CLI** in order to get them running.\n\n**My favorite tools**\n\n- `screen` - free terminal multiplexer, I can start a session and My terminals will be saved even when you connection is lost, so you can resume later or from home\n- `ssh` - the most valuable over-all command to learn, I can use it to do some amazing things:\n  * mount a file system over the internet with `sshfs`\n  * forward commands: runs against a `rsync` server with no `rsync` deamon by starting one itself via ssh\n  * run in batch files: I can redirect the output from the remote command and use it within local batch file\n- `vi/vim` - is the most popular and powerful text editor, it\'s universal, it\'s work very fast, even on large files\n- `bash-completion` - contains a number of predefined completion rules for shell\n\n**Tips & Hacks**\n\n- searches the command history with `CTRL + R`\n- `popd/pushd` and other shell builtins which allow you manipulate the directory stack\n- editing keyboard shortcuts like a `CTRL + U`, `CTRL + E`\n- combinations will be auto-expanded:\n  * `!*` - all arguments of last command\n  * `!!` - the whole of last command\n  * `!ssh` - last command starting with ssh\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Command Line Interface Definition](http://www.linfo.org/command_line_interface.html)\n- [What is your single most favorite command-line trick using Bash?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68372/what-is-your-single-most-favorite-command-line-trick-using-bash/69716)\n- [What are your favorite command line features or tricks?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/6/what-are-your-favorite-command-line-features-or-tricks)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What is your favorite shell and why?</b></summary><br>\n\n**BASH** is my favorite. It\xe2\x80\x99s really a preferential kind of thing, where I love the syntax and it just "clicks" for me. The input/output redirection syntax (`>>`, `<< 2>&1`, `2>`, `1>`, etc) is similar to C++ which makes it easier for me to recognize.\n\nI also like the **ZSH** shell, because is much more customizable than **BASH**. It has the Oh-My-Zsh framework, powerful context based tab completion, pattern matching/globbing on steroids, loadable modules and more.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Comparison of command shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_command_shells)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>How do you get help on the command line? ***</b></summary><br>\n\n- `man` [commandname] can be used to see a description of a command (ex.: `man less`, `man cat`)\n\n- `-h` or `--help` some programs will implement printing instructions when passed this parameter (ex.: `python -h` and `python --help`)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Your first 5 commands on a *nix server after login.</b></summary><br>\n\n- `w` - a lot of great information in there with the server uptime\n- `top` - you can see all running processes, then order them by CPU, memory utilization and more\n- `netstat` - to know on what port and IP your server is listening on and what processes are using those\n- `df` - reports the amount of available disk space being used by file systems\n- `history` - tell you what was previously run by the user you are currently connected to\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [First 5 Commands When I Connect on a Linux Server (original)](https://www.linux.com/blog/first-5-commands-when-i-connect-linux-server)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What do the fields in <code>ls -al</code> output mean?</b></summary><br>\n\nIn the order of output:\n\n```bash\n-rwxrw-r--    1    root   root 2048    Jan 13 07:11 db.dump\n```\n\n- file permissions,\n- number of links,\n- owner name,\n- owner group,\n- file size,\n- time of last modification,\n- file/directory name\n\nFile permissions is displayed as following:\n\n- first character is `-` or `l` or `d`, `d` indicates a directory, a `-` represents a file, `l` is a symlink (or soft link) - special type of file\n- three sets of characters, three times, indicating permissions for owner, group and other:\n  - `r` = readable\n  - `w` = writable\n  - `x` = executable\n\nIn your example `-rwxrw-r--`, this means the line displayed is:\n\n- a regular file (displayed as `-`)\n- readable, writable and executable by owner (`rwx`)\n- readable, writable, but not executable by group (`rw-`)\n- readable but not writable or executable by other (`r--`)\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [What do the fields in ls -al output mean?

How can you do that?</b></summary><br>\n\nThe most significant advantage of executing the running process in the background is that you can do any other task simultaneously while other processes are running in the background. So, more processes can be completed in the background while you are working on different processes. It can be achieved by adding a special character `&` at the end of the command.\n\nGenerally applications that take too long to execute and doesn\'t require user interaction are sent to background so that we can continue our work in terminal.\n\nFor example if you want to download something in background, you can:\n\n```bash\nwget https://url-to-download.com/download.tar.gz &\n```\n\nWhen you run the above command you get the following output:\n\n```bash\n[1] 2203\n```\n\nHere 1 is the serial number of job and 2203 is PID of the job.\n\nYou can see the jobs running in background using the following command:\n\n```bash\njobs\n```\n\nWhen you execute job in background it give you a PID of job, you can kill the job running in background using the following command:\n\n```bash\nkill PID\n```\n\nReplace the PID with the PID of the job. If you have only one job running you can bring it to foreground using:\n\n```bash\nfg\n```\n\nIf you have multiple jobs running in background you can bring any job in foreground using:\n\n```bash\nfg %#\n```\n\nReplace the `#` with serial number of the job.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [How do I run a Unix process in the background?](https://kb.iu.edu/d/afnz)\n- [Job Control Commands](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/x9644.html)\n- [What is/are the advantage(s) of running applications in background?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/162186/what-is-are-the-advantages-of-running-applications-in-backgound)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Before you can manage processes, you must be able to identify them.

It is a good or bad practices?</b></summary><br>\n\nRunning (everything) as root is bad because:\n\n- **Stupidity**: nothing prevents you from making a careless mistake. If you try to change the system in any potentially harmful way, you need to use sudo, which ensures a pause (while you\'re entering the password) to ensure that you aren\'t about to make a mistake.\n\n- **Security**: harder to hack if you don\'t know the admin user\'s login account. root means you already have one half of the working set of admin credentials.\n\n- **You don\'t really need it**: if you need to run several commands as root, and you\'re annoyed by having to enter your password several times when `sudo` has expired, all you need to do is `sudo -i` and you are now root. Want to run some commands using pipes? Then use `sudo sh -c "command1 | command2"`.\n\n- **You can always use it in the recovery console**: the recovery console allows you to recover from a major mistake, or fix a problem caused by an app (which you still had to run as `sudo`). Ubuntu doesn\'t have a password for the root account in this case, but you can search online for changing that - this will make it harder for anyone that has physical access to your box to be able to do harm.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Why is it bad to log in as root?

This measures demand, which can be greater than what the system is currently processing. Most tools show three averages, for 1, 5, and 15 minutes.\n\nThese 3 numbers are not the numbers for the different CPUs. These numbers are mean values of the load number for a given period of time (of the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes).\n\n**Load average** is usually described as "average length of run queue". So few CPU-consuming processes or threads can raise **load average** above 1. There is no problem if **load average** is less than total number of CPU cores. But if it gets higher than number of CPUs, this means some threads/processes will stay in queue, ready to run, but waiting for free CPU.\n\nIt is meant to give you an idea of the state of the system, averaged over several periods of time. Since it is averaged, it takes time for it to go back to 0 after a heavy load was placed on the system.\n\nSome interpretations:\n\n- if the averages are 0.0, then your system is idle\n- if the 1 minute average is higher than the 5 or 15 minute averages, then load is increasing\n- if the 1 minute average is lower than the 5 or 15 minute averages, then load is decreasing\n- if they are higher than your CPU count, then you might have a performance problem (it depends)\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Linux Load Averages: Solving the Mystery (original)](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-08-08/linux-load-averages.html)\n- [Linux load average - the definitive summary](http://blog.angulosolido.pt/2015/04/linux-load-average-definitive-summary.html)\n- [How CPU load averages work (and using them to triage webserver performance!)](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/02/07/cpu-load-averages/)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Where is my password stored on Linux/Unix?</b></summary><br>\n\nThe passwords are not stored anywhere on the system at all. What is stored in `/etc/shadow` are so called hashes of the passwords.\n\nA hash of some text is created by performing a so called one way function on the text (password), thus creating a string to check against. By design it is "impossible" (computationally infeasible) to reverse that process.\n\nOlder Unix variants stored the encrypted passwords in `/etc/passwd` along with other information about each account.\n\nNewer ones simply have a `*` in the relevant field in `/etc/passwd` and use `/etc/shadow` to store the password, in part to ensure nobody gets read access to the passwords when they only need the other stuff (`shadow` is usually protected more strongly than `passwd`).\n\nFor more info consult `man crypt`, `man shadow`, `man passwd`.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Where is my password stored on Linux?](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/37050/where-is-my-password-stored-on-linux)\n- [Where are the passwords of the users located in Linux?](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/where-are-the-passwords-of-the-users-located-in-linux/)\n- [Linux Password & Shadow File Formats](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/lame/LAME/linux-admin-made-easy/shadow-file-formats.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>How to recursively change permissions for all directories except files and for all files except directories?</b></summary><br>\n\nTo change all the directories e.g. to **755** (`drwxr-xr-x`):\n\n```bash\nfind /opt/data -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\n```\n\nTo change all the files e.g. to **644** (`-rw-r--r--`):\n\n```bash\nfind /opt/data -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\n```\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [How do I set chmod for a folder and all of its subfolders and files?

Explain.</b></summary><br>\n\n- **SIGHUP** - is sent to a process when its controlling terminal is closed. It was originally designed to notify the process of a serial line drop (a hangup). Many daemons will reload their configuration files and reopen their logfiles instead of exiting when receiving this signal.\n- **SIGINT** - is sent to a process by its controlling terminal when a user wishes to interrupt the process. This is typically initiated by pressing `Ctrl+C`, but on some systems, the "delete" character or "break" key can be used.\n- **SIGKILL** - is sent to a process to cause it to terminate immediately (kill).

There are no safeguards against failure\n- **RAID1**: A popular disk subsystem that increases safety by writing the same data on two drives. Called "**mirroring**," RAID 1 does not increase write performance, but read performance may equal up to the sum of each disks\' performance. However, if one drive fails, the second drive is used, and the failed drive is manually replaced. After replacement, the RAID controller duplicates the contents of the working drive onto the new one\n- **RAID5**: It is disk subsystem that increases safety by computing parity data and increasing speed by interleaving data across three or more drives (**striping**). Upon failure of a single drive, subsequent reads can be calculated from the distributed parity such that no data is lost\n- **RAID6**: RAID 6 extends RAID 5 by adding another parity block. It requires a minimum of four disks and can continue to execute read and write of any two concurrent disk failures. RAID 6 does not have a performance penalty for read operations, but it does have a performance penalty on write operations because of the overhead associated with parity calculations\n- **RAID10**: Also known as **RAID 1+0**, is a RAID configuration that combines disk mirroring and disk striping to protect data. It requires a minimum of four disks, and stripes data across mirrored pairs. As long as one disk in each mirrored pair is functional, data can be retrieved. If two disks in the same mirrored pair fail, all data will be lost because there is no parity in the striped sets\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [RAID](https://www.prepressure.com/library/technology/raid)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>How is a user\xe2\x80\x99s default group determined?

Do you need a VLAN to setup a subnet?</b></summary><br>\n\n**VLANs** and **subnets** solve different problems. **VLANs** work at Layer 2, thereby altering broadcast domains (for instance). Whereas **subnets** are Layer 3 in the current context.\n\n**Subnet** - is a range of IP addresses determined by part of an address (often called the network address) and a subnet mask (netmask). For example, if the netmask is `255.255.255.0` (or `/24` for short), and the network address is `192.168.10.0`, then that defines a range of IP addresses `192.168.10.0` through `192.168.10.255`. Shorthand for writing that is `192.168.10.0/24`.\n\n**VLAN** - a good way to think of this is "switch partitioning." Let\'s say you have an 8 port switch that is VLAN-able. You can assign 4 ports to one **VLAN** (say `VLAN 1`) and 4 ports to another **VLAN** (say `VLAN 2`). `VLAN 1` won\'t see any of `VLAN 2\'s` traffic and vice versa, logically, you now have two separate switches. Normally on a switch, if the switch hasn\'t seen a MAC address it will "flood" the traffic to all other ports. **VLANs** prevent this.\n\nSubnet is nothing more than an IP address range of IP addresses that help hosts communicate over layer 2 and 3. Each subnet does not require its own **VLAN**. **VLANs** are implemented for isolation (are sandbox for layer two communication, no 2 systems of 2 different **VLANs** may communicate but it can be done through **Inter VLAN routing**), ease of management and security.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [What is the difference between a VLAN and a subnet?

By default this will send messages to the POP mail client and remove them from the mail server, though it is possible to configure the mail server to retain all messages. Any actions you take on the message in your mail client (labeling, deleting, moving to a folder) will not be reflected on the mail server, and thus inaccessible to other mail clients pulling from the mail server. POP uses little storage space on the mail server and can be seen as more secure since messages only exist on one mail client instead of the mail server and multiple clients.\n\n**IMAP** (_Internet Message Access Protocol_) uses two way communication between mail server and client. Deleting or labeling a message in your mail client configured with IMAP will also delete or label the message on the mail server. IMAP allows for a similar experience when accessing mail across different clients or devices since messages can existing in the same state across multiple devices. IMAP can also save disk space on the mail client by selectively syncing messages, deleting older messages from the mail client since it can sync them from the mail server later as needed.\n\nChoose IMAP if you need to access messages across multiple devices and you want to save disk space on your client device. Choose POP if you want to save disk space on your mail server, only access messages from one client device, and ensure that messages do not exist on multiple systems.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>How to check default route and routing table?</b></summary><br>\n\nUsing the commands `netstat -nr`, `route -n` or `ip route show` we can see the default route and routing tables.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [How to check routes (routing table) in linux](https://howto.lintel.in/how-to-check-routes-routing-table-in-linux/)\n- [FreeBSD Set a Default Route/Gateway](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/freebsd-setup-default-routing-with-route-command/)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What is the difference between 127.0.0.1 and localhost?</b></summary><br>\n\nWell, the most likely difference is that you still have to do an actual lookup of localhost somewhere.\n\nIf you use `127.0.0.1`, then (intelligent) software will just turn that directly into an IP address and use it. Some implementations of `gethostbyname` will detect the dotted format (and presumably the equivalent IPv6 format) and not do a lookup at all.\n\nOtherwise, the name has to be resolved. And there\'s no guarantee that your hosts file will actually be used for that resolution (first, or at all) so `localhost` may become a totally different IP address.\n\nBy that I mean that, on some systems, a local hosts file can be bypassed. The `host.conf` file controls this on Linux (and many other Unices).\n\nIf you use a Unix domain socket it\'ll be slightly faster than using TCP/IP (because of the less overhead you have). Windows is using TCP/IP as a default, whereas Linux tries to use a Unix Domain Socket if you choose localhost and TCP/IP if you take `127.0.0.1`.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [What is the difference between 127.0.0.1 and localhost?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7382602/what-is-the-difference-between-127-0-0-1-and-localhost)\n- [localhost vs. 127.0.0.1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3715925/localhost-vs-127-0-0-1)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Which port is used for <code>ping</code> command?</b></summary><br>\n\n`ping` uses **ICMP**, specifically **ICMP echo request** and **ICMP echo reply** packets. There is no \'port\' associated with **ICMP**. Ports are associated with the two IP transport layer protocols, TCP and UDP. **ICMP**, TCP, and UDP are "siblings"; they are not based on each other, but are three separate protocols that run on top of IP.\n\n**ICMP** packets are identified by the \'protocol\' field in the IP datagram header. **ICMP** does not use either UDP or TCP communications services, it uses raw IP communications services. This means that the **ICMP** message is carried directly in an IP datagram data field. `raw` comes from how this is implemented in software, to create and send an **ICMP** message, one opens a `raw` socket, builds a buffer containing the **ICMP** message, and then writes the buffer containing the message to the raw socket.\n\nThe IP protocol value for **ICMP** is 1. The protocol field is part of the IP header and identifies what is in the data portion of the IP datagram.\n\nHowever, you could use `nmap` to see whether ports are open or not:\n\n```bash\nnmap -p 80 example.com\n```\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Ping Port Number](https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/42463/ping-port-number)\n- [Is it possible to ping an address:port?](https://superuser.com/questions/769541/is-it-possible-to-ping-an-addressport)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Server A can\'t talk to Server B.

A packet filtering device is a very appropriate measure for providing isolation of one subnet from another.\n\nOperating at the network layer and transport layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack, every packet is examined as it enters the protocol stack. The network and transport headers are examined closely for the following information:\n\n- **protocol (IP header, network layer)** - in the IP header, byte 9 (remember the byte count begins with zero) identifies the protocol of the packet. Most filter devices have the capability to differentiate between TCP, UPD, and ICMP.\n- **source address (IP header, network layer)** - the source address is the 32-bit IP address of the host which created the packet.\n- **destination address (IP header, network layer)** - the destination address is the 32-bit IP address of the host the packet is destined for.\n- **source port (TCP or UDP header, transport layer)** - each end of a TCP or UDP network connection is bound to a port. TCP ports are separate and distinct from UDP ports. Ports numbered below 1024 are reserved \xe2\x80\x93 they have a specifically defined use. Ports numbered above 1024 (inclusive) are known as ephemeral ports. They can be used however a vendor chooses. For a list of "well known" ports, refer to RFP1700. The source port is a pseudo-randomly assigned ephemeral port number. Thus it is often not very useful to filter on the source port.\n- **destination port (TCP or UDP header, transport layer)** - the destination port number indicates a port that the packet is sent to. Each service on the destination host listens to a port. Some well-known ports that might be filtered are 20/TCP and 21/TCP - ftp connection/data, 23/TCP - telnet, 80/TCP - http, and 53/TCP - DNS zone transfers.\n- **connection status (TCP header, transport layer)** - the connection status tells whether the packet is the first packet of the network session. The ACK bit in the TCP header is set to \xe2\x80\x9cfalse\xe2\x80\x9d or 0 if this is the first packet in the session. It is simple to disallow a host from establishing a connection by rejecting or discarding any packets which have the ACK bit set to "false" or 0.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Building Internet Firewalls - Packet Filtering](http://web.deu.edu.tr/static/oreily/networking/firewall/ch06_01.htm)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What are the advantages of using a reverse proxy server?</b></summary><br>\n\n**Hide the topology and characteristics of your back-end servers**\n\nThe **reverse proxy server** can hide the presence and characteristics of the origin server. It acts as an intermediate between internet cloud and web server. It is good for security reason especially when you are using web hosting services.\n\n**Allows transparent maintenance of backend servers**\n\nChanges you make to servers running behind a reverse proxy are going to be completely transparent to your end users.\n\n**Load Balancing**\n\nThe reverse proxy will then enforce a load balancing algorithm like round robin, weighted round robin, least connections, weighted least connections, or random, to distribute the load among the servers in the cluster.\n\nWhen a server goes down, the system will automatically failover to the next server up and users can continue with their secure file transfer activities.\n\n**SSL offloading/termination**\n\nHandles incoming HTTPS connections, decrypting the requests and passing unencrypted requests on to the web servers.\n\n**IP masking**\n\nUsing a single ip but different URLs to route to different back end servers.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [The Benefits of a Reverse Proxy](https://dzone.com/articles/benefits-reverse-proxy)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What is the difference between a router and a gateway?

You could also state that "_you set up a router as gateway_". Another term is hop which describes the forwarding in between subnets.\n\nThe term **default gateway** is used to mean the router on your LAN which has the responsibility of being the first point of contact for traffic to computers outside the LAN.\n\nIt\'s just a matter of perspective, the device is the same.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Difference between router and gateway (orignal)](https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/51426/difference-between-router-and-gateway)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Explain the function of each of the following DNS records: SOA, PTR, A, MX, and CNAME.</b></summary><br>\n\n**DNS records** are basically mapping files that tell the DNS server which IP address each domain is associated with, and how to handle requests sent to each domain.

Your network card (what is addressed by the mac address - physical address) needs to only be responsible for communicating with peers on it\'s physical network.\n\nThe communication that you are allowed to accomplish with your **MAC** address is going to be limited to other devices that reside within physical contact to your machine. On the internet, for example, you are not physically connected to each machine. That\'s why we make use of **TCP/IP** (a **layer 3**, logical address) mechanism when we need to communicate with a machine that we are not physically connected to.\n\n**IP** is an arbitrary numbering scheme imposed in a hierarchical fashion on a group of computers to logically distinguish them as a group (that\'s what a subnet is). Sending messages between those groups is done by routing tables, themselves divided into multiple levels so that we don\'t have to keep track of every single subnet.\n\nIt\'s also pretty easy to relate this to another pair of systems. You have a State Issued ID Number, why would you need a mailing address if that ID number is already unique to just you? You need the mailing address because it\'s an arbitrary system that describes where the unique destination for communications to you should go.\n\nOn the other hand, the distribution of **MAC** addresses across the network is random and completely unrelated to topology. Routes grouping would be impossible, every router would need to keep track of routes for every single device that relays traffic trough it. That is what **layer 2** switches do, and that does not scale well beyond a certain number of hosts.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Why couldn\'t MAC addresses be used instead of IPv4|6 for networking?

In UEFI systems, a payload, such as the Linux kernel, can be executed directly. Thus no boot loader is necessary. Some popular bootloaders: **GRUB**, **Syslinux/Isolinux** or **Lilo**.\n\n**Kernel**: The kernel in Linux handles all operating system processes, such as memory management, task scheduling, I/O, interprocess communication, and overall system control. This is loaded in two stages - in the first stage, the kernel (as a compressed image file) is loaded into memory and decompressed, and a few fundamental functions such as basic memory management are set up.\n\n**Init**: Is the parent of all processes on the system, it is executed by the kernel and is responsible for starting all other processes.\n\n- `SysV init` - init\'s job is "to get everything running the way it should be once the kernel is fully running. Essentially it establishes and operates the entire user space. This includes checking and mounting file systems, starting up necessary user services, and ultimately switching to a user-environment when system startup is completed.\n- `systemd` - the developers of systemd aimed to replace the Linux init system inherited from Unix System V. Like init, systemd is a daemon that manages other daemons. All daemons, including systemd, are background processes. Systemd is the first daemon to start (during booting) and the last daemon to terminate (during shutdown).\n- `runinit` - runinit is an init scheme for Unix-like operating systems that initializes, supervises, and ends processes throughout the operating system. It is a reimplementation of the daemontools process supervision toolkit that runs on the Linux, Mac OS X, \\*BSD, and Solaris operating systems.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Analyzing the Linux boot process](https://opensource.com/article/18/1/analyzing-linux-boot-process)\n- [Systemd Boot Process a Close Look in Linux](https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/systemd-boot-process/)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>How and why Linux daemons drop privileges?

If your load average stays above 1.00, find the problem and fix it now. Otherwise, you\'re going to get woken up in the middle of the night, and it\'s not going to be fun.\n\nRule of Thumb: 5.0.

What is the best way to go about upgrading all of these to the latest?</b></summary><br>\n\nBy using **Infrastructure as a Code** approach, there are multiple good ways:\n\n1. **Configuration Synchronization Change Management Model**:\n\nThere are Configuration Management Tools (Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Saltstack, ...), that can be used to automatically update `ntpd` service on all servers. To keep systems stable, system packages on servers are usually auto-updated with only security updates. Major or minor versions of packages are usually version locked in configuration definitions to prevent misconfiguration of the service. Change is then deployed by changing `ntpd` version in configuration definition.\n\nWith this approach, it is important to be careful when deploying changes into infrastructure massively. The pipeline of deployment should include Unit, Integration and System tests, and eventually be first deployed into Staging environment to prove configuration. If tests prove configuration correctness, deployment should be done by incremental rollout with ability to rollback in case of errors or failure.\n\n2. **Immutable Servers Model**:\n\nIn Immutable Server model, whole unit (server, container) is replaced by new updated image rather than making changes to running server (this eliminates configuration drift). With this approach you usually build server image with tools like Packer or Docker with Dockerfile. This image is then tested and deployed similarly as in option above (1.), but now using techniques such as Canary Release, which also has ability to incremental rollout and rollback.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Infrastructure as a Code - Chapter 8: Patterns for Updating and Changing Servers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039297.do)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>How to permanently set <code>$PATH</code> on Linux/Unix?

How to examine boot messages and where are they stored?</b></summary><br>\n\nYour console has two types of messages:\n\n- **generated by the kernel** (via printk)\n- **generated by userspace** (usually your init system)\n\nKernel messages are always stored in the **kmsg** buffer, visible via `dmesg` command. They\'re also often copied to your **syslog**. This also applies to userspace messages written to `/dev/kmsg`, but those are fairly rare.\n\nMeanwhile, when userspace writes its fancy boot status text to `/dev/console` or `/dev/tty1`, it\'s not stored anywhere at all. It just goes to the screen and that\'s it.\n\n`dmesg` is used to review boot messages contained in the kernel ring buffer. A ring buffer is a buffer of fixed size for which any new data added to it overwrites the oldest data in it.\n\nIt shows operations once the boot process has completed, such as command line options passed to the kernel; hardware components detected, events when a new USB device is added, or errors like NIC (Network Interface Card) failure and the drivers report no link activity detected on the network and so much more.\n\nIf system logging is done via the journal component you should use `journalctl`. It shows messages include kernel and boot messages; messages from syslog or various services.\n\nBoot issues/errors calls for a system administrator to look into certain important files in conjunction with particular commands (handled differently by different versions of Linux):\n\n- `/var/log/boot.log` - system boot log, it contains all that unfolded during the system boot\n- `/var/log/messages` - stores global system messages, including the messages that are logged during system boot\n- `/var/log/dmesg` - contains kernel ring buffer information\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [How to view all boot messages in Linux after booting?

What are the reasons for this and how to resolve swapping problems?</b></summary><br>\n\n**Swap** space is a restricted amount of physical memory that is allocated for use by the operating system when available memory has been fully utilized. It is memory management that involves swapping sections of memory to and from physical storage.\n\nIf the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM. **Swap** space is located on hard drives, which have a slower access time than physical memory.\n\nWorkload increases your RAM demand. You are running a workload that requires more memory. Usage of the entire swap indicates that. Also, changing `swappiness` to **1** might not be a wise decision. Setting `swappiness` to **1** does not indicate that swapping will not be done. It just indicates how aggressive kernel will be in respect of swapping, it does not eliminate swapping. Swapping will happen if needs to be done.\n\n- **Increasing the size of the swap space** - firstly, you\'d have increased disk use. If your disks aren\'t fast enough to keep up, then your system might end up thrashing, and you\'d experience slowdowns as data is swapped in and out of memory. This would result in a bottleneck.\n\n- **Adding more RAM** - the real solution is to add more memory. There\'s no substitute for RAM, and if you have enough memory, you\'ll swap less.\n\nFor monitoring swap space usage:\n\n- `cat /proc/swaps` - to see total and used swap size\n- `grep SwapTotal /proc/meminfo` - to show total swap space\n- `free` - to display the amount of free and used system memory (also swap)\n- `vmstat` - to check swapping statistics\n- `top`, `htop`- to check swap space usage\n- `atop` - to show is that your system is overcommitting memory\n- or use one-liner shell command to list all applications with how much swap space search is using in kilobytes:\n```bash\nfor _fd in /proc/*/status ; do\n  awk \'/VmSwap|Name/{printf $2 " " $3}END{ print ""}\' $_fd\ndone | sort -k 2 -n -r | less\n```\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Linux ate my ram!](https://www.linuxatemyram.com/)\n- [How to find out which processes are using swap space in Linux?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/479953/how-to-find-out-which-processes-are-using-swap-space-in-linux)\n- [8 Useful Commands to Monitor Swap Space Usage in Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/commands-to-monitor-swap-space-usage-in-linux/)\n- [What is the danger in having a fully used SWAP in an Ubuntu server?](https://serverfault.com/questions/499301/what-is-the-danger-in-having-a-fully-used-swap-in-an-ubuntu-server)\n- [How to empty swap if there is free RAM?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1357/how-to-empty-swap-if-there-is-free-ram)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What is umask?

The inode is only deleted (or deletable/over-writable) when all links to the inode have been deleted.\n\n- a symbolic link is a link to another name in the file system\n\nOnce a hard link has been made the link is to the inode. deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link as it links to the underlying inode. Any changes to the data on the inode is reflected in all files that refer to that inode.\n\nNote: Hard links are only valid within the same file system. Symbolic links can span file systems as they are simply the name of another file.\n\nDifferences:\n\n- **Hardlink** cannot be created for directories. Hard link can only be created for a file\n- **Softlink** also termed a symbolic links or symlinks can link to a directory\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [What is the difference between a hard link and a symbolic link?](https://medium.com/@wendymayorgasegura/what-is-the-difference-between-a-hard-link-and-a-symbolic-link-8c0493041b62)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>How does the sticky bit work? The <code>SUID/GUID</code> is the same?</b></summary><br>\n\nThis is probably one of my most irksome things that people mess up all the time. The **SUID/GUID** bit and the **sticky-bit** are 2 completely different things.\n\nIf you do a `man chmod` you can read about the **SUID** and **sticky-bits**.\n\n**SUID/GUID**\n\nWhat the above man page is trying to say is that the position that the x bit takes in the rwxrwxrwx for the user octal (1st group of rwx) and the group octal (2nd group of rwx) can take an additional state where the x becomes an s. When this occurs this file when executed (if it\'s a program and not just a shell script) will run with the permissions of the owner or the group of the file.\n\nSo if the file is owned by root and the **SUID** bit is turned on, the program will run as root. Even if you execute it as a regular user. The same thing applies to the **GUID** bit.\n\nExamples:\n\n**no suid/guid** - just the bits `rwxr-xr-x` are set.\n\n```bash\nls -lt b.pl\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 179 Jan  9 01:01 b.pl\n```\n\n**suid & user\'s executable bit enabled (lowercase s)** - the bits `rwsr-x-r-x` are set.\n\n```bash\nchmod u+s b.pl\nls -lt b.pl\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 179 Jan  9 01:01 b.pl\n```\n\n**suid enabled & executable bit disabled (uppercase S)** - the bits `rwSr-xr-x` are set.\n\n```bash\nchmod u-x b.pl\nls -lt b.pl\n-rwSr-xr-x 1 root root 179 Jan  9 01:01 b.pl\n```\n\n**guid & group\'s executable bit enabled (lowercase s)** - the bits `rwxr-sr-x` are set.\n\n```bash\nchmod g+s b.pl\nls -lt b.pl\n-rwxr-sr-x 1 root root 179 Jan  9 01:01 b.pl\n```\n\n**guid enabled & executable bit disabled (uppercase S)** - the bits `rwxr-Sr-x` are set.\n\n```bash\nchmod g-x b.pl\nls -lt b.pl\n-rwxr-Sr-x 1 root root 179 Jan  9 01:01 b.pl\n```\n\n**sticky bit**\n\nThe sticky bit on the other hand is denoted as `t`, such as with the `/tmp` directory:\n\n```bash\nls -l /|grep tmp\ndrwxrwxrwt. 168 root root 28672 Jun 14 08:36 tmp\n```\n\nThis bit should have always been called the _restricted deletion bit_ given that\'s what it really connotes. When this mode bit is enabled, it makes a directory such that users can only delete files & directories within it that they are the owners of.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [How does the sticky bit work?

This sets all `LC_` type variables at once to a specified locale.\n\nThe main reason to set `LC_ALL=C` before command is that fine to simply get English output (general change the locale used by the command).\n\nOn the other hand, also important is to increase the speed of command execution with `LC_ALL=C` e.g. `grep` or `fgrep`. Using the `LC_ALL=C` locale increased our performance and brought command execution time down.\n\nFor example, if you set `LC_ALL=en_US.utf8` your system opened multiple files from the `/usr/lib/locale` directory.

If the web servers is Apache, default owner/group are **apache:apache** or **www-data:www-data** and for Nginx it will be **nginx:nginx**. Don\'t change these settings.\n\nIf applications works with app servers like a **uwsgi** or **php-fpm** should set the appropriate user and group (e.g. for **app01** it will be **u01-prod:g01-prod**) in specific config files.\n\n**6) Permissions**\n\nSet properly permissions with **Access Control Lists**:\n\n```bash\n# For web server\nsetfacl -Rdm "g:apache:rwx" /var/www/app01\nsetfacl -Rm "g:apache:rwx" /var/www/app01\n\n# For developers\nsetfacl -Rdm "g:g01-prod:rwx" /var/www/app01\nsetfacl -Rm "g:g01-prod:rwx" /var/www/app01\n```\n\nIf you use **SELinux** remember about security context:\n\n```bash\nchcon -R system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/app01\n```\n\n**7) Security mistakes**\n\n- **root** owner for files and directories\n- **root** never executes any files in website directory, and shouldn\'t be creating files in there\n- to wide permissions like a **777** so some critical files may be world-writable and world-readable\n- avoid creating maintenance scripts or other critical files with suid root\n\nIf you allow your site to modify the files which form the code running your site, you make it much easier for someone to take over your server.\n\nA file upload tool allows users to upload a file with any name and any contents.

How to find file\'s inode number and how can you use it?</b></summary><br>\n\nAn **inode** is a data structure on a filesystem on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that stores all the information about a file except its name and its actual data. A data structure is a way of storing data so that it can be used efficiently.\n\nA Unix file is stored in two different parts of the disk - the data blocks and the inodes. I won\'t get into superblocks and other esoteric information. The data blocks contain the "contents" of the file. The information about the file is stored elsewhere - in the inode.\n\nA file\'s inode number can easily be found by using the `ls` command, which by default lists the objects (i.e. files, links and directories) in the current directory (i.e. the directory in which the user is currently working), with its `-i` option. Thus, for example, the following will show the name of each object in the current directory together with its inode number:\n\n```bash\nls -i\n```\n\n`df\'s` `-i` option instructs it to supply information about inodes on each filesystem rather than about available space. Specifically, it tells df to return for each mounted filesystem the total number of inodes, the number of free inodes, the number of used inodes and the percentage of inodes used. This option can be used together with the `-h` option as follows to make the output easier to read:\n\n```bash\ndf -hi\n```\n\n**Finding files by inodes**\n\nIf you know the inode, you can find it using the find command:\n\n```bash\nfind . -inum 435304 -print\n```\n\n**Deleting files with strange names**\n\nSometimes files are created with strange characters in the filename. The Unix file system will allow any character as part of a filename except for a null (ASCII 000) or a "/". Every other character is allowed.\n\nUsers can create files with characters that make it difficult to see the directory or file. They can create the directory ".. " with a space at the end, or create a file that has a backspace in the name, using:\n\n```bash\ntouch `printf "aa\\bb"`\n```\n\nNow what what happens when you use the `ls` command:\n\n```bash\nls\naa?b\nls | grep \'a\'\nab\n```\n\nNote that when `ls` sends the result to a terminal, it places a "**?**" in the filename to show an unprintable character.\n\nYou can get rid of this file by using `rm -i *` and it will prompt you before it deletes each file. But you can also use `find` to remove the file, once you know the inode number.\n\n```bash\nls -i\n435304 aa?b\nfind . -inum 435304 -delete\n```\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Understand UNIX/Linux Inodes Basics with Examples](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/01/linux-inodes/)\n- [What is an inode as defined by POSIX?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/387087/what-is-an-inode-as-defined-by-posix/387093)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b><code>ls -l</code> shows file attributes as question marks. What this means and what steps will you take to remove unused "zombie" files?</b></summary><br>\n\nThis problem may be more difficult to solve because several steps may be required - sometimes you have get `test/file: Permission denied`, `test/file: No such file or directory` or `test/file: Input/output error`.\n\nThat happens when the user can\'t do a `stat()` on the files (which requires execute permissions), but can read the directory entries (which requires read access on the directory). So you get a list of files in the directory, but can\'t get any information on the files because they can\'t be read. If you have a directory which has read permission but not execute, you\'ll see this.\n\nSome processes like a `rsync` generates temporary files that get created and dropped fast which will cause errors if you try to call other simple file management commands like `rm`, `mv` etc.\n\nExample of output:\n\n```bash\n?????????? ? ?        ?               ?            ? sess_kee6fu9ag7tiph2jae\n```\n\n1) change permissions: `chmod 0777 sess_kee6fu9ag7tiph2jae` and try remove\n2) change owner: `chown root:root sess_kee6fu9ag7tiph2jae` and try remove\n3) change permissions and owner for directory: `chmod -R 0777 dir/ && chown -R root:root dir/` and try remove\n4) recreate file: `touch sess_kee6fu9ag7tiph2jae` and try remove\n5) watch out for other running processes on the server for example `rsync`, sometimes you can see this as a transient error when an NFS server is heavily overloaded\n6) find file inode: `ls -i`, and try remove: `find . -inum <inode_num> -delete`\n7) remount (if possible) your filesystem\n8) boot system into single-user mode and repair your filesystem with `fsck`\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Question marks showing in ls of directory.

What should you watch out for?</b></summary><br>\n\nIn a bash script, you have several ways to check if the running user is root.\n\nAs a warning, do not check if a user is root by using the root username. Nothing guarantees that the user with ID 0 is called root. It\'s a very strong convention that is broadly followed but anybody could rename the superuser another name.\n\nI think the best way when using bash is to use `$EUID` because `$UID` could be changed and not reflect the real user running the script.\n\n```bash\nif (( $EUID != 0 )); then\n  echo "Please run as root"\n  exit\nfi\n```\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Can you give a particular example when is indicated to use <code>nobody</code> account? Tell me the differences running httpd service as a <code>nobody</code> and <code>www-data</code> accounts.</b></summary><br>\n\nIn many Unix variants, `nobody` is the conventional name of a user account which owns no files, is in no privileged groups, and has no abilities except those which every other user has.\n\nIt is common to run daemons as `nobody`, especially servers, in order to limit the damage that could be done by a malicious user who gained control of them.\n\nHowever, the usefulness of this technique is reduced if more than one daemon is run like this, because then gaining control of one daemon would provide control of them all. The reason is that `nobody`-owned processes have the ability to send signals to each other and even debug each other, allowing them to read or even modify each other\'s memory.\n\n**When should I use `nobody` account?**\n\nWhen permissions aren\'t required for a program\'s operations. This is most notable when there isn\'t ever going to be any disk activity.\n\nA real world example of this is **memcached** (a key-value in-memory cache/database/thing), sitting on my computer and my server running under the `nobody` account. Why? Because it just doesn\'t need any permissions and to give it an account that did have write access to files would just be a needless risk.\n\nA good example are also web servers. Imagine if Apache ran as root and someone found a way to send custom commands to the console through Apache would have access to your entire system.\n\n`nobody` account also is used as a restricted shell for giving users filesystem access without an actual shell like bash. This should prevent them from being able to execute things.\n\n**`nobody` or `www-data` for httpd (Apache)**\n\nUpon starting Apache needs root access, but it quickly drops this and assumes the identity of a non privileged user. This user can either be `nobody` or `apache`, or `www-data`.\n\nSeveral applications use the user `nobody` as a default. For example you probably never really want say the Apache service to be overwriting files that belong to bind. Having a per-service account tends to be a very good idea.\n\nGetting Apache to run as `nobody:nobody` is pretty easy, just update the user and group settings. But as I mentioned above I don\'t really recommend that particular user/group. It is entirely possible that you may be tempted to add a service to the system at some time in the future that also runs as `nobody`, and you will forget that have given write access on the filesystem to the user `nobody`.\n\n If somehow, `nobody` were to become compromised they could potentially have more impact than if an application isolate user, such as `www-data`. Of course a lot of this will depend on the file and group permissions. `nobody` uses the permissions of others, while an application specific user could be configured to allow file read access, but other could still be denied.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [What is nobody user and group?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/186568/what-is-nobody-user-and-group)\n- [The Linux and Unix Nobody User](http://linuxg.net/the-linux-and-unix-nobody-user/)\n- [What is the purpose of the \'nobody\' user?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/329714/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-nobody-user)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Is there a way to redirect output to a file and have it display on stdout?</b></summary><br>\n\nThe command you want is named tee:\n\n`foo | tee output.file`\n\nFor example, if you only care about stdout:\n\n`ls -a | tee output.file`\n\nIf you want to include stderr, do:\n\n`program [arguments...] 2>&1 | tee outfile`\n\n`2>&1` redirects channel 2 (stderr/standard error) into channel 1 (stdout/standard output), such that both is written as stdout.

They issue Root certificates which are usually pre-installed within all browsers, mobiles, and applications. The private key of these certificates is used to sign other subsequent certificates called intermediate certificates. Root CAs are usually kept "offline\xe2\x80\x9d and in a highly secure environment with stringently limited access.\n\n**Intermediates CAs** are CAs that subordinate to the Root CA by one or more levels, being trusted by these to sign certificates on their behalf. The purpose of creating and using Intermediate CAs is primarily for security because if the intermediate private key is compromised, then the Root CA can revoke the intermediate certificate and create a new one with a new cryptographic key pair.\n\n**SSL Certificate Chain Trust** is the list of SSL certificates, from the root certificate to the end entity/server certificate. For an SSL Certificate to be trusted, it must be issued by a trusted CAs which is included in the trusted CA list of the connecting device (browser, mobile, and application). Therefore, the connecting device will test the trustworthiness of each SSL Certificate in the Chain Trust until it matches the one issued by a trusted CA.\n\nThe **Root-Intermediate CA** structure is created by each major CA to protect against the disastrous effects of a root key compromise. If a root key is compromised, it would render the root and all subordinated certificates untrustworthy. For this reason, creating an Intermediate CA is a best practice to ensure a rigorous protection of the primary root key.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [How certificate chains work](https://knowledge.digicert.com/solution/SO16297.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>How to reload PostgreSQL after configuration changes?</b></summary><br>\n\nSolution 1:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl reload postgresql\n```\n\nSolution 2:\n\n```\nsu - postgres\n/usr/bin/pg_ctl reload\n```\n\nSolution 3:\n\n```\nSELECT pg_reload_conf();\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>You have added several aliases to <code>.profile</code>.

Have I been compromised?</b></summary><br>\n\n**toor** is an alternative superuser account, where toor is root spelled backwards. It is intended to be used with a non-standard shell so the default shell for root does not need to change.\n\nThis is important as shells which are not part of the base distribution, but are instead installed from ports or packages, are installed in `/usr/local/bin` which, by default, resides on a different file system. If root\'s shell is located in `/usr/local/bin` and the file system containing `/usr/local/bin`) is not mounted, root will not be able to log in to fix a problem and will have to reboot into single-user mode in order to enter the path to a shell.\n\nSome people use toor for day-to-day root tasks with a non-standard shell, leaving root, with a standard shell, for single-user mode or emergencies. By default, a user cannot log in using toor as it does not have a password, so log in as root and set a password for toor before using it to login.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [The root account (and toor)](https://administratosphere.wordpress.com/2007/10/04/the-root-account-and-toor/)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Is there an easy way to search inside 1000s of files in a complex directory structure to find files which contain a specific string?</b></summary><br>\n\nFor example use `fgrep`:\n\n```bash\nfgrep * -R "string"\n```\n\nor:\n\n```bash\ngrep -insr "pattern" *\n```\n\n- `-i` ignore case distinctions in both the **PATTERN** and the input files\n- `-n`  prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file\n- `-s` suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.\n- `-r` read all files under each directory, recursively.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [How to grep a string in a directory and all its subdirectories files in LINUX?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15622328/how-to-grep-a-string-in-a-directory-and-all-its-subdirectories-files-in-linux)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>How to find out the dynamic libraries executables loads when run?</b></summary><br>\n\nYou can do this with `ldd` command:\n\n```bash\nldd /bin/ls\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>You have the task of sync the testing and production environments.

You can create instances with an exact copy of your production environment under a dev/test with snapshots, for example:\n\n- generate a snapshot of production\n- copy the snapshot to staging (or other)\n- create a new disk using this snapshot\n\nSure, you can spin up clones of various system components or entire systems, and capture real traffic to replay offline (the gold standard of systems testing). But many systems are too big, complex, and cost-prohibitive to clone.\n\nBefore environment synchronization a good way is keeping track of every change that you make to the testing environment and provide a way for propagating this to the production environment, so that you do not skip any step and do it as smoothly as possible.\n\nAlso structure comparison tool or deploy scripts that update the testing environment from production environment is a good solution.\n\n**Presync tasks**\n\nFirst of all is informing developers and clients about not making changes on the test environment (if possible, disabling test domains that target this environment or set static pages with information about synchronization).\n\nIt is also important to make backup/snapshots of both environments.\n\n**Database servers**\n\n- sync/update system version (e.g. packages)\n- create dump file from database on production db server\n- import dump file on testing db server\n- if necessary, syncs login permissions, roles, database permissions, open connections to the database and other\n\n**Web/App servers**\n\n- sync/update system version (e.g. packages)\n- if necessary, updated kernel parameters, firewall rules and other\n- sync/update configuration files of all running/important services\n- sync/update user accounts (e.g. permissions) and their home directories\n- deploy project from git/svn repository\n- sync/update important directories existing in project, e.g. **static**, **asset** and other\n- sync/update permissions for project directory\n- remove/update all webhooks\n- update cron jobs\n\n**Others tasks**\n\n- updated configurations of load balancers for testing domains and specific urls\n- updated configurations of queues, session and storage instances\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Keeping testing and production server environments clean, in sync, and consistent](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/639668/keeping-testing-and-production-server-environments-clean-in-sync-and-consisten)\n\n</details>\n\n###### Network Questions (24)\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Configure a virtual interface on your workstation. ***</b></summary><br>\n\nTo be completed.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>According to an HTTP monitor, a website is down.

This can easily happen when connecting to a computer who\'s host keys in `/etc/ssh` have changed if that computer was upgraded without copying its old host keys. The host keys here are proof when you reconnect to a remote computer with ssh that you are talking to the same computer you connected to the first time you accessed it.\n\nWhenever you connect to a server via SSH, that server\'s public key is stored in your home directory (or possibly in your local account settings if using a Mac or Windows desktop) file called **known_hosts**.

Why it is incorrect behavior and what is the better (but not ideal) solution in such situations?</b></summary><br>\n\nYou have the private key for your personal account. The server needs your public key so that it can verify that your private key for the account you are trying to use is authorized.\n\nThe whole point with private keys is that they are private, meaning only you have your private key. If someone takes over your private key, it will be able to impersonate you any time he wants.\n\nA better solutions is the use of ssh key forwarding. An essence, you need to create a `~/.ssh/config` file, if it doesn\'t exist. Then, add the hosts (either domain name or IP address in the file and set `ForwardAgent yes`). Example:\n\n```bash\nHost git.example.com\n    User john\n    PreferredAuthentications publickey\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.git.example.com\n    ForwardAgent yes\n```\n\nYour remote server must allow SSH agent forwarding on inbound connections and your local `ssh-agent` must be running.\n\nForwarding an ssh agent carries its own security risk. If someone on the remote machine can gain access to your forwarded ssh agent connection, they can still make use of your keys. However, this is better than storing keys on remote machines: the attacker can only use the ssh agent connection, not the key itself. Thus, only while you\'re logged into the remote machine can they do anything. If you store the key on the remote machine, they can make a copy of it and use it whenever they want.\n\nIf you use ssh keys remember about passphrases which is strongly recommended to reduce risk of keys accidentally leaking.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [How to forward local keypair in a SSH session?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12257968/how-to-forward-local-keypair-in-a-ssh-session)\n- [Using SSH agent forwarding](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/using-ssh-agent-forwarding/)\n- [SSH Agent Forwarding considered harmful](https://heipei.github.io/2015/02/26/SSH-Agent-Forwarding-considered-harmful/)\n- [Security Consideration while using ssh-agent](https://www.commandprompt.com/blog/security_considerations_while_using_ssh-agent/)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What is the difference between CORS and CSPs?</b></summary><br>\n\n**CORS** allows the **Same Origin Policy** to be relaxed for a domain.\n\ne.g. normally if the user logs into both `example.com` and `example.org`, the Same Origin Policy prevents `example.com` from making an AJAX request to `example.org/current_user/full_user_details` and gaining access to the response.\n\nThis is the default policy of the web and prevents the user\'s data from being leaked when logged into multiple sites at the same time.\n\nNow with **CORS**, `example.org` could set a policy to say it will allow the origin `https://example.com` to read responses made by AJAX. This would be done if both `example.com` and `example.org` are ran by the same company and data sharing between the origins is to be allowed in the user\'s browser. It only affects the client-side of things, not the server-side.\n\n**CSPs** on the other hand set a policy of what content can run on the current site. For example, if JavaScript can be executed inline, or which domains `.js` files can be loaded from. This can be beneficial to act as another line of defense against **XSS** attacks, where the attacker will try and inject script into the HTML page. Normally output would be encoded, however say the developer had forgotten only on one output field. Because the policy is preventing in-line script from executing, the attack is thwarted.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [What is the difference between CORS and CSPs?

Explain.</b></summary><br>\n\n**Monolithic Kernels**\n\nEarlier in this type of kernel architecture, all the basic system services like a process and memory management, interrupt handling etc were packaged into a single module in kernel space. This type of architecture led to some serious drawbacks like:\n\n- the size of the kernel, which was huge\n- poor maintainability, which means bug fixing or addition of new features resulted in recompilation of the whole kernel which could consume hours\n\nIn a modern day approach to monolithic architecture, the kernel consists of different modules which can be dynamically loaded and unloaded. This modular approach allows easy extension of OS\'s capabilities. With this approach, maintainability of kernel became very easy as only the concerned module needs to be loaded and unloaded every time there is a change or bug fix in a particular module.\n\nLinux follows the monolithic modular approach.\n\n**Microkernels**\n\nThis architecture majorly caters to the problem of ever growing size of kernel code which we could not control in the monolithic approach. This architecture allows some basic services like device driver management, protocol stack, file system etc to run in user space.\n\nIn this architecture, all the basic OS services which are made part of user space are made to run as servers which are used by other programs in the system through inter process communication (IPC).\n\nExample: We have servers for device drivers, network protocol stacks, file systems, graphics, etc. Microkernel servers are essentially daemon programs like any others, except that the kernel grants some of them privileges to interact with parts of physical memory that are otherwise off limits to most programs.\n\n**Hybrid Kernels (Modular Kernels)**\n\nThis is a combination of the above two, where the key idea is that Operating System services are in Kernel Space, and there is no message passing, no performance overhead and no reliability benefits, of having services in user space.\n\nThis is used by Microsoft\'s NT kernels, all the way up to the latest Windows version.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [An Introduction to Kernels.

If they change their password they will expect that change to be global.\n\nIt also has a relationship with names and group names in Unix and Linux. They are mapped into numeric forms (**UID\'s** and **GID\'s** respectively). All file ownership (inodes) and processes use these numerics for all access and identity determination throughout the kernel and drivers. These numeric values are reverse mapped back to their corresponding principle symbolic representations (the names) by the utilities that display or process that information.\n\nIt is also recommended that you adopt a policy that **UID\'s** are not re-used. When a user leaves your organization you "retire" their **UID** (disabling their access by \\*\'ing out their passwd, removing them from the groups maps, setting their "shell" to some `/bin/denied` binary and their home directory to a secured _graveyard_ - I use `/home/.graveyard` on my systems).\n\nThe reason for this may not be obvious. However, if you are maintaining archival backups for several years (or indefinitely) you\'ll want to avoid any ambiguities and confusion that might result from restoring one (long gone) user\'s files and finding them owned by one of your new users.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [UID/GID Synchronization and Management (original)](https://linuxgazette.net/issue31/tag_uidgid.html)\n- [What\'s the advantage of synchronizing UID/GID across Linux machines?](https://serverfault.com/questions/603987/whats-the-advantage-of-synchronizing-uid-gid-across-linux-machines)\n- [How can I keep user accounts consistent across multiple machines?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/141023/how-can-i-keep-user-acccounts-consistent-accross-multiple-machines)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What principles to follow for successful system performance tuning? ***</b></summary><br>\n\nTo be completed.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [An Introduction to Performance Tuning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/system-performance-tuning/059600284X/ch01.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Describe start-up configuration files and directory in BSD systems.</b></summary><br>\n\nIn BSD the primary start-up configuration file is `/etc/defaults/rc.conf`.

How can you prevent such situations?</b></summary><br>\n\n**Create disaster recovery plan**\n\nDisaster recovery and business continuity planning are integral parts of the overall risk management for an organization. Is a documented process or set of procedures to recover and protect a business IT infrastructure.\n\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a recovery solution, then your restoration efforts will become rebuilding efforts, starting from scratch to recreate whatever was lost.\n\nYou should use commonly occurring real life data disaster scenarios to simulate what your backups will and won\xe2\x80\x99t do in a crisis.\n\n**Create disaster recovery center**\n\nAs a result, in the event of unplanned interruptions in the functioning of the primary location, service and all operational activities are switched to the backup center and therefore the unavailability of services is limited to the absolute minimum.\n\nDoes the facility have sufficient bandwidth options and power to scale and deal with the increased load during a major disaster? Are resources available to periodically test failover?\n\n**Create regular backups and tested it!**\n\nBackups are a way to protect the investment in data. By having several copies of the data, it does not matter as much if one is destroyed (the cost is only that of the restoration of the lost data from the backup).\n\nWhen you lose data, one thing is certain: downtime.\n\nTo assure the validity and integrity of any backup, it\'s essential to carry out regular restoration tests. Ideally, a test should be conducted after every backup completes to ensure data can be successfully secured and recovered. However, this often isn\'t practical due to a lack of available resources or time constraints.\n\nMake backups of entire virtual machines and important components in the middle of them.\n\n**Create snapshots: vm, disks or lvm**\n\nSnapshots are perfect if you want to recover a server from a previous state but it\'s only a "quick method", it cannot restore the system after too many items changed.\n\nCreate them always before making changes on production environments (and not only).\n\nDisk snapshots are used to generate a snapshot of an entire disk. These snapshots don\'t make it easy to restore individual chunks of data (e.g. a lost user account), though it\'s possible. The primary purpose is to restore entire disks in case of disk failure.\n\nThe LVM snapshots can be primarily used to easily copy data from production environment to staging environment.\n\nRemember: Snapshots are not backups!\n\n**Development and testing environments**\n\nA production environment is the real instance of the application and its database used by the company or the clients. The production database has all the real data.\n\nSetting up development environments based directly on the production database, instead of using a backup for this (removing the need for the above). Dev and test environment that your engineers can get to and a prod environment that only a few people can push updates to following an approved change.\n\nAll environments such as prod, dev and test should have one major difference: authorization data for services. For example postgres database instance on testing environment should be consistent (if possible) with the production base, however, in order to eliminate errors of database names and logins and passwords for authorization should be different.\n\n**Single point of failure**\n\nThe general method to avoid single points of failures is to provide redundant components for each necessary resource, so service can continue if a component fails.\n\n**Synchronization and replication process for databases**\n\nThe replication procedure is super fragile and prone to error.\n\nA good idea is also slightly longer delay of data replication (e.g. for DRC). As in replicas, the data changes will usually be replicated within minutes, so the lost data won\xe2\x80\x99t be on the replica database either once that happens.\n\n**Create database model with users, roles and rights, use different methods of protection**\n\nOnly very advanced devs have permissions for db admin access. The other really don\'t need write access to clone a database. On the other hand just don\'t give a developer write access to prod.\n\nThe production database should refuse connections from any server and pc which isn\'t the one running the production application, even if it provides a valid username/password.\n\nHow the hell development machines can access a production database right like that? How about a simple firewall rule to just let the servers needing the DB data access the database?\n\n**Create summary/postmortem documents after failures**\n\nThe post-mortem audience includes customers, direct reports, peers, the company\'s executive team and often investors.\n\nExplain what caused the outage on a timeline. Every incident begins with a specific trigger at a specific time, which often causes some unexpected behavior. For example, our servers were rebooted and we expected them to come back up intact, which didn\'t happen.\n\nFurthermore, every incident has a root cause: the reboot itself was trigger, however a bug in the driver caused the actual outage. Finally, there are consequences to every incident, the most obvious one is that the site goes down.\n\nThe post-mortem answers the single most important question of what could have prevented the outage.\n\nDespite how painful an outage may have been, the worst thing you can do is to bury it and never properly close the incident in a clear and transparent way.\n\n**If you also made a big mistake...**\n\n  > "*Humans are just apes with bigger computers.*" - african_cheetah (Reddit)\n  >\n  > "*I\'ve come to appreciate not having access to things I don\'t absolutely need.*" - warm_vanilla_sugar (Reddit)\n  >\n  > Document whatever happened somewhere.

I\'m describing a simple typical architecture, real architectures can be more complex or differ in ways that don\'t matter at this level of detail.\n\nWhen an **interrupt** occurs, the processor looks if interrupts are masked. If they are, nothing happens until they are unmasked. When interrupts become unmasked, if there are any pending interrupts, the processor picks one.\n\nThen the processor executes the interrupt by branching to a particular address in memory. The code at that address is called the **interrupt handler**. When the processor branches there, it masks interrupts (so the interrupt handler has exclusive control) and saves the contents of some registers in some place (typically other registers).\n\nThe interrupt handler does what it must do, typically by communicating with the peripheral that triggered the interrupt to send or receive data. If the interrupt was raised by the timer, the handler might trigger the OS scheduler, to switch to a different thread. When the handler finishes executing, it executes a special return-from-interrupt instruction that restores the saved registers and unmasks interrupts.\n\nThe interrupt handler must run quickly, because it\'s preventing any other interrupt from running. In the Linux kernel, interrupt processing is divided in two parts:\n\n- The "top half" is the interrupt handler. It does the minimum necessary, typically communicate with the hardware and set a flag somewhere in kernel memory.\n- The "bottom half" does any other necessary processing, for example copying data into process memory, updating kernel data structures, etc. It can take its time and even block waiting for some other part of the system since it runs with interrupts enabled.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [How is an Interrupt handled in Linux?

Describe exceptions for which the use of SIGKILL is insufficient.</b></summary><br>\n\n`kill -9` (`SIGKILL`) always works, provided you have the permission to kill the process. Basically either the process must be started by you and not be setuid or setgid, or you must be root. There is one exception: even root cannot send a fatal signal to PID 1 (the init process).\n\nHowever `kill -9` is not guaranteed to work immediately. All signals, including `SIGKILL`, are delivered asynchronously: the kernel may take its time to deliver them. Usually, delivering a signal takes at most a few microseconds, just the time it takes for the target to get a time slice. However, if the target has blocked the signal, the signal will be queued until the target unblocks it.\n\nNormally, processes cannot block `SIGKILL`. But kernel code can, and processes execute kernel code when they call system calls.\n\nA process blocked in a system call is in uninterruptible sleep. The `ps` or `top` command will (on most unices) show it in state **D**.\n\nTo remove a **D** State Process, since it is uninterruptible, only a machine reboot can solve the problem in case its not automatically handled by the system.\n\nUsually there is a very few chance that a process stays in **D** State for long. And if it does then there is something not properly being handled in the system. This can be a potential bug as well.\n\nA classical case of long uninterruptible sleep is processes accessing files over NFS when the server is not responding; modern implementations tend not to impose uninterruptible sleep (e.g. under Linux, the intr mount option allows a signal to interrupt NFS file accesses).\n\nYou may sometimes see entries marked **Z** (or **H** under Linux) in the `ps` or `top` output. These are technically not processes, they are zombie processes, which are nothing more than an entry in the process table, kept around so that the parent process can be notified of the death of its child. They will go away when the parent process pays attention (or dies).\n\nSummary exceptions:\n\n- Zombie processes cannot be killed since they are already dead and waiting for their parent processes to reap them\n- Processes that are in the blocked state will not die until they wake up again\n- The init process is special: It does not get signals that it does not want to handle, and thus it can ignore **SIGKILL**. An exception from this exception is while init is ptraced on Linux\n- An uninterruptibly sleeping process may not terminate (and free its resources) even when sent **SIGKILL**. This is one of the few cases in which a Unix system may have to be rebooted to solve a temporary software problem\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [What if kill -9 does not work?

One of the results is that the shell won\'t send it a **SIGHUP**. Obviously, it can only be applied to background jobs, because you cannot enter it when a foreground job is running\n- `nohup` disconnects the process from the terminal, redirects its output to `nohup.out` and shields it from **SIGHUP**. One of the effects (the naming one) is that the process won\'t receive any sent **SIGHUP**. It is completely independent from job control and could in principle be used also for foreground jobs (although that\'s not very useful)\n\nIf you use all three together, the process is running in the background, is removed from the shell\'s job control and is effectively disconnected from the terminal.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Difference between nohup, disown and & (original)](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3886/difference-between-nohup-disown-and)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What is the main advantage of using <code>chroot</code>? When and  why do we use it? What is the purpose of the mount dev, proc, sys in a chroot environment?</b></summary><br>\n\nAn advantage of having a chroot environment is the file-system is totally isolated from the physical host. `chroot` has a separate file-system inside the file-system, the difference is its uses a newly created root(/) as its root directory.\n\nA chroot jail is a way to isolate a process and its children from the rest of the system. It should only be used for processes that don\'t run as root, as root users can break out of the jail very easily.\n\nThe idea is that you create a directory tree where you copy or link in all the system files needed for a process to run. You then use the `chroot()` system call to change the root directory to be at the base of this new tree and start the process running in that chroot\'d environment. Since it can\'t actually reference paths outside the modified root, it can\'t perform operations (read/write etc.) maliciously on those locations.\n\nOn Linux, using a bind mounts is a great way to populate the chroot tree. Using that, you can pull in folders like `/lib` and `/usr/lib` while not pulling in `/usr`, for example. Just bind the directory trees you want to directories you create in the jail directory.\n\nChroot environment is useful for:\n\n- reinstall bootloader\n- reset a forgotten password\n- perform a kernel upgrade (or downgrade)\n- rebuild your initramdisk\n- fix your **/etc/fstab**\n- reinstall packages using your package manager\n- whatever\n\nWhen working in a chrooted environment, there is a few special file systems that needs to be mounted so all programs behave properly.\n\nLimitation is that `/dev`, `/sys` and `/proc` are not mounted by default but needed for many tasks.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Its all about Chroot](https://medium.com/@itseranga/chroot-316dc3c89584)\n- [Best Practices for UNIX chroot() Operations](http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/chroot-practices.html)\n- [Is there an easier way to chroot than bind-mounting?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/32418/is-there-an-easier-way-to-chroot-than-bind-mounting)\n- [What\'s the proper way to prepare chroot to recover a broken Linux installation?](https://superuser.com/questions/111152/whats-the-proper-way-to-prepare-chroot-to-recover-a-broken-linux-installation)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What are segmentation faults (segfaults), and how can identify what\'s causing them?</b></summary><br>\n\nA **segmentation fault** (aka _segfault_) is a common condition that causes programs to crash. Segfaults are caused by a program trying to read or write an illegal memory location.\n\nProgram memory is divided into different segments:\n\n- a text segment for program instructions\n- a data segment for variables and arrays defined at compile time\n- a stack segment for temporary (or automatic) variables defined in subroutines and functions\n- a heap segment for variables allocated during runtime by functions, such as `malloc` (in C)\n\nIn practice, segfaults are almost always due to trying to read or write a non-existent array element, not properly defining a pointer before using it, or (in C programs) accidentally using a variable\'s value as an address. Thus, when Process A reads memory location 0x877, it reads information residing at a different physical location in RAM than when Process B reads its own 0x877.\n\nAll modern operating systems support and use segmentation, and so all can produce a segmentation fault.\n\nSegmentation fault can also occur under following circumstances:\n\n- a buggy program/command, which can be only fixed by applying patch\n- it can also appear when you try to access an array beyond the end of an array under C programming\n- inside a chrooted jail this can occur when critical shared libs, config file or `/dev/` entry missing\n- sometime hardware or faulty memory or driver can also create problem\n- maintain suggested environment for all computer equipment (overheating can also generate this problem)\n\nTo debug this kind of error try one or all of the following techniques:\n\n- enable core files: `$ ulimit -c unlimited`\n- reproduce the crash: `$ ./<program>`\n- debug crash with gdb: `$ gdb <program> [core file]`\n- or run `LD_PRELOAD=...path-to.../libSegFault.so <program>` to get a report with backtrace, loaded libs, etc\n\nAlso:\n\n- make sure correct hardware installed and configured\n- always apply all patches and use updated system\n- make sure all dependencies installed inside jail\n- turn on core dumping for supported services such as Apache\n- use `strace` which is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool\n\nSometimes segmentation faults are not caused by bugs in the program but are caused instead by system memory limits being set too low. Usually it is the limit on stack size that causes this kind of problem (stack overflows). To check memory limits, use the `ulimit` command in bash.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [What are segmentation faults (segfaults), and how can I identify what\'s causing them?

File descriptors form part of the POSIX application programming interface.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Which way of additionally feeding random entropy pool would you suggest for producing random passwords? How to improve it?</b></summary><br>\n\nYou should use `/dev/urandom`, not `/dev/random`. The two differences between `/dev/random` and `/dev/urandom` are:\n\n - `/dev/random` might be theoretically better _in the context of an information-theoretically secure algorithm_. This is the kind of algorithm which is secure against today\'s technology, and also tomorrow\'s technology, and technology used by aliens, and God\'s own iPad as well.\n\n - `/dev/urandom` will not block, while `/dev/random` may do so. `/dev/random` maintains a counter of "how much entropy it still has" under the assumption that any bits it has produced is a lost entropy bit. Blocking induces very real issues, e.g. a server which fails to boot after an automated install because it is stalling on its SSH server key creation.\n\nSo you want to use `/dev/urandom` and stop to worry about this entropy business.\n\nThe trick is that `/dev/urandom` never blocks, ever, even when it should: `/dev/urandom` is secure as long as it has received enough bytes of "initial entropy" since the last boot (32 random bytes are enough). A normal Linux installation will create a random seed (from `/dev/random`) upon installation, and save it on the disk. Upon each reboot, the seed will be read, fed into `/dev/urandom`, and a new seed immediately generated (from `/dev/urandom`) to replace it. Thus, this guarantees that `/dev/urandom` will always have enough initial entropy to produce cryptographically strong alea, perfectly sufficient for any mundane cryptographic job, including password generation.\n\nShould any of these daemons require randomness when all available entropy has been exhausted, they may pause to wait for more, which can cause excessive delays in your application. Even worse, since most modern applications will either resort to using its own random seed created at program initialization, or to using `/dev/urandom` to avoid blocking, your applications will suffer from lower quality random data. This can affect the integrity of your secure communications, and can increase the chance of cryptoanalysis on your private data.\n\nTo check the amount of bytes of entropy currently available, use:\n\n```bash\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail\n```\n\n**rng-tools**\n\nFedora/Rh/Centos types: `sudo yum install rng-tools`.\n\nOn deb types: `sudo apt-get install rng-tools` to set it up.\n\nThen run `sudo rngd -r /dev/urandom` before generating the keys.\n\n**haveged**\n\nFedora/Rh/Centos types: `sudo yum install haveged` and add `/usr/local/sbin/haveged -w 1024` to `/etc/rc.local`.\n\nOn deb types: `sudo apt-get install haveged` and add `DAEMON_ARGS="-w 1024"` to `/etc/default/haveged` to set it up.\n\nThen run `sudo rngd -r /dev/urandom` before generating the keys.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Feeding /dev/random entropy pool?

Something like this:\n\n```bash\nstrace -f -e trace=process bash -c \'ls; :\n```\n\n- `-f` : Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced processes as a result of the fork(2) system call.\n\n- `-ff` : If the `-o` filename option is in effect, each processes trace is written to filename.pid where pid is the numeric process id of each process. This is incompatible with `-c`, since no per-process counts are kept.\n\n**`ltrace -S` shows both system calls and library calls**\n\nThis awesome tool therefore gives even further visibility into what executables are doing.\n\n**`ftrace` minimal runnable example**\n\nHere goes a minimal runnable example. Run with `sudo`:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/sh\nset -eux\n\nd=debug/tracing\n\nmkdir -p debug\nif ! mountpoint -q debug; then\n  mount -t debugfs nodev debug\nfi\n\n# Stop tracing.\necho 0 > "${d}/tracing_on"\n\n# Clear previous traces.\necho > "${d}/trace"\n\n# Find the tracer name.\ncat "${d}/available_tracers"\n\n# Disable tracing functions, show only system call events.\necho nop > "${d}/current_tracer"\n\n# Find the event name with.\ngrep mkdir "${d}/available_events"\n\n# Enable tracing mkdir.\n# Both statements below seem to do the exact same thing,\n# just with different interfaces.\n# https://www.kernel.org/static/html/v4.18/trace/events.html\necho sys_enter_mkdir > "${d}/set_event"\n# echo 1 > "${d}/events/syscalls/sys_enter_mkdir/enable"\n\n# Start tracing.\necho 1 > "${d}/tracing_on"\n\n# Generate two mkdir calls by two different processes.\nrm -rf /tmp/a /tmp/b\nmkdir /tmp/a\nmkdir /tmp/b\n\n# View the trace.\ncat "${d}/trace"\n\n# Stop tracing.\necho 0 > "${d}/tracing_on"\n\numount debug\n```\n\nSample output:\n\n```bash\n# tracer: nop\n#\n#                              _-----=> irqs-off https://sourceware.org/systemtap/documentation.html\n#                             / _----=> need-resched\n#                            | / _---=> hardirq/softirq\n#                            || / _--=> preempt-depth\n#                            ||| /     delay\n#           TASK-PID   CPU#  ||||    TIMESTAMP  FUNCTION\n#              | |       |   ||||       |         |\n            mkdir-5619  [005] .... 10249.262531: sys_mkdir(pathname: 7fff93cbfcb0, mode: 1ff)\n            mkdir-5620  [003] .... 10249.264613: sys_mkdir(pathname: 7ffcdc91ecb0, mode: 1ff)\n```\n\nOne cool thing about this method is that it shows the function call for all processes on the system at once, although you can also filter PIDs of interest with `set_ftrace_pid`.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [How do I trace a system call in Linux?

When a properly protected password system receives a new password, it will create a hashed value for that password, create a new random salt value, and then store that combined value in its database. This helps defend against dictionary attacks and known hash attacks.\n\nFor example, if a user uses the same password on two different systems, if they used the same hashing algorithm, they could end up with the same hash value. However, if even one of the systems uses salt with its hashes, the values will be different.\n\nThe encrypted passwords in `/etc/shadow` file are stored in the following format:\n\n```bash\n$ID$SALT$ENCRYPTED\n```\n\nThe `$ID` indicates the type of encryption, the `$SALT` is a random (up to 16 characters) string and `$ENCRYPTED` is a password\xe2\x80\x99s hash.\n\n<table style="width:100%">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Hash Type</th>\n    <th>ID</th>\n    <th>Hash Length</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>MD5</td>\n    <td>$1</td>\n    <td>22 characters</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>SHA-256</td>\n    <td>$5</td>\n    <td>43 characters</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>SHA-512</td>\n    <td>$6</td>\n    <td>86 characters</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nUse the below commands from the Linux shell to generate hashed password for `/etc/shadow` with the random salt:\n\n- Generate **MD5** password hash\n\n```bash\npython -c "import random,string,crypt; randomsalt = \'\'.join(random.sample(string.ascii_letters,8)); print crypt.crypt(\'MySecretPassword\', \'\\$1\\$%s\\$\' % randomsalt)"\n```\n\n- Generate **SHA-256** password hash\n\n```bash\npython -c "import random,string,crypt; randomsalt = \'\'.join(random.sample(string.ascii_letters,8)); print crypt.crypt(\'MySecretPassword\', \'\\$5\\$%s\\$\' % randomsalt)"\n```\n\n- Generate **SHA-512** password hash\n\n```bash\npython -c "import random,string,crypt; randomsalt = \'\'.join(random.sample(string.ascii_letters,8)); print crypt.crypt(\'MySecretPassword\', \'\\$6\\$%s\\$\' % randomsalt)"\n```\n\n</details>\n\n###### Network Questions (27)\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Create SPF records for your site to help control spam. ***</b></summary><br>\n\nTo be completed.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What is the difference between an authoritative and a nonauthoritative answer to a DNS query? ***</b></summary><br>\n\nAn authoritative DNS query answer comes from the server that contains the zone files for the domain queried.

The resolver will only try the next nameserver if the first nameserver times out.\n\nThe algorithm used is to try a name server, and if the query times out, try the next, until out of name servers, then repeat trying all the name servers until a maximum number of retries are made.\n\nIf a nameserver responds with **SERVFAIL** or a referral (**nofail**) or terminate query (**fail**) also only the first dns server will be used.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nnameserver 192.168.250.20   # it\'s not a dns\nnameserver 8.8.8.8          # not store gate.test.int\nnameserver 127.0.0.1        # store gate.test.int\n```\n\nso if you check:\n\n```\nhost -v -t a gate.test.int\nTrying "gate.test.int"                        # trying first dns (192.168.250.20) but response is time out, so try the next nameserver\nHost gate.test.int not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)     # ok but response is NXDOMAIN (not found this domain name)\nReceived 88 bytes from 8.8.8.8#53 in 43 ms\nReceived 88 bytes from 8.8.8.8#53 in 43 ms\n                                              # so the last server in the list was not asked\n```\n\nTo avoid this you can use e.g. `nslookup` command which will use the second nameserver if it receives a **SERVFAIL** from the first nameserver.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Second nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf not picked up by wget](https://serverfault.com/questions/398837/second-nameserver-in-etc-resolv-conf-not-picked-up-by-wget)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Explore the current MTA configuration at your site.

However, some organizations need an SSL certificate issued to a public IP address. This option allows you to specify a public IP address as the Common Name in your Certificate Signing Request (CSR). The issued certificate can then be used to secure connections directly with the public IP address (e.g. `https://1.1.1.1`.).\n\nAccording to the CA Browser forum, there may be compatibility issues with certificates for IP addresses unless the IP address is in both the commonName and subjectAltName fields. This is due to legacy SSL implementations which are not aligned with RFC 5280, notably, Windows OS prior to Windows 10.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Are SSL certificates bound to the servers ip address?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1095780/are-ssl-certificates-bound-to-the-servers-ip-address)\n- [SSL certificate for a public IP address?](https://serverfault.com/questions/193775/ssl-certificate-for-a-public-ip-address)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>How do you do load testing and capacity planning for websites? ***</b></summary><br>\n\nTo be completed.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [How do you do load testing and capacity planning for web sites?

These files can reside in any and every directory in the directory tree of the website and provide features to the directory and the files and folders inside it.\n\n**It\xe2\x80\x99s horrible for performance**\n\nFor `.htaccess` to work Apache needs to check EVERY directory in the requested path for the existence of a `.htaccess` file and if it exists it reads EVERY one of them and parses it. This happens for EVERY request. Remember that the second you change that file, it\xe2\x80\x99s effective. This is because Apache reads it every time.\n\nEvery single request the web\xc2\xadserver handles\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89even for the lowliest `.png` or `.css` file\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89causes Apache to:\n\n- look for a `.htaccess` file in the directory of the current request\n- then look for a `.htaccess` file in every directory from there up to the server root\n- coalesce all of these `.htaccess` files together\n- reconfigure the web\xc2\xadserver using the new settings\n- finally, deliver the file\n\nEvery web\xc2\xadpage can generate dozens of requests. This is over\xc2\xadhead you don\xe2\x80\x99t need, and what\xe2\x80\x99s more, it\xe2\x80\x99s completely unnecessary.\n\n**Security and permission loss**\n\nAllowing individual users to modify the configuration of a server using `.htaccess` can cause security concerns if not taken care properly. If you add any directive in the `.htaccess` file, it will be considered as they are added to Apache configuration file.\n\nThis means it may be possible for non-admins to write these files and thus \'undo\' all of your security. If you need to do something that is temporary, `.htaccess` is a good place to do it, if you need to do something more permanent, just put it in your `/etc/apache/sites-available/site.conf` (or `httpd.conf` or whatever your server calls).\n\n**Summary**\n\nYou should avoid using `.htaccess` files completely if you have access to httpd main server config file. If it worked in `.htaccess`, it will work in your virtual host `.conf` file as well.\n\nIf you cannot avoid using `.htaccess` files, you should follow these rules.\n\n- use only one `.htaccess` file or as few as possible\n- place the `.htaccess` file in the site root directory\n- keep your `.htaccess` file short and simple\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Like Apache: .htaccess](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/likeapache-htaccess/)\n- [Don\'t Use .htaccess Unless You Must](https://www.danielmorell.com/guides/htaccess-seo/basics/dont-use-htaccess-unless-you-must)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Is it safe to use SNI SSL in production?

The load on a NFS system when you have 20 people simultaneously compiling a Linux kernel is completely different from a bunch of people logging in at the same time or the accounts uses as "home directories for the local web-server".\n\nBut we have some good tools for testing this.\n\n- <b>boonie</b> - a classical performances evaluation tool tests.

What is the most efficient way for the system to traverse the iptables rule set or the black-hole route?</b></summary><br>\n\nIf you have a system with thousands of routes defined in the routing table and nothing in the iptables rules than it might actually be more efficient to input an iptables rule.\n\nIn most systems however the routing table is fairly small, in cases like this it is actually more efficient to use null routes. This is especially true if you already have extensive iptables rules in place.\n\nAssuming you\'re blocking based on source address and not destination, then doing the **DROP** in **raw/PREROUTING** would work well as you would essentially be able to drop the packet before any routing decision is made.\n\nRemember however that iptables rules are essentially a linked-list and for optimum performance when blocking a number of addresses you should use an `ipset`.\n\nOn the other hand if blocking by destination, there is likely little difference between blocking at the routing table vs iptables **EXCEPT** if source IPs are spoofed in which case the blackholed entries may consume routing cache resources; in this case, **raw/PREROUTING** remains preferable.\n\nYour outgoing route isn\'t going to matter until you try to send a packet back to the attacker. By that time you will have already incurred most of the cost of socket setup and may even have a thread blocking waiting for the kernel to conclude you have no route to host, plus whatever error handling your server process does when it concludes there\'s a network problem.\n\niptables or another firewall will allow you to block the incoming traffic and discard it before it reaches the daemon process on your server. It seems clearly superior in this use case.\n\n```bash\niptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.200.0/24 -j DROP\n```\n\nWhen you define a route on a Linux/Unix system it tells the system in order to communicate with the specified IP address you will need to route your network communication to this specific place.\n\nWhen you define a null route it simply tells the system to drop the network communication that is designated to the specified IP address. What this means is any TCP based network communication will not be able to be established as your server will no longer be able to send an SYN/ACK reply. Any UDP based network communication however will still be received; however your system will no longer send any response to the originating IP.\n\nWhile iptables can accept tens of thousands of rules in a chain, the chains are walked sequentially until a match is found on every packet. So, lots of rules can lead to the system spending amazing amounts of CPU time walking through the rules.\n\nThe routing rules are much simpler than iptables. With iptables, a match can be based on many different variables including protocols, source and destination packets, and even other packets that were sent before the current packet.\n\nIn routing, all that matters is the remote IP address, so it\'s very easy to optimize. Also, many systems have a lot of routing rules. A typical system may only have 5 or 10, but something that\'s acting as a BGP router can have tens of thousands. So, for a very long time there have been extensive optimizations in selecting the right route for a particular packet.\n\nIn less technical terms this means your system will receive data from the attackers but no longer respond to it.\n\n```bash\nip route add blackhole 192.168.200.0/24\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nip route add 192.168.200.0/24 via 127.0.0.1\n```\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [The difference between iptables DROP and null-routing.](https://www.tummy.com/blogs/2006/07/27/the-difference-between-iptables-drop-and-null-routing/)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>How to run <code>scp</code> with a second remote host?</b></summary><br>\n\nWith `ssh`:\n\n```bash\nssh user1@remote1 \'ssh user2@remote2 "cat file"\' > file\n```\n\nWith `tar` (with compression):\n\n```bash\nssh user1@remote1 \'ssh user2@remote2 "cd path2; tar cj file"\' | tar xj\n```\n\nWith `ssh` and port forwarding tunnel:\n\n```bash\n# First, open the tunnel\nssh -L 1234:remote2:22 -p 45678 user1@remote1\n\n# Then, use the tunnel to copy the file directly from remote2\nscp -P 1234 user2@localhost:file .\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>How can you reduce load time of a dynamic website?</b></summary><br>\n\n- webpage optimization\n- cached web pages\n- quality web hosting\n- compressed text files\n- apache/nginx tuning\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>What types of dns cache working when you type api.example.com in your browser and press return?</b></summary><br>\n\nBrowser checks if the domain is in its cache (to see the DNS Cache in Chrome, go to `chrome://net-internals/#dns`).

So this is what I recommend. Run program first:\n\n```bash\nvalgrind --tool=callgrind --dump-instr=yes -v --instr-atstart=no ./binary > tmp\n```\n\nNow when it works and we want to start profiling we should run in another window:\n\n```bash\ncallgrind_control -i on\n```\n\nThis turns profiling on. To turn it off and stop whole task we might use:\n\n```bash\ncallgrind_control -k\n```\n\nNow we have some files named callgrind.out.* in current directory. To see profiling results use:\n\n```bash\nkcachegrind callgrind.out.*\n```\n\nI recommend in next window to click on **Self** column header, otherwise it shows that `main()` is most time consuming task.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Tracing processes for fun and profit](http://techblog.rosedu.org/tracing-processes-for-fun-and-profit.html)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using a Linux system with a limited number of packages installed, and telnet is not available.

This can contain a hacker even after they break in to a machine.\n\nAs an example, a hacker breaking into a system using a zero-day exploit of the Apache webserver service is highly likely to be limited to just the system memory and file resources that can be accessed by that process. The hacker would be able to download your html and php source files, and probably look into your mysql database, but they should not be able to get root or extend their intrusion beyond apache-accessible files.\n\nMany default Apache webserver installations create the \'apache\' user and group by default and you can easily configure the main Apache configuration file (`httpd.conf`) to run apache using those groups.\n\n2) **The principle of separation of privileges**\n\nIf your web site only needs read-only access to the database, then create an account that only has read-only permissions, and only to that database.\n\n**SElinux** is a good choice for creating context for security, `app-armor` is another tool. **Bastille** was a previous choice for hardening.\n\nReduce the consequence of any attack, by separating the power of the service that has been compromised into it own "Box".\n\n3) **Whitelist, don\'t blacklist**\n\nYou\'re describing a blacklist approach. A whitelist approach would be much safer.\n\nAn exclusive club will never try to list everyone who can\'t come in; they will list everyone who can come in and exclude those not on the list.\n\nSimilarly, trying to list everything that shouldn\'t access a machine is doomed. Restricting access to a short list of programs/IP addresses/users would be more effective.\n\nOf course, like anything else, this involves some trade-offs. Specifically, a whitelist is massively inconvenient and requires constant maintenance.\n\nTo go even further in the tradeoff, you can get great security by disconnecting the machine from the network.\n\n**Also interesting are**:\n\nUse the tools available. It\'s highly unlikely that you can do as well as the guys who are security experts, so use their talents to protect yourself.\n\n- public key encryption provides excellent security\n- enforce password complexity\n- understand why you are making exceptions to the rules above - review your exceptions regularly\n- hold someone to account for failure, it keeps you on your toes\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [How to prevent zero day attacks (original)](https://serverfault.com/questions/391370/how-to-prevent-zero-day-attacks)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>You\'re on a security conference.

Since there is no link to the file, you cannot open it by name. There is no facility to open a file by inode either.\n\nLinux exposes open files through special symbolic links under `/proc`. These links are called `/proc/12345/fd/42` where 12345 is the **PID** of a process and 42 is the number of a file descriptor in that process. A program running as the same user as that process can access the file (the read/write/execute permissions are the same you had as when the file was deleted).\n\nThe name under which the file was opened is still visible in the target of the symbolic link: if the file was `/var/log/apache/foo.log`, then the target of the link is `/var/log/apache/foo.log (deleted)`.\n\nThus you can recover the content of an open deleted file given the **PID** of a process that has it open and the descriptor that it\'s opened on like this:\n\n```bash\nrecover_open_deleted_file () {\n  old_name=$(readlink "$1")\n  case "$old_name" in\n    *\' (deleted)\')\n      old_name=${old_name%\' (deleted)\'}\n      if [ -e "$old_name" ]; then\n        new_name=$(TMPDIR=${old_name%/*} mktemp)\n        echo "$oldname has been replaced, recovering content to $new_name"\n      else\n        new_name="$old_name"\n      fi\n      cat <"$1" >"$new_name";;\n    *) echo "File is not deleted, doing nothing";;\n  esac\n}\nrecover_open_deleted_file "/proc/$pid/fd/$fd"\n```\n\nIf you only know the process **ID** but not the descriptor, you can recover all files with:\n\n```bash\nfor x in /proc/$pid/fd/* ; do\n  recover_open_deleted_file "$x"\ndone\n```\n\nIf you don\'t know the process **ID** either, you can search among all processes:\n\n```bash\nfor x in /proc/[1-9]*/fd/* ; do\n  case $(readlink "$x") in\n    /var/log/apache/*) recover_open_deleted_file "$x";;\n  esac\ndone\n```\n\nYou can also obtain this list by parsing the output of `lsof`, but it isn\'t simpler nor more reliable nor more portable (this is Linux-specific anyhow).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>The team of admins needs your support.

Unmount `proc`, `sys`, `dev` and `dev/pts` filesystems.\n\n```bash\ncd\ngrep $_working_directory /proc/mounts | cut -f2 -d " " | sort -r | xargs umount -n\n```\n\nNone of the available commands, i.e. `halt`, `shutdown` or `reboot`, will work. You need to reload the system configuration - to do this, use the **kernel debugger** (without the \'**b**\' option):\n\n```bash\necho 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq\necho reisu > /proc/sysrq-trigger\n```\n\nOf course, it is recommended to fully restart the machine in order to completely load the current system. To do this:\n\n```bash\nsync ; reboot -f\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Rsync triggered Linux OOM killer on a single 50 GB file. How does the OOM killer decide which process to kill first? How to control this?</b></summary><br>\n\nMajor distribution kernels set the default value of `/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory` to zero, which means that processes can request more memory than is currently free in the system.\n\nIf memory is exhaustively used up by processes, to the extent which can possibly threaten the stability of the system, then the **OOM killer** comes into the picture.\n\nNOTE: It is the task of the **OOM Killer** to continue killing processes until enough memory is freed for the smooth functioning of the rest of the process that the Kernel is attempting to run.\n\nThe **OOM Killer** has to select the best process(es) to kill. Best here refers to that process which will free up the maximum memory upon killing and is also the least important to the system.\n\nThe primary goal is to kill the least number of processes that minimizes the damage done and at the same time maximizing the amount of memory freed.\n\nTo facilitate this, the kernel maintains an `oom_score` for each of the processes. You can see the oom_score of each of the processes in the `/proc` filesystem under the pid directory.\n\n  > When analyzing OOM killer logs, it is important to look at what triggered it.\n\n```bash\ncat /proc/10292/oom_score\n```\n\nThe higher the value of `oom_score` of any process, the higher is its likelihood of getting killed by the **OOM Killer** in an out-of-memory situation.\n\nIf you want to create a special control group containing the list of processes which should be the first to receive the **OOM killer\'s** attention, create a directory under `/mnt/oom-killer` to represent it:\n\n```bash\nmkdir lambs\n```\n\nSet `oom.priority` to a value high enough:\n\n```bash\necho 256 > /mnt/oom-killer/lambs/oom.priority\n```\n\n`oom.priority` is a 64-bit unsigned integer, and can have a maximum value an unsigned 64-bit number can hold. While scanning for the process to be killed, the **OOM-killer** selects a process from the list of tasks with the highest `oom.priority` value.\n\nAdd the PID of the process to be added to the list of tasks:\n\n```bash\necho <pid> > /mnt/oom-killer/lambs/tasks\n```\n\nTo create a list of processes, which will not be killed by the **OOM-killer**, make a directory to contain the processes:\n\n```bash\nmkdir invincibles\n```\n\nSetting `oom.priority` to zero makes all the process in this cgroup to be excluded from the list of target processes to be killed.\n\n```bash\necho 0 > /mnt/oom-killer/invincibles/oom.priority\n```\n\nTo add more processes to this group, add the pid of the task to the list of tasks in the invincible group:\n\n```bash\necho <pid> > /mnt/oom-killer/invincibles/tasks\n```\n\nUseful resources:\n\n- [Rsync triggered Linux OOM killer on a single 50 GB file](https://serverfault.com/questions/724469/rsync-triggered-linux-oom-killer-on-a-single-50-gb-file)\n- [Taming the OOM killer](https://lwn.net/Articles/317814/)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>You have a lot of sockets, hanging in <code>TIME_WAIT</code>.
