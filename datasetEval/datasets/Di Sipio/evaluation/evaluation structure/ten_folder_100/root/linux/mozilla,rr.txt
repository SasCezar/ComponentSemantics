b'# Overview\n\nrr is a lightweight tool for recording, replaying and debugging execution of applications (trees of processes and threads).\nDebugging extends gdb with very efficient reverse-execution, which in combination with standard gdb/x86 features like hardware data watchpoints, makes debugging much more fun. More information about the project, including instructions on how to install, run, and build rr, is at [https://rr-project.org](https://rr-project.org). The best technical overview is currently the paper [Engineering Record And Replay For Deployability: Extended Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05937.pdf).\n\nOr go directly to the [installation and building instructions](https://github.com/mozilla/rr/wiki/Building-And-Installing).\n\nPlease contribute!  Make sure to review the [pull request checklist](/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.\n\nIf you find rr useful, please [add a testimonial](https://github.com/mozilla/rr/wiki/Testimonials).\n\n# System requirements\n\n* Linux kernel \xe2\x89\xa5 3.11 is required (for `PTRACE_SETSIGMASK`).\n* rr currently requires an Intel CPU with [Nehalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_%28microarchitecture%29) (2010) or later microarchitecture.\n* Running in a VM guest is supported, as long as the VM supports virtualization of hardware performance counters. (VMware and KVM are known to work; Xen does not.)\n'
