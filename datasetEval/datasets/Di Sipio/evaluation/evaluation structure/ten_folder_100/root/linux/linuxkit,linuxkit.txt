b"# LinuxKit\n\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/linuxkit/linuxkit.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/linuxkit/linuxkit)\n\nLinuxKit, a toolkit for building custom minimal, immutable Linux distributions.\n\n- Secure defaults without compromising usability\n- Everything is replaceable and customisable\n- Immutable infrastructure applied to building Linux distributions\n- Completely stateless, but persistent storage can be attached\n- Easy tooling, with easy iteration\n- Built with containers, for running containers\n- Designed to create [reproducible builds](./docs/reproducible-builds.md) [WIP]\n- Designed for building and running clustered applications, including but not limited to container orchestration such as Docker or Kubernetes\n- Designed from the experience of building Docker Editions, but redesigned as a general-purpose toolkit\n- Designed to be managed by external tooling, such as [Infrakit](https://github.com/docker/infrakit) or similar tools\n- Includes a set of longer-term collaborative projects in various stages of development to innovate on kernel and userspace changes, particularly around security\n\nLinuxKit currently supports the `x86_64`, `arm64`, and `s390x` architectures on a variety of platforms, both as virtual machines and baremetal (see [below](#booting-and-testing) for details).\n\n## Subprojects\n\n- [LinuxKit kubernetes](https://github.com/linuxkit/kubernetes) aims to build minimal and immutable Kubernetes images. (previously `projects/kubernetes` in this repository).\n- [LinuxKit LCOW](https://github.com/linuxkit/lcow) LinuxKit images and utilities for Microsoft's Linux Containers on Windows.\n- [linux](https://github.com/linuxkit/linux) A copy of the Linux stable tree with branches LinuxKit kernels.\n- [virtsock](https://github.com/linuxkit/virtsock) A `go` library and test utilities for `virtio` and Hyper-V sockets.\n- [rtf](https://github.com/linuxkit/rtf) A regression test framework used for the LinuxKit CI tests (and other projects).\n- [homebrew](https://github.com/linuxkit/homebrew-linuxkit) Homebrew packages for the `linuxkit` tool.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Build the `linuxkit` tool\n\nLinuxKit uses the `linuxkit` tool for building, pushing and running VM images.\n\nSimple build instructions: use `make` to build. This will build the tool in `bin/`. Add this\nto your `PATH` or copy it to somewhere in your `PATH` eg `sudo cp bin/* /usr/local/bin/`. Or you can use `sudo make install`.\n\nIf you already have `go` installed you can use `go get -u github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/src/cmd/linuxkit` to install the `linuxkit` tool.\n\nOn MacOS there is a `brew tap` available. Detailed instructions are at [linuxkit/homebrew-linuxkit](https://github.com/linuxkit/homebrew-linuxkit),\nthe short summary is\n```\nbrew tap linuxkit/linuxkit\nbrew install --HEAD linuxkit\n```\n\nBuild requirements from source using a container\n- GNU `make`\n- Docker\n- optionally `qemu`\n\nFor a local build using `make local`\n- `go`\n- `make`\n- `go get -u golang.org/x/lint/golint`\n- `go get -u github.com/gordonklaus/ineffassign`\n\n### Building images\n\nOnce you have built the tool, use\n\n```\nlinuxkit build linuxkit.yml\n```\nto build the example configuration. You can also specify different output formats, eg `linuxkit build -format raw-bios linuxkit.yml` to\noutput a raw BIOS bootable disk image, or `linuxkit build -format iso-efi linuxkit.yml` to output an EFI bootable ISO image. See `linuxkit build -help` for more information.\n\n### Booting and Testing\n\nYou can use `linuxkit run <name>` or `linuxkit run <name>.<format>` to\nexecute the image you created with `linuxkit build <name>.yml`.  This\nwill use a suitable backend for your platform or you can choose one,\nfor example VMWare.  See `linuxkit run --help`.\n\nCurrently supported platforms are:\n- Local hypervisors\n  - [HyperKit (macOS)](docs/platform-hyperkit.md) `[x86_64]`\n  - [Hyper-V (Windows)](docs/platform-hyperv.md) `[x86_64]`\n  - [qemu (macOS, Linux, Windows)](docs/platform-qemu.md) `[x86_64, arm64, s390x]`\n  - [VMware (macOS, Windows)](docs/platform-vmware.md) `[x86_64]`\n- Cloud based platforms:\n  - [Amazon Web Services](docs/platform-aws.md) `[x86_64]`\n  - [Google Cloud](docs/platform-gcp.md) `[x86_64]`\n  - [Microsoft Azure](docs/platform-azure.md) `[x86_64]`\n  - [OpenStack](docs/platform-openstack.md) `[x86_64]`\n  - [Scaleway](docs/platform-scaleway.md) `[x86_64]`\n- Baremetal:\n  - [packet.net](docs/platform-packet.md) `[x86_64, arm64]`\n  - [Raspberry Pi Model 3b](docs/platform-rpi3.md)  `[arm64]`\n\n\n#### Running the Tests\n\nThe test suite uses [`rtf`](https://github.com/linuxkit/rtf) To\ninstall this you should use `make bin/rtf && make install`. You will\nalso need to install `expect` on your system as some tests use it.\n\nTo run the test suite:\n\n```\ncd test\nrtf -v run -x\n```\n\nThis will run the tests and put the results in a the `_results` directory!\n\nRun control is handled using labels and with pattern matching.\nTo run add a label you may use:\n\n```\nrtf -v -l slow run -x\n```\n\nTo run tests that match the pattern `linuxkit.examples` you would use the following command:\n\n```\nrtf -v run -x linuxkit.examples\n```\n\n## Building your own customised image\n\nTo customise, copy or modify the [`linuxkit.yml`](linuxkit.yml) to your own `file.yml` or use one of the [examples](examples/) and then run `linuxkit build file.yml` to\ngenerate its specified output. You can run the output with `linuxkit run file`.\n\nThe yaml file specifies a kernel and base init system, a set of containers that are built into the generated image and started at boot time. You can specify the type\nof artifact to build eg `linuxkit build -format vhd linuxkit.yml`.\n\nIf you want to build your own packages, see this [document](docs/packages.md).\n\n### Yaml Specification\n\nThe yaml format specifies the image to be built:\n\n- `kernel` specifies a kernel Docker image, containing a kernel and a filesystem tarball, eg containing modules. The example kernels are built from `kernel/`\n- `init` is the base `init` process Docker image, which is unpacked as the base system, containing `init`, `containerd`, `runc` and a few tools. Built from `pkg/init/`\n- `onboot` are the system containers, executed sequentially in order. They should terminate quickly when done.\n- `services` is the system services, which normally run for the whole time the system is up\n- `files` are additional files to add to the image\n\nFor a more detailed overview of the options see [yaml documentation](docs/yaml.md)\n\n## Architecture and security\n\nThere is an [overview of the architecture](docs/architecture.md) covering how the system works.\n\nThere is an [overview of the security considerations and direction](docs/security.md) covering the security design of the system.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThis project was extensively reworked from the code we are shipping in Docker Editions, and the result is not yet production quality. The plan is to return to production\nquality during Q3 2017, and rebase the Docker Editions on this open source project during this quarter. We plan to start making stable releases on this timescale.\n\nThis is an open project without fixed judgements, open to the community to set the direction. The guiding principles are:\n- Security informs design\n- Infrastructure as code: immutable, manageable with code\n- Sensible, secure, and well-tested defaults\n- An open, pluggable platform for diverse use cases\n- Easy to use and participate in the project\n- Built with containers, for portability and reproducibility\n- Run with system containers, for isolation and extensibility\n- A base for robust products\n\n## Development reports\n\nThere are monthly [development reports](reports/) summarising the work carried out each month.\n\n## Adopters\n\nWe maintain an incomplete list of [adopters](ADOPTERS.md). Please open a PR if you are using LinuxKit in production or in your project, or both.\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee [FAQ](docs/faq.md).\n\nReleased under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).\n"
