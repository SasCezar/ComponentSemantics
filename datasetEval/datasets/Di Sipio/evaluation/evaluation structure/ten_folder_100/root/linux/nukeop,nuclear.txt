Imagine Spotify which you don't have to pay for and with a bigger library.\n\n## Pre-alpha release\nThe current version is a pre-alpha early access. Some of it is usable, some of it isn't. If there are things that don't work as expected or are counterintuitive, please open an issue so I can prioritize working on them.\n\n## What if I am religiously opposed to Electron?\nSee [this](docs/electron.md).\n\n## Features\n\n- Searching for and playing music from YouTube (including integration with playlists), Jamendo, and SoundCloud\n- Searching for albums (powered by Last.fm and MusicBrainz), album view, automatic song lookup based on artist and track name (in progress, can be dodgy sometimes)\n- Song queue, which can be exported as a playlist\n- Loading saved playlists (stored in json files)\n- Scrobbling to last.fm (along with updating the 'now playing' status)\n- Newest releases with reviews - tracks and albums\n- Browsing by genre\n- Radio mode (automatically queue similar tracks)\n- Unlimited downloads (powered by youtube)\n- Realtime lyrics\n- Browsing by popularity\n- List of favorite tracks\n- Listening from local library\n\n## Manual and docs\nhttps://nuclearmusic.rtfd.io/\n\n## Community-maintained packages\n\nHere's a list of packages maintained by third parties.

You need to allow the root user to connect to X11 display, and then you can run docker-compose:\n\n```shell\n$ xhost SI:localuser:root\n$ sudo docker-compose up dev\n```\n\nA new window should open that will load the web app and run Nuclear.\nOn non-Linux systems, you can use lerna:\n```shell\n$ npm i -g lerna #installs lerna globally\n$ lerna bootstrap\n$ lerna run start\n```\n\n---\nTo build for current operating system:\n```bash\n$ npm run build\n```\n\nInstead of `build` you can use `build:all` to build for all operating systems. The binaries will be in `packages/app/release`\n\nIn case of errors with dbus/mpris, try removing optional dependencies from `packages/app/package.json` and node_modules.\n\n## License\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n"
