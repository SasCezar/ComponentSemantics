b'# [Notable](https://notable.md)\n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://img.notable.md/screenshot-main.png">\n    <img src="https://notable.md/static/images/screenshots/main_mac.png" width="900" alt="Notable">\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://download.notable.md">\n    <img src="https://notable.md/static/images/badges/download.png" height="42" alt="Download button" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n---\n\nI couldn\'t find a note-taking app that ticked all the boxes I\'m interested in: notes are written and rendered in GitHub Flavored Markdown, no WYSIWYG, no proprietary formats, I can run a search & replace across all notes, notes support attachments, the app isn\'t bloated, the app has a pretty interface, tags are indefinitely nestable and can import Evernote notes (because that\'s what I was using before).\n\nSo I built my own.\n\n## [Comparison](https://notable.md/static/images/comparison.png)\n\n[![Click to Enlarge](https://notable.md/static/images/comparison.png)](https://notable.md/static/images/comparison.png)\n\nPart of this comparison is personal opinion: you may disagree on the UI front, things I consider bloat may be considered features by somebody else etc. but hopefully this comparison did a good job at illustrating the main differences.\n\n## Features\n\n### Markdown-based\n\nNotes are written in GitHub Flavored Markdown, and you can also write [KaTeX](https://katex.org) expressions, [Mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) diagrams and so much more, check out our full [Markdown cheatsheet](https://cheatsheet.notable.md).\n\nNotable also gives you a very powerful Markdown editor, it\'s the same one VS Code uses in fact, so features like multi-cursors, a minimap and best-in-class syntax highlighting are built-in.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://img.notable.md/screenshot-editor.png">\n    <img src="https://notable.md/static/images/screenshots/editor_mac.png" width="800" alt="Editor" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n### No Vendor Lock-In\n\nNotes and attachments are simply stored on your disk, this is extremely portable and powerful: you could edit your notes with your favorite editor, have them synchronized via Dropbox, run Git on them, run a regex-based search and replace on them etc.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://img.notable.md/screenshot-filesystem.png">\n    <img src="https://notable.md/static/images/screenshots/filesystem_mac.png" width="800" alt="Filesystem" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n### Dark Theme\n\nA dark theme is also available. In the future support for [custom themes](https://github.com/notable/notable/issues/104) will be added as well.\n\nIf you\'d like to change a color or hide a button you are also free to do that via the Devtools.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://img.notable.md/screenshot-dark.png">\n    <img src="https://notable.md/static/images/screenshots/dark_mac.png" width="800" alt="Dark Theme" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n### Zen Mode\n\nZen mode provides a minimalistic editing and reading experience, hiding everything that\'s not necessary.\n\nNotable is also keyboard friendly, has a [quick open](https://img.notable.md/screenshot-dark.png) window, and we\'ll soon add a [command palette](https://github.com/notable/notable/issues/338) too, so you won\'t have to click any buttons if you don\'t want to.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://img.notable.md/screenshot-zen.png">\n    <img src="https://notable.md/static/images/screenshots/zen_mac.png" width="800" alt="Zen Mode" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n### Multi-Note Editor\n\nA multi-note editor is available for quickly running an action, like favoriting, pinning, deleting, tagging etc., on multiple notes at once.\n\nIf you need to run a more complex action on your notes remember that they are just file stored on your disk so you can do whatever you want with them.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://img.notable.md/screenshot-multieditor.png">\n    <img src="https://notable.md/static/images/screenshots/multieditor_mac.png" width="800" alt="Multi-Note Editor" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n### Split Editor\n\nA split-editor is available for quickly checking out how your note will be rendered while you\'re editing it.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://img.notable.md/screenshot-spliteditor.png">\n    <img src="https://notable.md/static/images/screenshots/spliteditor_mac.png" width="800" alt="Split Editor" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n## More Features\n\nA lot more features are implemented, some of the most important ones are listed [here](https://notable.md/#more-features).\n\nIs a feature you care about currently missing?
