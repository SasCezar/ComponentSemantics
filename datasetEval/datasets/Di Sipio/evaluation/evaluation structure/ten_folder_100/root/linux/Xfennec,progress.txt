b'progress - Coreutils Progress Viewer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Xfennec/progress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Xfennec/progress)\n=====================\n\nWhat is it?\n-----------\n\nThis tool can be described as a **Tiny**, Dirty, Linux-and-OSX-Only C command\nthat looks for coreutils basic commands (cp, mv, dd, tar, gzip/gunzip,\ncat, etc.) currently running on your system and displays the\n**percentage** of copied data. It can also show **estimated time** and **throughput**,\nand provides a "top-like" mode (monitoring).\n\n![progress screenshot with cp and mv](https://raw.github.com/Xfennec/progress/master/capture.png)\n\n_(After many requests: the colors in the shell come from [powerline-shell](https://github.com/milkbikis/powerline-shell). Try it, it\'s cool.)_\n\nFormerly known as cv (Coreutils Viewer).\n\nHow do you build it?\n--------------------\n\n    make && make install\n\nIt depends on library ncurses, you may have to install corresponding packages (may be something like \'libncurses5-dev\' or \'ncurses-devel\').\n\nHow do you run it?\n------------------\n\nJust launch the binary, `progress`.\n\n\nWhat can I do with it?\n----------------------\n\nA few examples. You can:\n\n* monitor all current and upcoming instances of coreutils commands in\n  a simple window:\n\n        watch progress -q\n\n* see how your download is progressing:\n\n        watch progress -wc firefox\n\n* look at your Web server activity:\n\n        progress -c httpd\n\n* launch and monitor any heavy command using `$!`:\n\n        cp bigfile newfile & progress -mp $!\n\nand much more.\n\nHow does it work?\n-----------------\n\nIt simply scans `/proc` for interesting commands, and then looks at\ndirectories `fd` and `fdinfo` to find opened files and seek positions,\nand reports status for the largest file.\n\nIt\'s very light, and compatible with virtually any command.\n'
