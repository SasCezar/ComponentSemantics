b"Steam for Linux Client\n======================\n\nThis is the README for the Steam for Linux client.\n\nHardware and Software Requirements\n----------------------------------\nSteam for Linux requires the following:\n\n- 1 GHz Pentium 4 or AMD Opteron with 512 megabytes of RAM and 5 gigabytes of hard drive space, or better\n- Internet connection (Cable/DSL speeds recommended)\n- Latest Ubuntu LTS, fully updated\n- Latest graphics driver\n- NVidia driver support - For recent cards (e.g. series 8), you will need to install 310.x. For older cards, driver 304.x supports the NVidia 6 and 7 GPU series. To access these drivers, first update your\xc2\xa0cache\xc2\xa0and then install the specific\xc2\xa0[driver](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8509-RFXM-1964)\xc2\xa0you need from the list in Additional Drivers.\n- AMD driver support - For recent cards (e.g. series 5 and above), we recommend installing the 12.11 driver. For older cards, Catalyst 13.1 Legacy supports the HD 2400 Pro card and is the latest for the 2 and 4 GPU series.\n- Intel HD 3000/4000 driver support - you will need to use the latest Mesa drivers, Mesa 9 or later. For installation instructions, see\xc2\xa0[here](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Valve).\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\nInstall Steam for Linux client:\n\n1. Download the `steam_latest.deb` package from this [location](http://media.steampowered.com/client/installer/steam.deb).\n2. Open a graphical file manager (for Ubuntu 12.04, click the folder icon on the\xc2\xa0Unity Launch\xc2\xa0bar).\n3. Navigate to the directory containing `steam_latest.deb` and double-click it. This launches Ubuntu Software Center\xc2\xa0and installs the package.\n4. If you prefer to install from the command-line, use gdebi. Install the\xc2\xa0`gdebi-core` package\xc2\xa0(`apt-get install gdebi-core`) and then install the Steam for Linux package (`gdebi steam_latest.deb`).\n5. For a list of games supported by Steam for Linux either visit this\xc2\xa0[page](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8495-OKZC-0159)\xc2\xa0or click\xc2\xa0Store (from the client) and then the\xc2\xa0Linux\xc2\xa0tab on the far-right.\nWe recommend that you join the Steam for Linux official game group, located\xc2\xa0[here](http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410). You will find future beta announcements and other information posted here as well as an active discussion forum.\n\nReporting Issues\n----------------\n\nIf you encounter an issue with Steam for Linux, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.\n\nFor issues with:\n\n* Source-based games (HL2:DM, HL2, HL2:EP1, HL2:EP2, TF2, DoD:S, CS:S), visit our [Source Issue List](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues)\n* GoldSrc-based games (HL, HL:BS, HL:OF, TFC, DoD, DMC, CS, CS:CZ or Ricochet), visit our [Half-Life Issue List](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/issues)\n* Portal 2, visit our [Portal 2 Issue List](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/portal2/issues)\n* CS:GO, visit our [CS:GO Issue List](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues)\n* Games using Proton, visit our [Proton Issue List](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues)\n\nIf it has not been reported, create a new issue with the following information:\n\n- a short, descriptive title;\n- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;\n- steps for reproducing the issue; and\n- your system information.\\*\n\nPlease place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).\n\n\\* The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`). Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`. Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block.\n\nConduct\n-------\n\n\nThere are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:\n\n- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.\n- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.\n- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.\n- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.\n\nRemember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Steam. Also, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested. Patience is always appreciated.\n"
