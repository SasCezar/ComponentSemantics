Due to the limited sources of information we only have identified vulnerabilities for the ones listed in [yavdb](https://github.com/rtfpessoa/yavdb#yet-another-vulnerability-database).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis projects aims to provide an OSS alternative to identify known vulnerabilities for your dependencies.\nAlthough it makes a good effort in doing this, there is no assurance it is finding all the publicly available vulnerabilities.\nThe maintainers take no responsibility for any harm caused by you relying on it.\nUse as a complement to other tools at your own risk.  \n\n## Supported Package Managers\n\n* NPM\n* RubyGems\n* Maven\n* Nuget\n* Packagist\n* Pypi\n* Go\n* Cargo\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Ruby 2.3 or newer\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\ngem install dependency_spy\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Examples\n\n**Check current directory project**\n```\ndepspy\n```\n\n## TODO:\n\n#### Tests\n\n- [ ] Version Comparison\n\n#### Features/Improvements\n\n- [ ] Ignore vulnerabilities\n- [ ] Improve output formatters\n- [ ] Add more output options\n\n### Help\n\n    Commands:\n      depspy check           # Check dependencies for known vulnerabilities\n      depspy help [COMMAND]  # Describe available commands or one specific command\n      depspy update          # Update known vulnerabilities database\n    \n    Options:\n      [--verbose], [--no-verbose]   \n      d, [--vuln-db-path=VULN-DB-PATH]  # Default: <HOME>/.yavdb/yavdb\n\n\n## Development\n\nAfter checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.\nThen, run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests.\nYou can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.\n\nTo install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.\nTo release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`,\nwhich will create a git tag for the version,\npush git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).\n\n## Contributing\n\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/rtfpessoa/dependency_spy.\nThis project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration,\nand contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright (c) 2017-present Rodrigo Fernandes.\nSee [LICENSE](https://github.com/rtfpessoa/dependency_spy/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.\n'
