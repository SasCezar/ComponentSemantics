Afterwards you can create an appropriate pull request.\n\nIt is required if you want to get a Pull request to be integrated into please\nsquash your commits into a single commit which references the issue in the\ncommit message which looks like this:\n\n```\nFixed #Issue\n o Description.\n```\n\nThis makes it simpler to merge it and this will also close the\nappropriate issue automatically in one go. This make the life as \nmaintainer a little bit easier.\n\nA pull request has to fulfill only a single ticket and should never\ncreate/add/fix several issues in one, cause otherwise the history is hard to\nread and to understand and makes the maintenance of the issues and pull request\nhard or to be honest impossible.\n\nFurthermore it is necessary to create appropriate entries into the `ReleaseNotes.md`\nfile as well.\n\n\n## Releasing\n\n* Make sure `gpg-agent` is running.\n* Execute `mvn -B release:prepare release:perform`\n\nFor publishing the site do the following:\n\n```\ncd target/checkout\nmvn verify site site:stage scm-publish:publish-scm\n```\n'
