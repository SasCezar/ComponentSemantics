A set of destinations compose an app\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnavigation graph.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n### Principles:\n* Focuses on the Activity being an entry point and container, whereas fragments take the center stage for content and navigation between screens.\n* Abstraction layer for navigation, performs Activity transitions, Fragment Transactions and back stack maintenance seamlessly for you.\n* Declaring your Navigation graph ahead-of-time so that the system can understand it and execute Navigational code for you.\n\n### Requirements:\n* Android Studio 3.2 - Canary 14+\n\n### Implementation:\n* Create a navigation graph (looks like a Wireframe) within XML / Code and link screens with each other (both forward and backward linking if needed)\n* Use the NavigationController either\n    * Set a view\'s onClickListener with Navigation.createNavigateOnClickListener(nextScreenId, args) for navigating when clicked\n    * At the point of navigation, after business logic, call View.findNavController().navigate(R.id.nextScreenId)\n\n### Bonus: Interoperability\n* Hooks up with BottomNavigationView, Toolbar and other top-level navigational views for back navigation, selections and automagic transitions when specifying destinations in Menu resource files.\n* Hooks up directly with the Manifest Merger so that all Deeplinks / Intent Filters for a given Activity are populated in the Manifest at build time.\n* Easier testability of navigational logic since NavigationController can be tested in isolation.\n\n### Bonus: Safe Args\n* Compile-time checking for Navigation arguments to simplify argument passing between Navigation components.\n* Ability to specify argument types and default values if some args are optional.\n* Internally creates classes to fetch arguments and exposes them as properties via ClassNameArgs.fromBundle(arguments)\n\n#### Codelab\n* [Navigation Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-navigation/index.html#0)\n\n#### Article\n* [Exploring Android\'s Navigation Architecture Component - Nish Tahir](https://willowtreeapps.com/ideas/exploring-androids-navigation-architecture-component)\n\n\n## Paging\n### [Webpage](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE5bsyGGLf4)\n\n*The Paging Library makes it easier for you to load data gradually and gracefully within your app\'s RecyclerView.*\n\n* Allows you to **paginate local results** with [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html) database.\n* Also allows you to **paginate web requests** with [Retrofit](square.github.io/retrofit/)\n\n### Code Sample (Non-reactive):\n```kotlin\n/* In Dao */\n@Query("SELECT * FROM users")\nfun allUsers(): Datasource.Factory<Int,User>\n\n/* In ViewModel */\ninit{\n    val factory: Datasource.Factory = database.allUsersFactory()\n    users = LivePagedListBuilder(factory,30).build() //where 30 is the amount of items to load in one page\n}\nval users: Live<PagedList<User>> = userDao.allUsers()\n\n/* In Activity / Fragment */\nval adapter = MyAdapter()\nviewmodel.users.observe(this){\n    adapter.submitList(it)\n}\n\n/* In Adapter */\nclass MyAdapter():PagedListAdapter<User, UserViewHolder>(\n    object: DiffUtil.ItemCallback<User>(){\n        //Override areItemsTheSame and areContentsTheSame\n}\n){\n    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: UserViewHolder, position: Int){\n        val user : User? = getItem(position) //User is now nullable\n    }   \n}\n```\n\n* [PagedList.Config](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/paging/PagedList.Config) can be used to override the page-size ( amount of items to load in one page), initial load size (amount of items to load on the first page), prefetch distance (prefetch distance which defines how far ahead to load) and enable place holders(display null placeholders)\n* Placeholders when enabled, send nulls to the adapter when data is yet to be successfully pulled and can be rendered to show loading to the user.\n\n### Code Sample (Reactive):\n```kotlin\n/* In ViewModel */\n//Flowable or Observable\nval concertList: Flowable<PagedList<Concert>> = RxPagedListBuilder(\n        concertDao.concertsByDate(),\n        /* page size */ 50\n).buildFlowable(BackpressureStrategy.LATEST)\n\n/* In activity or fragment */\nviewModel.concertList.subscribe({flowableList -> \n    adapter.submitList(flowableList)\n})\n```\n### Datasources\n* [PositionalDataSource](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/paging/PositionalDataSource) - To be used when user can directly scroll to a particular position in the yet-to-be-loaded list. eg - Contacts app\n* [ItemKeyedDataSource](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/paging/ItemKeyedDataSource) - To be used when your data source holds some kind of ordered key which can help identify the next or previous item to a particular item.\n* [PageKeyedDataSource](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/paging/PageKeyedDataSource) - To be used when the data returned to be from the server is paginated as pages and the last element of each page points to the next page.\n\n### Network Pagination\n* Consider your local cache (database) as the source of truth.\n* Whenever you run out of data locally or optionally on first load, ping the server, handle results and insert to database, which in-turn updates the UI.\n* Use [BoundaryCallback](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/paging/PagedList.BoundaryCallback) to auto trigger network load when the local runs out of data\n\n#### Codelab\n* [Android Paging Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-paging/index.html)\n\n#### Samples\n* [googlesamples/android-architecture-components/PagingSample/](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/PagingSample)\n* [googlesamples/android-architecture-components/PagingWithNetworkSample/](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/PagingWithNetworkSample)\n\n\n## WorkManager\n### [Webpage](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrKoBFLwTN0)\n\n*The WorkManager API makes it easy to specify deferrable, asynchronous tasks and when they should run*\n\n* The jobs will be **guaranteed** to run in the range as well **constraints** specified.\n* Works in coordination with Doze mode.\n* **Does not require Google Play Services**\n* Can **chain jobs** to run sequentially based on previous results or parallely.\n* `doWork()` (responsible for performing the intended request) by-default **runs on the background thread**.\n* Work can be:\n    * [OneTimeWorkRequest](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/OneTimeWorkRequest) - Request for non-repeating work.\n    * [PeriodicWorkRequest](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/PeriodicWorkRequest) - Request for repeating work.\n*  [Constraints](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Constraints) can be around - Network, Battery, Idle and Storage on device\n*  Can observe the status of the work request as a `LiveData` of [WorkStatus](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/WorkStatus)\n*  In chaining, output of one or more jobs can become the input of another.\n*  A job can be cancelled by calling the `cancelWorkById(id)`\n*  A job can be attached a tag to make debugging easier using `addTag()` on WorkRequest.\n*  Tags can also be used cancel all the requests belonging to a particular tag.\n*  **Periodic work can be scheduled only after 15 mins**\n*  Periodic work cannot be chained.\n*  Under the hood delegates and uses\n    *  JobScheduler (API 23+)\n    *  Firebase JobDispatcher (if app includes Firebase JobDispatcher)\n    *  AlarmManager + Broadcast Receivers\n* Provides a `TestDriver` to test the work and run synchronously\n* Currently in `1.0.0-alpha01`\n* Has an **additional Kotlin extensions** library for Kotlin users\n\n#### Articles\n* [Exploring Jetpack: Scheduling tasks with Work Manager - Keval Patel](https://android.jlelse.eu/exploring-jetpack-scheduling-tasks-with-work-manager-fba20d7c69bf)\n* [Exploring Jetpack: The power of chains in the WorkManager APIs - Keval Patel](https://android.jlelse.eu/exploring-jetpack-the-power-of-chains-in-the-workmanager-apis-30509ca4b2c)\n\n#### Codelab\n* [Background Work with WorkManager](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-workmanager/index.html#0)\n\n\n## Slices\n### [Webpage](https://developer.android.com/guide/slices/) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7IVH5aNwwc)\n\n\n## App Bundle\n### [Webpage](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bViNOUeFuiQ)\n\n- An Android App Bundle is a new upload format that includes all your app\xe2\x80\x99s compiled code and resources, but defers APK generation and signing to Google Play.\n- It uses Google Play\xe2\x80\x99s new app serving model, called Dynamic Delivery. It will generate apk based on the user\'s device configuration  such as screen density, CPU architecture, locale etc. Your user downloads only resources required for his/her device.\n- There will be three apks: \n   - **Base APK:** This APK contains code and resources that all other split APKs can access and provides the basic functionality of your app. \n   - **Configuration APKs:** It includes resources for different screen density, CPU architecture, locale etc.\n   - **Dynamic feature APKs:** These are the APKs that are not required at the install time but it will be downloaded and installed in real-time when the feature is required. \n\n### Requirements:\n* Android Studio 3.2 - Canary 14+. Android Studio 3.2 provides an option to [configure your project for Dynamic Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/configure) while generating signed apk.\n* In order to use App Bundle feature, you must enroll in the [App Signing](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423?hl=en ) on Google Play console. \n\n#### Codelab\n* [Your First Android App Bundle](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-dynamic-app/index.html#0)\n\n\n## Android Design Tools\n### [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytZteMo4ETk)\n\n### Layout Editor\n* **Convert View** - Easily convert an existing ViewGroup into a `ConstraintLayout` or `LinearLayout` or `CoordinatorLayout` by right clicking on it in the Layout Editor.\n* **Navigate to included layout** - If you have an included layout, clicking on it in the editor will open its hierarchy there itself, instead of having to open it separately.\n\n### [Tools Attributes](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/tool-attributes) \n Additional information to Android Studio to display test content, apply test parameters during development. All parameters are ignored during run time. Ex: \n* `tools:listitem` : populate item\'s layout in a RecyclerView in the editor\n* `tools:itemCount` : populate X number of item\'s in a RecyclerView in the editor\n* `tools:showIn` : to show an included layout as it appears in the parent\n* `tools:text` : set a probable text to a TextView\n* `tools:textColor`  - set a probable color to a TextView \n\n### Sample Data\nIntroduced in AS 3.0. It helps you populate data which is not available at the same time. Each time a random value is picked from the sample space.\n* **Creation** - Right click on module > New > Sample Data Directory > Right Click on newly created  `sampledata` directory > New > File > {filename}  \n* Types supported are: Colors, Strings, Dimensions, Images &  Json\n* Predefined Sample data:\n    * Names: `@tools:sample/first_name`\n    * Cities: `@tools:sample/us_cities` \n    * Lorem Ipsum: `@tools:sample/lorem` \n    * Lorem Ipsum(x words): `@tools:sample/lorem[x]` \n    * Avatars: `@tools:sample/avatars` \n* Can select Sample Data resources from the **Resource Picker in AS**\n* In AS 3.2 you will be able to **override random selection and set one resource** to be picked each time.\n\n### ConstraintLayout\n### [Webpage](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout/)\n\n*ConstraintLayout allows you to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups).* Sometimes referred to as a **RelativeLayout on Steroids**.\n\n* ConstraintLayout 1.0 allowed: \n    * Relative Positioning\n    * Center and Bias  Positioning\n    * Group behavior (chains / weights)\n    * Visibility behavior\n    * Aspect Ratio\n    * ConstraintSet\n    * Guidelines\n* ConstraintLayout 1.1 added, in addition to others, `Barriers` - position an element relative to a set of elements.\n* ConstraintLayout 2.0 additions:\n    * Helpers - Elements that help you define constraints and design UIs but are not rendered on the screen at runtime. Ex - Guidelines. Categorized as:\n        * LayoutManipulation - help you build layouts\n        * Post-Layout Manipulation - fly in an element at first launch\n        * Rendering and decorating\n    * Layers\n    * Circular Reveal - Reveal the referenced layout elements in a circular fashion.\n    * Decorators - A put animations on your views. Like a Lava Decoration to reveal elements as blobs. Ex: \n        * Lava\n        * Bottom bar\n    * Constraint State - A separate XML file to define various states in which your constraints can animate.\n    * MotionLayout - A sub-class of ConstraintLayout to support smoother transitions\n\n#### Articles\n* [Android Tools attributes: listItem & sample data rocks! - Thibault de Lambilly](https://android.jlelse.eu/android-tools-attributes-listitem-sample-data-rocks-bbf49aaa9f07)\n\n#### Videos\n* [ConstraintLayout 2.0 sneak peek - Nicolas Roard & John Hoford](https://vimeo.com/265304656)\n\n#### Codelab\n* [Use ConstraintLayout to design your Android views](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/constraint-layout/)\n\n\n## Android Development Tools\n### [Video](https://youtu.be/WxAZk7A7OkM)\n\n### Android Studio 3.1\n- [D8](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/android-studio-switching-to-d8-dexer.html) with Desugar integrated lead to 16% increase in build speed on Android Studio 3.1.0\n- **SQL code editing** to allow code completion and project navigation on your SQL queries for Room and vanilla SQLite.\n- **Kotlin Lint checks** in the IDE and console\n- **C++ CPU profiler** to analyse performance impact of C++ code. \n- **Network Threading Profiler** to help analyse each thread in multi-threaded network calls.\n- **Emulator quick boot** launches the emulator in under 3 seconds\n\n### Android Studio 3.2\n- Supports Android P developer preview APIs\n- Supports Android App Bundle\n- **What\'s New Window** to inboard with new features, changes, etc.\n- Generate Signed APK now has new option to generate App Bundle\n- **Apk analyser** works on App Bundle files\n- Supports creation of **Dynamic modules** in the new module creation wizard\n- Profilers now breaks performance analysis into **sessions** to allow comparing of sessions\n- **CPU profiler** can be triggered from code using \n    ```java\n    Debug.startMethodTracking()\n    ```\n- **Network profiler** shows threads, requests and responses \n- Memory profiler shows JNI references.\n- The new **Energy profiler** helps monitor battery life\n- Emulator saves **snapshots** to load back into same states\n    - Screen Recording added\n- Adds **Google Sceneform tool** to support building of AR apps\n    - Also allows previewing 3D models inside AS\n-  Jetpack refactoring tools allows auto-migration to Android X in gradle and XML files\n-  Supports **[Navigation](#navigation)** Editor\n-  Supports **[Sample Data](#sample-data)** wizards\n-  Support will be added for  **ConstraintLayout motion** in the future\n-  Runs on Pixel Chromebook\n    -  No ADB yet\n- D8 is the default dexer and R8 is the new optimizer and shrinker to improve build speeds as well as replace Proguard\n\n\n## Android Things :traffic_light:\n\nAndroid Things is Google\'s platform to support the development of Internet of Things devices.
