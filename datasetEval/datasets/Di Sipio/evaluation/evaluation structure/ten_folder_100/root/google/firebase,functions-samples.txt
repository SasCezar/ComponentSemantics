[Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/features/functions) integrates the Firebase platform by letting you write code that responds to events and invokes functionality exposed by other Firebase features.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo learn how to get started with Cloud Functions for Firebase by having a look at our [Getting Started Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started), trying the [quickstart samples](/quickstarts) and looking at [the documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions).\n\n\n## Samples Overview\n\nThis repository contains a few categories of samples:\n\n 1. [**Quickstarts**](#quickstarts) are minimal examples for each types of triggers.\n 1. [**Development Environment Samples and Boilerplates**](#environment) illustrates how to get started with\ndifferent, commonly used JavaScript development patterns such as Typescript, React SSR, ES2017 etc...\n 1. [**Image Processing**](#image) shows a few ways where you can process and transform images using Cloud Functions such as generating thumbnails, converting images extracting metadata...\n 1. [**Firebase Realtime Database Data Consistency**](#rtdb) shows how to implement automatic data consistency such as keeping a count of children, having a max amount of node childs, cleaning up old data etc... for your Realtime Database.\n 1. [**Other common usecases**](#other) a set of other common usecases for Cloud Functions.\n\n\n<a name="quickstarts"></a>\n## Quickstarts\n\nHere is a set of minimal samples for each Cloud Functions trigger types.\n\n### Quickstart: Uppercaser for [Realtime Database](/quickstarts/uppercase) or [Cloud Firestore](/quickstarts/uppercase-firestore)\n\nThis quickstart sample demonstrates using **Cloud Functions** triggered by **Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore events**.
