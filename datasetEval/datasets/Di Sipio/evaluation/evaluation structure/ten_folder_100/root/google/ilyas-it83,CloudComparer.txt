The version 1 recieved more than 22K views and 400+ download at the time of working on this project. This gave me the idea of creating a robust and dependable comparison/mapping between the various services offered by the major cloud providers in a lively and updatable format.\n\nThe project is open sourced to let fellow Cloud Architects, IT Pros, Developers to feel free to edit and update the comparison upto date.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426) for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.\n\n## Authors\n\n* **Ilyas_IT83** - *Initial work* - [CloudComparer](https://github.com/ilyas-it83/CloudComparer/)\n\nSee also the list of [contributors](https://github.com/ilyas-it83/CloudComparer/graphs/contributors) who participated in this project.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details\n\n## Acknowledgments\n'
