b"# Welcome to Mobly\n\n**Mobly** is a Python-based test framework that specializes in supporting test\ncases that require multiple devices, complex environments, or custom hardware\nsetups.\n\nHere are some example use cases:\n*   P2P data transfer between two devices\n*   Conference calls across three phones\n*   Wearable device interacting with a phone\n*   Internet-Of-Things devices interacting with each other\n*   Testing RF characteristics of devices with special equipment\n*   Testing LTE network by controlling phones, base stations, and eNBs\n\nMobly can support many different types of devices and equipment, and it's easy\nto plug your own device or custom equipment/service into Mobly.\n\nMobly comes with a set of libs to control common devices like Android devices.\n\nWhile developed by Googlers, Mobly is not an official Google product.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMobly is compatible with both *python 3.4+* and *python 2.7*.\n\nNOTE: As part of the bigger [communitiy initiative](https://python3statement.org/),\nwe are planning to drop Python 2.7 support at the end of 2019.\n\nMobly tests could run on the following platforms:\n  - Ubuntu 14.04+\n  - MacOS 10.6+\n  - Windows 7+\n\n| Platform | Build Status |\n|----------|--------------|\n| Linux    | [![Linux Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/mobly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/mobly) |\n| Windows  | [![Windows Build Status](https://storage.googleapis.com/mobly-kokoro-build-badges/mobly-windows.svg)](https://fusion.corp.google.com/projectanalysis/current/KOKORO/prod%3Amobly%2Fgcp_windows%2Fcontinuous) |\n\n## System dependencies\n  - adb (1.0.36+ recommended)\n  - python2.7 or python3.4+\n  - python-setuptools\n\n*If you use Python3, use `pip3` and `python3` (or python3.x) accordingly.*\n\n## Installation\nYou can install the released package from pip\n\n```sh\npip install mobly\n```\n\nor download the source then run `setup.py` to use the bleeding edge:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/google/mobly.git\ncd mobly\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nYou may need `sudo` for the above commands if your system has certain permission\nrestrictions.\n\n## Tutorials\n\n* [Mobly 101](docs/tutorial.md) -\nSimple test examples to get you started with Mobly.\n\n* [Mobly Instrumentation Runner Tutorial](docs/instrumentation_tutorial.md) -\nHow to use Mobly's Android instrumentation test runner to run Android instrumentation tests.\n\n* [Mobly AndroidDevice Service](docs/android_device_service.md) -\nCreate custom service to attach to Mobly's `AndroidDevice` controller.\n\n## Mobly Snippet\nThe Mobly Snippet projects let users better control Android devices.\n\n* [Mobly Snippet Lib](https://github.com/google/mobly-snippet-lib): used for\ntriggering custom device-side code from host-side Mobly tests. You could use existing\nAndroid libraries like UI Automator and Espresso.\n* [Mobly Bundled Snippets](https://github.com/google/mobly-bundled-snippets): a set\nof Snippets to allow Mobly tests to control Android devices by exposing a simplified\nversion of the public Android API suitable for testing.\n"
