However, when we copy the PDF content and paste it into the webpage translation, there may be extra line breaks that lead to garbled translation, and the translation does not match the Chinese reading habits. The translation results are very poor and  you need to manually delete the line break, and `CopyTranslator` can help us solve this problem quickly and perfectly.\n\nJust open the `CopyTranslator` and copy the PDF text to clipboard,  `CopyTranslator` will watch the clipboard changes, then it will process the clipboard contents (such as removing extra line breaks, etc.) and display the translation results. The translation effect is greatly improved compared to the direct copy and paste to the web version of the translation, and the time required for translation is greatly reduced. With the powerful Google translation API, the translation quality is guaranteed. There are also a wealth of options you can set, such as automatically copy translation results to the clipboard, [Incremental Copy](#Incremental-Copy), [Smart Translation](#Smart-Translation), etc., it effectively improve people\'s reading and translation efficiency of foreign literature.\n\n**After several iterations, `CopyTranslator` has became more and more powerful as well as user-friendly. It is recommended to read the full [User Manual](https://copytranslator.github.io/guide/) to make best use of it**.\n\n### Core usage\n\n**Open a webpage/PDF, select the text to be translated, copy the text to the clipboard, `CopyTranslator` will listens to the clipboard change, and  process the clipboard content (such as removing extra line breaks, etc.), translate it, and display**.  Just copy the text,`CopyTranslator` will immediately give the translation result, effectively improving your work efficiency.**\n\n![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2018/11/30/FmrNFS.gif)\n\n## Features\n\n### Copy=Translate\n\n**Greatly simplify the steps required for translation**, just copy the text to the clipboard, and wait to view the translation results in the next second, enjoy the WYSIWYG pleasure, and we also have the [Tap to Copy](#tap-to-copyexperimental) mechanism , making it easier for you to copy text.\n\n### Solve the problem of PDF copy translation\n\n`CopyTranslator` is specifically optimized for English and Chinese pdf line breaks and sentence endings, basically solving the problem caused by extra sentence breaks and line breaks. The following figure shows the translation results using `CopyTranslator`. It\'s obvious that the translation effect is greatly improved compared to directly copy and paste to the online translator. At the same time, with the powerful google translation API, the translation quality is guaranteed, and the translation.google.cn used is also faster to connect, no need to worry about network problems.\n\n![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2018/09/13/iEiIRx.png)\n\n\n\n### Multi segments Co-translation\n\nMore efficient, while keeping the original segment as much as possible.\n\n![entoch](./assets/entoch.png)\n\n### Tap to Copy(Experimental)\n\nAfter turning on the `listen Clipboard` option, just select the text, and hover the mouse over the selected text to release the mouse over 0.3s.
