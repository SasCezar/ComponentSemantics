If you are already familiar with `git`, follow these steps:\n\n1. If you haven\'t already, start by [forking](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository. \n2. [Create a new branch](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-branch-for-your-work) in your fork. Name it using the product you want to add \n3. Switch to that branch (should happen automatically if you\'ve just created it) and open the `graveyard.json` file\n4. Use the information gathered above to add a JSON entry in the following format (note the alphabetical order of keys):\n```\n  {\n    "dateClose": "YYYY-MM-DD",\n    "dateOpen": "YYYY-MM-DD",\n    "description": "[Product Name] was a single sentence overview of the product or service.",\n    "link": "https://any.link-to-a.source/will/work-and-wikipedia-is-cool",\n    "name": "[Product Name]",\n    "type": "app|service|hardware"\n  }\n```\n5. Finally, [create a Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) using the newly created branch (Important: DON\'T use the `master` branch for the PR). Submit it with the necessary explanations.  \n\nFor code contributions outside of `graveyard.json`, check out the [Contributing Guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Description\nThe description should be a single sentence describing the product. It should begin with the products name. For example, "Google Reader was an RSS/Atom feed aggregator." It will be attached to a generated sentence like "Killed about 5 years ago, Google Reader was an RSS/Atom feed aggregator."\n\nPlease be respectful, only use past tense.\n\n### Link\nLink should be a resource that mentions the discontinuation date and talks about the product. Wikipedia is perfect.\n\n### Type\nThe type should be either `app`, `service`, or `hardware` as a string.\n\n## Thanks Where Thanks is Due\nI\'d like to thank the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org) and [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) for their wonderful resources, including the ability to track down broken links, home page graphics, and screenshots of services from the past. They have been invaluable tools in gathering information and content for Killed by Google.
