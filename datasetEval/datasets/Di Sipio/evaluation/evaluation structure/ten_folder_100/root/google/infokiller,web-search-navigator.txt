b'# ![Logo](./src/icon48.png?raw=true) Web Search Navigator\n\n![Demo flow](./assets/demo.gif?raw=true)\n\nSimple browser extension that adds keyboard shortcuts to Google search\xe2\x84\xa2.\nGoogle search\xe2\x84\xa2 used to provide experimental keyboard navigation, but it was [often broken](https://goo.gl/1zMkYu), and seems to have been [removed as of 2017-07-31](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45513198/1014208).\nIn addition, I wanted to add new keyboard shortcuts and the existing ones to be\nmore vim like (j/k for navigation).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Chrome\n\nInstall from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enhanced-keyboard-navigat/cohamjploocgoejdfanacfgkhjkhdkek).\n\nSee below for downloading a release and installing it manually (not recommended since you won\'t get updates automatically).\n\n#### Installing from a release\n\n1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator/releases\n1. Extract the zip file to any directory you\'d like, though you need to make sure the directory is not deleted while you want to use the extension\n1. Go to extensions page in Chrome (URL: `chrome://extensions`)\n1. Enable developer mode if needed\n1. Disable other existing instances of Google Search Navigator (from the store or from loading another unpacked version)\n1. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the directory you extracted the release zip into\n\n### Firefox\n\nInstall from the [Add-ons for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/web-search-navigator/).\n\n### Edge\n\nInstall from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P0PTV58KND9).\n\n## Keybindings\n\n_Note: All shortcuts can be customized to your liking via options._\n\n*   `\xe2\x86\x93`/`j`: Select next search result\n*   `\xe2\x86\x91`/`k`: Select previous previous result\n*   `/`/`Escape`: Focus on input search box\n*   `Enter`/`Space`: Navigate to selected result\n*   `Ctrl+Enter`/`\xe2\x8c\x98+Enter`/`Ctrl+Space`: Open selected result in background tab\n*   `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`/`\xe2\x8c\x98+Shift+Enter`/`Ctrl+Shift+Space`: Open selected result in new window/tab\n*   `\xe2\x86\x90`/`h`: Navigate to previous search result page\n*   `\xe2\x86\x92`/`l`: Navigate to next search result page\n*   `a`/`s`: Navigate to All tab (= default search tab)\n*   `i`: Navigate to images tab\n*   `v`: Navigate to videos tab\n*   `m`: Navigate to maps tab\n*   `n`: Navigate to news tab\n*   `alt+s`: Navigate to shopping tab\n*   `b`: Navigate to books tab\n*   `alt+l`: Navigate to flights tab\n*   `f`: Navigate to financial tab\n*\t`z h` / `Ctrl+Shift+h`: Filter results by past hour\n*\t`z d` / `Ctrl+Shift+d`: Filter results by past 24 hours (day)\n*\t`z w` / `Ctrl+Shift+w`: Filter results by past week\n*\t`z m` / `Ctrl+Shift+m`: Filter results by past month\n*\t`z y` / `Ctrl+Shift+y`: Filter results by past year\n*\t`z z` / `Ctrl+Shift+a`: Turn off filter (show all results)\n*\t`z s` / `Ctrl+Shift+s`: Toggle sort by date/relevance (only when filtering)\n\n## Development\n\nWe use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager for dependency management and [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for build.\nInstalling and building (deploying the web extension files) is as easy as:\n\n```\nyarn install && yarn build\n```\n\nThe extension will be deployed directly to the `src` directory. You can load this directory as an unpacked extensions to\nyour browser.\n\n_It would be better to deploy for example to `build/deploy` and add `gulp-watch` to update the deployed files\nautomatically. However when done so the browser\'s (Chrome) auto-reload extension gets broken and one has to reload the\nextension manually on every change. Hence the `src` directory is used for the convenience._\n\n## Build\n\nTo deploy the production sources use:\n\n```\nyarn build --env production\n```\n\nThe automated build scripts are currently not implemented so manual process is required afterward.\n\n## TODO\n\n*   Add option for navigating "Top stories"\n\n## Privacy policy\n\nSee [PRIVACY_POLICY.md](./docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md).\n\n## Trademarks notice\n\nThis project is not affiliated with Google LLC.\n\n\xc2\xa92018 Google LLC All rights reserved.
