b"# J.A.R.V.I.S. (Java-Speech-API)\n\nJ.A.R.V.I.S. Java Speech API: Just A Reliable Vocal Interpreter & Synthesizer. \nThis is a project for the Java Speech API. The program interprets vocal inputs into text and synthesizes voices from text input.\nThe program supports dozens of languages and even has the ability to auto-detect languages! \n\n## Description\nThe J.A.R.V.I.S. Speech API is designed to be simple and efficient, using the speech engines created by Google to provide functionality for parts of the API. Essentially, it is an API written in Java, including a recognizer, synthesizer, and a microphone capture utility. The project uses Google services for the synthesizer and recognizer.  While this requires an Internet connection, it provides a complete, modern, and fully functional speech API in Java.\n\n## Features\nThe API currently provides the following functionality,\n\n  * Microphone Capture API (Wrapped around the current Java API for simplicity)\n  * A speech recognizer using Google's recognizer service\n      * Converts WAVE files from microphone input to FLAC (using existing API, see CREDITS)\n      * Retrieves Response from Google, including confidence score and text\n  * A speech synthesiser using Google's synthesizer service\n      * Retrieves synthesized text in an InputStream (MP3 data ready to be played)\n  * Wave to FLAC API (Wrapped around the used API in the project, javaFlacEncoder, see CREDITS)\n  * A translator using Google Translate (courtesy of Skylion's Google Toolkit)\n\n## Notes\n\nTo get access to the Google API, you need an API key. To get this, you need to follow the instructions here: \n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26485531/google-speech-api-v2\n\nA sample application using this library can be found here:\n* See API-Example repository branch. \n\n## Changelog\nSee CHANGELOG.markdown for Version History/Changelog\n\n## Credits\nSee CREDITS.markdown for Credits\n"
