b'# [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joscha/play-authenticate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joscha/play-authenticate) PlayAuthenticate - An extensible authentication plugin for Play! Framework 2 (Java)\n\n> MAINTAINERS WANTED!!!! Please drop me a message if you want to help out!\n\nThis plugin uses concepts from [securesocial2][] and [Play20StartApp][] and provides a sample containing code from [deadbolt2][].\n\n#### Version information\n**Play Authenticate currently needs Play! Framework 2.0.2 or later**\n\nPlay Authenticate is cross-tested in Java 1.6, Java 1.7 (Up to `0.6.x`) and Java 1.8 (from `0.7.0`)\n\nSince Play 2.6 it\'s cross-compiled for both Scala 2.11 and 2.12.\n\nWorks fine with Play version\n\n* `2.0.2` to `2.0.x` (last: `0.2.3-SNAPSHOT` - [2.0.x branch](https://github.com/joscha/play-authenticate/tree/2.0.x))\n* `2.1.0` to `2.1.x` (last: `0.3.6` - [2.1.x branch](https://github.com/joscha/play-authenticate/tree/2.1.x))\n* `2.2.0` to `2.2.x` (last: `0.5.4` - [2.2.x branch](https://github.com/joscha/play-authenticate/tree/2.2.x))\n* `2.3.0` to `2.3.x` (last: `0.6.9` - [2.3.x branch](https://github.com/joscha/play-authenticate/tree/2.3.x))\n* `2.4.0` to `2.4.x` (last: `0.7.x` - [2.4.x branch](https://github.com/joscha/play-authenticate/tree/2.4.x))\n* `2.5.0` to `2.5.x` (last: `0.8.x` - [2.5.x branch](https://github.com/joscha/play-authenticate/tree/2.5.x))\n* `2.6.0` to `2.6.x` (last: `0.9.x` - [master branch](https://github.com/joscha/play-authenticate/tree/master))\n\nReleases are on [mvnrepository](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.feth) and snapshots can be found on [sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/feth/).\n\n## Live demo\nYou can find a live demo on [heroku](https://play-authenticate.herokuapp.com/ "Play Authenticate sample app") and there are some screens on our [website](http://joscha.github.io/play-authenticate/).\n\n## Quickstart\nClone the project, go to `samples/java/play-authenticate-usage` and run `sbt run` to see a sample application. There are only very few of the providers enabled, because for most of them, you need to add OAuth credentials which you can get at the various different providers.\n\n### Including the Dependencies\n\nPlay-Authenticate is available in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#browse%7C1025599758).\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.feth</groupId>\n    <artifactId>play-authenticate</artifactId>\n    <version>0.9.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\nor\n\n```scala\nval appDependencies = Seq(\n  "com.feth" %% "play-authenticate" % "0.9.0"\n)\n```\n\n## Features\n\n* Fully customizable and localizable controllers and views (e.g. Play Authenticate allows you to define your own controllers and views for every visual step of the signup and/or log in process)\n* Completely dynamic URL generation for all views (uses the route file - means you can adapt the look and feel as much as you like).\n\t* The sample shows how to do this with Twitter bootstrap\n* Linking of accounts (e.g. one local user with multiple authentication providers)\n\t* Linking can be done automatically or after asking the user (default)\n* Merge detection (e.g. a user created two unconnected local accounts)\n\t* Account merge can be done automatically or after asking the user (default)\n* Tight [deadbolt2][] authorization integration (Sample included).\n* HTTPS support (for OAuth2 redirect links and email verification).\n* Verification email used by Email/Password provider is fully customizable and localizable and can be sent in either text or HTML or both.\n\n### Providers\nAs of now, the following authentication providers are supported out of the box:\n\n* _OAuth 2_\n  * ![Facebook](samples/java/play-authenticate-usage/public/icons/facebook-24x24.png)\n  * ![Foursquare](samples/java/play-authenticate-usage/public/icons/foursquare-24x24.png)\n  * ![Google](samples/java/play-authenticate-usage/public/icons/google-24x24.png)\n  * Untappd\n  * VK.com / VKontakte\n  * Pocket\n  * ![github](samples/java/play-authenticate-usage/public/icons/github-24x24.png)\n  * ![Eventbrite](samples/java/play-authenticate-usage/public/icons/eventbrite-24x24.png)\n* _OAuth 1_\n  * ![LinkedIn](samples/java/play-authenticate-usage/public/icons/linkedin-24x24.png)\n  * ![Twitter](samples/java/play-authenticate-usage/public/icons/twitter-24x24.png)\n  * ![Xing](samples/java/play-authenticate-usage/public/icons/xing-24x24.png)\n* ![OpenID](samples/java/play-authenticate-usage/public/icons/openid-24x24.png) OpenID\n* ![E-Mail](samples/java/play-authenticate-usage/public/icons/password-24x24.png) Email/Password (with email verification, password security/encryption is fully customizable)\n* [Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)\n* [SPNEGO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPNEGO)\n* Your very own authentication provider (LDAP, DB, you-name-it) via an extensible, easy-to-use plugin mechanism based on Play Plugins\n\nThe included sample application shows how to use all of those providers.\nThere is also a [sample application using Play!Authenticate with MongoDB](https://github.com/ntenisOT/play-authenticate-mongo).\n\n### Languages\n* English\n* German (as of 2012-07-09)\n* Polish (as of 2012-08-03)\n* French (as of 2012-08-28,  commit `967e11e207`)\n* Spanish (as of 2013-03-02, commit `59613c5a44`)\n* Italian (as of 2013-09-21, core only, commit `b1b9e2a46b`)\n* Japanese (as of 2013-11-27, commit `fd4cc56b168d9ed447943c879dd61f271158edf7`)\n* Portuguese (as of 2014-07-29)\n* Chinese (as of 2017-04-18)\n\n## Versions\n* **TRUNK** [not released in the repository, yet]\n  * Fancy contributing something?
