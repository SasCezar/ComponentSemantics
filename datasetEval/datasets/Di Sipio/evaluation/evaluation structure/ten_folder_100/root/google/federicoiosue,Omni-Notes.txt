It aims to provide an attractive look and follow the most recent design guidelines of the Google operating system.\n\n**Follow the developments and post your comments and advice on Facebook Community

User guide\n\nLook into the wiki for GIFs-based tutorials: [LINK](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/wiki)\n\n## Build\n\nWatch the following terminal session recording on how to compile distributable files\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/102898.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/102898)\n\n## Test\n\nTo execute all tests included into the project connect a device or emulator, then run the following command:\n\n```shell\n./gradlew connectedAndroidTest\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nDue to the fact that I\'m using [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) as code versioning methodology, you as developer should **always** start working on [develop branch](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/tree/develop) that contains the most recent changes.\n\nThere are many features/improvements that are not on **my** roadmap but someone else could decide to work on them anyway: hunt for issues tagged as [Help Wanted](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/issues?utf8=\xe2\x9c\x93&q=label%3A"Help+wanted") to find them!\n\nFeel free to add yourself to [contributors.md](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/develop/contributors.md) file.\n\n### New feature or improvements contributions\n\nThis kind of contributions **must** have screenshots or screencast as demonstration of the new additions.\n\n### Code style\n\nIf you plan to manipulate the code then you\'ll have to do it by following a [specific code style](https://gist.github.com/federicoiosue/dee53e882b3c70d544f8608769eb02fc).\nAlso pay attention if you\'re using any plugin that automatically formats/cleans/rearrange your code and set it to only change that code that you touched and not the whole files.\n\n### Test your code contributions!\n\nAll code changes and additions **must** be tested.\nSee the [related section](#test) for more informations or this two pull requests comments: [one](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/pull/646#pullrequestreview-187973443) and [two](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/pull/683#issuecomment-506206689)\n\n### Forking project\n\nWhen forking the project you\'ll have to modify some files that are strictly dependent from my own development / build / third-party-services environment. Files that need some attention are the following:\n\n  - *gradle.properties*: this is overridden by another file with the same name inside the *omniNotes* module. You can do the same or leave as it is, any missing property will let the app gracefully fallback on a default behavior.\n  - *.travis.yml*: if you use [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) as continuous integration platform and a SonarQUBE instance for code quality analysis you\'ll have to modify this file according to your needs.\n\n## Code quality\n\nA public instance of SonarQube is available both to encourage other developers to improve their code contributions (and existing code obviously) and to move the project even further into transparency and openness.\n\nCheckout for it [here](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=omni-notes)\n\nPull requests will be automatically analyzed and rejected if they\'ll rise the code technical debt.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThey\'re all listed into the [build.gradle](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/develop/omniNotes/build.gradle) file but due to the fact that many of the dependences have been customized by me I\'d like to say thanks here to the original developers of these great libraries:\n\n* https://github.com/RobotiumTech/robotium\n* https://github.com/flavienlaurent/datetimepicker\n* https://github.com/LarsWerkman/HoloColorPicker\n* https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton\n* https://github.com/romannurik/dashclock/wiki/API\n* https://github.com/ACRA/acra\n* https://github.com/Shusshu/Android-RecurrencePicker\n* https://github.com/gabrielemariotti/changeloglib\n* https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus\n* https://github.com/futuresimple/android-floating-action-button\n* https://github.com/keyboardsurfer\n* https://github.com/nhaarman/ListViewAnimations\n* https://github.com/bumptech/glide\n* https://github.com/neopixl/PixlUI\n* https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs\n* https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife\n* https://github.com/ical4j\n* https://github.com/square/leakcanary\n* https://github.com/pnikosis/materialish-progress\n* https://github.com/apl-devs/AppIntro\n* https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid\n* https://github.com/artem-zinnatullin/RxJavaProGuardRules\n* https://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions\n* https://github.com/ocpsoft/prettytime\n* https://github.com/piwik/piwik-sdk-android\n* https://github.com/mrmans0n/smart-location-lib\n\n\n\n## Developed with love and passion by\n\n\n* Federico Iosue - [Website](https://federico.iosue.it)\n* [Other contributors](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/master/https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md)\n\n\n\n## License\n\n\n    Copyright 2013-2019 Federico Iosue\n    \n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n    \n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
