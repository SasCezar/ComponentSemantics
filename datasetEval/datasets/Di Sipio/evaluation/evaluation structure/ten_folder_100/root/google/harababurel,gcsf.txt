You can find out more in this [paper](https://sergiu.ml/~sergiu/thesis.pdf).\n\n**Update (April 2019)**: I am currently still using and maintaining this project but I have very little time to dedicate to it. As such, it might take a while before I get around to fixing known bugs / implementing feature requests / responding to open issues. Thank you for understanding and for expressing sustained interest in this project!\n\n\n### Requirements\n\nGCSF requires the stable branch of the Rust programming language, which can be installed following the instructions on [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs). If you already have Rust installed, make sure that it is updated to the latest version (\xe2\x89\xa51.26):\n\n```bash\n$ rustup update stable\n```\n\n#### OSX\n\nOn Mac OSX, GCSF requires [osxfuse](https://osxfuse.github.io/) and [pkg-config](http://macappstore.org/pkg-config/):\n\n```bash\n$ brew update; brew install pkg-config; brew tap homebrew/cask; brew cask install osxfuse\n```\n\n#### Ubuntu\n\nOn Ubuntu, GCSF requires [libfuse-dev](https://packages.ubuntu.com/disco/libfuse-dev), [libssl-dev](https://packages.ubuntu.com/disco/libssl-dev) and [pkg-config](https://packages.ubuntu.com/disco/pkg-config):\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install -y libfuse-dev libssl-dev pkg-config\n```\n\n#### Arch Linux\n\nAn AUR package is maintained by [axionl](https://github.com/axionl): [gcsf-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gcsf-git/).\n\n#### Other linux distros\n\nMake sure you have `pkg-config` and the `fuse` library installed. These are usually found in the package repositories of major distributions.\n\n#### FreeBSD\n\nRust can be installed via the `lang/rust` port. You will need to install `sysutils/fusefs-libs` for the `cairo install` command to succeed. \n\n#### Windows\n\nUnfortunately, Windows is not supported at the time being. See issue [#19](https://github.com/harababurel/gcsf/issues/19).\n\n### Installation\n\nAfter all requirements are met, GCSF can be installed using `cargo`:\n\n\n```bash\n$ cargo install gcsf\n```\n\nThis will generate the `gcsf` binary in `$HOME/.cargo/bin`. Make sure that this directory is in your `PATH` variable: `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.cargo/bin`\n\nAlternatively, you can download a [release binary](https://github.com/harababurel/gcsf/releases) for your platform.\n\n### Configuration\n\nGCSF will attempt to create a configuration file in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gcsf/gcsf.toml`, which is usually defined as `$HOME/.config/gcsf/gcsf.toml`. Credentials are stored in the same directory.\n\n### Usage\n\nThe first step is to log in to Drive and authorize the application. A name must be provided for the session:\n\n```bash\n$ gcsf login some_session_name\nPlease direct your browser to https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/[...] and follow the instructions displayed there.\nSuccessfully logged in. Saved credentials to "$HOME/.config/gcsf/some_session_name"\n```\n\nYou can also list all existing sessions:\n\n```bash\n$ gcsf list\nSessions:\n        - personal\n        - some_session_name\n        - work\n```\n\nAnd then mount one (or more) of them:\n\n```bash\n$ gcsf mount /mnt/gcsf -s some_session_name\nINFO  gcsf > Creating and populating file system...\nINFO  gcsf > File system created.\nINFO  gcsf > Mounting to /mnt/gcsf\nINFO  gcsf > Mounted to /mnt/gcsf\n```\n\nYou can now find the contents of your Drive account in `/mnt/gcsf`:\n\n<p align="left">\n  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jdFIu5Y.png" alt="GCSF ls"\n       width="530px" height="165px">\n</p>\n\nUsing Ranger:\n<p align="left">\n  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BuS9BDD.png" alt="GCSF in Ranger"\n       width="616px" height="351px">\n</p>\n\n\nOr Thunar:\n<p align="left">\n  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9JSDqez.jpg" alt="GCSF in Thunar"\n       width="746px" height="176px">\n</p>\n\n### Why GCSF?\nGCSF stands for "Google Conduce Sistem de Fi\xc8\x99iere" which translated from Romanian is "Google Drive Filesystem". However [GDFS](https://github.com/robin-thomas/GDFS) already exists so it remains GCSF.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### Could not mount to `$mountpoint`: Operation not permitted (os error 1)\n\nThis error occurs when `user_allow_other` is not set in `/etc/fuse.conf` or the file has improper permissions. Fix by running (as root):\n\n```bash\n# echo \'user_allow_other\' >> /etc/fuse.conf\n# chmod 644 /etc/fuse.conf\n# sudo chown root:root /etc/fuse.conf\n```\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome. Documentation available on [docs.rs/gcsf](https://docs.rs/gcsf). You can also help by reporting or fixing [issues](https://github.com/harababurel/gcsf/issues).\n'
