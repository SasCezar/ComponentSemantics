Now powered by Google and Mapbox.\n\nIf you use it and you like it, please consider to make a donation to support its development! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc\n\n<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/eddiesigner" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/black_img.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" style="height: auto !important;width: auto !important;" ></a>\n\n### Mapbox\n\n![Mapbox](/assets/mapbox.gif?raw=true "Map Generator using Mapbox")\n\n### Google Maps\n\n![Google Maps](/assets/google.gif?raw=true "Map Generator using Google Maps")\n\n## Important, read carefully\n\nFrom now on you will have to generate your own Google Maps key and your own Mapbox token so that the plugin can generate maps.\n\nDuring all this time the plugin has used my own Google Maps key and my own Mapbox token but due to the increasing number of people using it, has reached the point where I had to pay more and more in the case of Google Maps, while in the case of Mapbox, over time there have been more failed map requests because the limit of use is exceeded relatively quickly.\n\nHaving said that and taking into account that the plugin is completely free, I have made the decision that from now on the plugin will only work if each user provides their own key or their own token. Although this change at first may seem negative, it also brings with it the following benefits:\n\n* In the case of Mapbox there should no longer be failed requests for reaching the limit allowed because it will no longer be distributed by all users of the plugin, you and only you will use your own token, this will make it virtually impossible to reach that limit.\n\n* In the case of Google Maps also virtually eliminates the risk of reaching the limit per day that currently exists. You can also generate maps up to 1280x1280 pixels.\n\nThe only drawback to take into account is that in order to generate a key for Google Maps, you will have to enter credit card details in the Google Cloud Console. But don\'t worry, it will be very difficult to pay even a single cent because only you will be using your own key.\n\nIn order to help you here you have some guides on how to generate a Google Maps key and a Mapbox token:\n\n[How to generate a Google Maps key](https://github.com/eddiesigner/sketch-map-generator/wiki/How-to-generate-a-Google-Maps-key)\n\n[How to get your Mapbox tokens](https://github.com/eddiesigner/sketch-map-generator/wiki/How-to-get-your-Mapbox-tokens)\n\n**The Google Maps key API and the Mapbox token that the plugin has used so far will stop working on September 30th.**\n\n## How it works?\n\nCreate a shape and select it.\n<br>\nRun the Map Generator Plugin:\n##### Google Maps\nPlugins > Map Generator > Generate a Map using Google Maps\n<br>\nShortcut: <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>\n##### Mapbox\nPlugins > Map Generator > Generate a Map using Mapbox\n<br>\nShortcut: <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>\n<br><br>\nChoose the location, styling and zoom.\n<br>\nVoila!

Now you can see a live preview before generating a map.\n* \xf0\x9f\x93\x8d You can move the map preview, drag a pin to pick a location and change the zoom  with no effort. You can still change the address settings as before if you wish.\n* \xf0\x9f\x92\x85\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc A whole new UI.\n* \xf0\x9f\x8c\x93 Dark mode support.\n* \xf0\x9f\x9b\xa0 Improvements and bugfixes.\n* Thanks to [Guillermo](https://guillermoseis.com/) for the logo!\n\n## Installation\n\n[![Install Sketch Map Generator with Sketchpacks](/assets/sketchpacks.png?raw=true "Install Sketch Map Generator with Sketchpacks")](https://sketchpacks.com/eddiesigner/sketch-map-generator/install)\n\n#### Install with Sketch Runner\nWith Sketch Runner, just go to the `install` command and search for `Map Generator`.
