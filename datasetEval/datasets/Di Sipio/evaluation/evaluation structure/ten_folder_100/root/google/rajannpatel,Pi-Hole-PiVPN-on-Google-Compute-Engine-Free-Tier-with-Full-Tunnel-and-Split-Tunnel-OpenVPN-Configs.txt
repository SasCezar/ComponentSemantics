b'# Set up a Pi-Hole Ad Blocking VPN Server with a static Anycast IP on Google Cloud\'s Always Free Usage Tier\n## Configure Full Tunnel or Split Tunnel OpenVPN connections from your Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, & Windows devices\n\n<img src="./images/data-privacy-risk.svg" width="125" align="right">\n\nThe goal of this guide is to enable you to safely and privately use the Internet on your phones, tablets, and computers with a self-run VPN Server in the cloud. It can be run at no cost to you; shields you from intrusive advertisements; and blocks your ISP, cell phone company, public WiFi hotspot provider, and apps/websites from gaining insight into your usage activity.\n\n<img src="./images/upfront-cost.svg" width="90" align="right">\n\nRun your own privacy-first ad blocking service within the **[Free Usage Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/)** on Google Cloud. **This guide gets you set up with a Google Cloud account, and walks you through setting up a full tunnel (all traffic) or split tunnel (DNS traffic only) VPN connection on your Android & iOS devices, and computers.**\n\nBoth Full Tunnel and Split Tunnel VPN connections provide DNS based ad-blocking over an encrypted connection to the cloud. The differences are:\n\n- A Split Tunnel VPN allows you to interact with devices on your Local Network (such as a Chromecast or Roku).\n- A Full Tunnel VPN can help bypass misconfigured proxies on corporate WiFi networks, and protects you from Man-In-The-Middle SSL proxies.\n\n| Tunnel Type | Data Usage | Server CPU Load | Security | Ad Blocking |\n| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |\n| full | +10% overhead for vpn | moderate | 100% encryption | yes\n| split | just kilobytes per day | very low | dns encryption only | yes\n\nThe technical merits of major choices in this guide are outlined in [REASONS.md](./REASONS.md).\n\n---\n\n<img src="./images/logos/cloud.svg" width="48" align="left">\n\n# Google Cloud Login and Account Creation\n\nGo to https://cloud.google.com and click **Console** at the top right if you have previously used Google\'s Cloud Services, or click **Try Free** if it\'s your first time.\n\n### Account Creation\n- **Step 1 of 2** <br> Agree to the terms and continue. <br><img src="./images/screenshots/5.png" width="265">\n- **Step 2 of 2** <br> Set up a payments profile and continue <br><img src="./images/screenshots/5.png" width="223">\n### Project & Compute Engine Creation\n1.

Create a Virtual Machine instance on Compute Engine: <br><img src="./images/screenshots/8.png" width="216">\n2. Customize the instance: <br><img src="./images/screenshots/8.png" width="216">\n3. Name your Virtual Machine **pi-hole**. <br>Your Region selection should be any US region only (excluding Northern Virginia [us-east4]). I have used **us-east1** and the **us-east1-b** zone because it is closest to me. <br>Choose a **micro** Machine Type in the dropdown. <br>Change the **Boot Disk** to be **30GB** if you plan on keeping your DNS lookup records for any reason, otherwise the default **10GB** disk allocation is adequate. <br>**Allow HTTP traffic** in the Firewall (add a checkmark).\n<br>**Allow HTTPS traffic** in the Firewall (add a checkmark). <br><img src="./images/screenshots/9.png" width="232">\n4.

Choose **Create IP Address** to Reserve a New Static IP Address <br><img src="./images/screenshots/13.png" width="230"> <br><img src="./images/screenshots/14.png" width="395">\n6. You can log into your Virtual Machine via SSH in a Browser by clicking the SSH button. Make note of your External IP (it will be different from the screenshot below).<br><img src="./images/screenshots/15.png" width="369">\n7. Click the Hamburger Menu at the top left, click **VPC Network** and click **Firewall Rules**. <br><img src="./images/screenshots/firewall.png" width="222"> <br>Click **Create Firewall Rule** at the top center of the page. The name of your rule should be `allow-openvpn`, change the **Targets** dropdown to **All instances in the network**. The **Source IP Ranges** should be `0.0.0.0/0`. The **udp** checkbox should be selected, and the port number next to it should be changed from `all` to `1194`. Then click the **Create** button. You can disable the `default-allow-rdp` rule which Google set up with a default action of Allow, but because our server does not run any service on Port 3389 it is harmless to leave this rule alone. Do not disable the **default-allow-ssh** firewall rule, or you will disable the browser-based SSH from within the Google Cloud Console.\n\n<img src="./images/logos/debian.svg" width="48" align="left">\n\n# Debian Update & Upgrade\n\nOnce you log into your Virtual Machine via SSH, you want to update and upgrade it.\n\nEnsure you have elevated root privileges by running this command in the bash shell:\n\n```\nsudo su\n```\n\nUpdate and upgrade by running this command in the bash shell:\n\n```\napt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y\n```\n\n<img src="./images/logos/pihole.svg" width="48" align="left">\n\n# Pi-Hole Installation\n\nPi-Hole is a DNS based adblocker.\n\nEnsure you have elevated root privileges by running this command in the bash shell:\n\n```\nsudo su\n```\n\nInstall Pi-Hole by running this command in the bash shell:\n\n```\ncurl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash\n```\n\nYou will flow into a series of prompts in a blue screen.\n\n- Choose OK or answer positively for all the prompts until the "Select Protocols" question appears.

A DNS leak will result in ads appearing.\n\nIn the Pi-Hole Web Interface at `http://your-external-ip/admin/settings.php?tab=dns` choose just one DNS provider. The two Google IPv4 DNS servers will give you the highest performance. For our test, we will deselect the Google IPv4 DNS servers and choose the 2 Cloudflare DNS servers.\n\n<img src="./images/screenshots/test-dns.png" width="378">\n\nOn your device, go to https://www.dnsleaktest.com/ and click the **Extended test** button. On the table in the next page, every single row must say "Cloudflare". If you see any IPs that do not belong to Cloudflare, you have a DNS leak. This typically means you have a problem with your server configuration and client configuration files.\n\nTurn your VPN off and try the **Extended test** again, you will see your default DNS servers as defined by your Internet provider or your Router.\n\nOnce you are done testing, only use the Google IPv4 Upstream DNS Servers if you want the fastest DNS resolvers for your Pi-Hole. You can use any of the other Upstream DNS servers if speed is not your number one requirement.\n\n## Test the Ad-blocking\n\nA quick test page to verify if your ad blocking is working: https://blockads.fivefilters.org/?pihole\n\nThe Pi-Hole project also maintains a list of excellent advertising-littered pages that you can test:\nhttps://pi-hole.net/pages-to-test-ad-blocking-performance/\n\n<img src="./images/logos/firewall.svg" width="48" align="left">\n\n# Firewall\n\nYou may not be comfortable leaving the Pi-Hole web interface accessible on a Public IP\n\nIf you do not wish for the Pi-Hole web interface to be accessible publicly, disable Port 80 in your Google Cloud Firewall.\n\n1. Log into Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/\n2. Ensure your Project is selected in the blue bar at the top (next to the words "Google Cloud Console); by default it should be\n3. Click the Hamburger Menu at the top left, click **VPC Network** and click **Firewall Rules**\n4. Click **default-allow-http** in the table\n5. Click **Edit** at the top of the page\n6. Click **Disable Rule** above the "Save" button to reveal a radio button group\n7. Select **Disabled**\n8. Click the **Save** button\n\nTo access your Pi-Hole web interface once you do this, you will have to connect via VPN, and then go to http://10.8.0.1 if you are using a UDP profile (desirable), or http://10.9.0.1 if you are using the TCP profile (less desirable).\n\nOther Firewall rules you can safely disable:\n\n- **default-allow-rdp** is not necessary, because your Pi-Hole is not running on a Windows server and there is no service running on Port 3389\n\nFirewall rules that are inconvenient to disable:\n\n- **default-allow-ssh** should really only be open to Google\'s private network, alas they leave it open to the whole world by default. Nobody can successfully brute force their way into your server on Port 22, because it\'s not secured with passwords. It is secured with keys. If you disable this rule, you will not be able to use the browser based SSH interface in the Google Cloud Console until you re-enable this rule.\n\n\n# Configure automated Pi-Hole updates and scheduled reboots\n\nPiVpn enables automated security updates of your Pi-Hole, but it won\'t restart the VM if the update requires it.  Restarting the VM would require SSH\'ing into it and restarting it if required.  To remove that step, let\'s use a daily cron job to check to see if a restart is required and restart the VM as necessary.\n\nTo do that, let\'s add a new file to `/etc/cron.daily/` called `zz-restart-if-required` using the following command `sudo nano /etc/cron.daily/zz-restart-if-required`.  In nano, add the following lines of code which check to see if the reboot-required token file is present, restarting the VM if so:\n\n    #!/bin/sh\n    if [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ]; then\n      /sbin/shutdown -r now\n    fi\n\nFiles stored in `/etc/cron.daily/` will only run if the permissions are configured to allow that, so we need to change the permissions to allow that file to run.  To do that, execute `sudo chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/zz-restart-if-required`.\n\nSimilarly, Pi-Hole gets updated from time to time.  Let\'s automate installing those updates as well.  To do that, let\'s create a file using `sudo nano /etc/cron.daily/update-pi-hole` and add in the following chunk of code:\n\n    #!/bin/sh\n    /usr/local/bin/pihole -up\n    \nWe need to change its permissions so it is executible `sudo chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/update-pi-hole`.\n\nIf you\'re curious when they will run, [Stack Exchange has a great Q&A for you](https://serverfault.com/questions/135906/when-does-cron-daily-run).\n\n\n\n<img src="./images/logos/cloudconsole.svg" width="48" align="left">\n\n# Cloud Console Mobile App\n\n<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.cloudconsole" target="_blank">\n<img src="./images/logos/google-play.svg" alt="Get it on Google Play" height="60"></a>\n<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-cloud-console/id1005120814?mt=8#iTunes" target="_blank">\n<img src="./images/logos/app-store.svg" alt="Get it on the App Store" height="60"></a>\n\nInstall the "Cloud Console" app on your Android or iOS device.\n\nManage and monitor Google Cloud Platform services from your Android or iOS device.\n\n\n# Contributions Welcome\n\nIf there is something that can be done better, or if this documentation can be improved in any way, please submit a Pull Request with your fixes or edits.\n\nContributors should be aware of [REASONS.md](./REASONS.md), which explain the factors behind choices made throughout this guide.\n\nPlease review the [Issues](https://github.com/rajannpatel/Pi-Hole-PiVPN-on-Google-Compute-Engine-Free-Tier-with-Full-Tunnel-and-Split-Tunnel-OpenVPN-Configs/issues) if you are in a position to help others, or participate in improving this project.\n'
