b'# Google CTF\n\nThis repository lists most of the challenges used in the Google CTF 2017. The missing challenges are not ready to be open-sourced, or contain third-party code.\n\n**IMPORTANT** - The code in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 folders has unfixed security vulnerabilities. These are there on purpose, and running these on real production infrastructure is not safe.\n\nRead more about the Google CTF here: https://security.googleblog.com/2017/06/announcing-google-capture-flag-2017.html\n\n\nNote this is not an official Google product\n'
