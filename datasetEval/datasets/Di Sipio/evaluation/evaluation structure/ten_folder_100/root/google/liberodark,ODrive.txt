Alternatively, you can download and extract the zip from github\'s interface.\n\nThe steps below (Setup, Build, Run) are to execute in order to ready everything. \n\n## Setup\n\nThis step is only needed once, in order to install the necessary environment on your computer for ODrive to run.\n\n```bash\n# Needed for electron 1.7+ to run, as it\'s based on chrome\nsudo apt install libgconf-2-4\n```\n\nNote: If you\'re using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.\n\n## Build\n\nThis step is to execute every new version of the source code.\n\nIn the project directory:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nNote: If you\'re using Ubuntu and you get an error message about a missing node binary, you may want to try [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18130164/nodejs-vs-node-on-ubuntu-12-04): \n\n```sudo ln -s `which nodejs` /usr/bin/node```\n\nIf you are working on the code yourself and editing some files in `app/assets/`, you will need to run `npm run webpack` (or `npm install`) for those changes to have an impact on the application.\n\n## Run\n\nIn the project directory:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nOn Windows, you can make a `.bat` file with `start cmd /k nmp start` that then you can double click to launch the program.\n\nThe launch-on-startup functionality is only available on bundled releases. See the **Deployment** section.\n\n## Testing\n\nTo make sure the code is ok and run some sanity checks on it:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Releases\n\nThere are currently three "release" formats supported: nsis (Windows installer) for Windows, AppImage for Linux, and DMG for Mac. You can generate them like this:\n\n```bash\nnpm run release-windows\nnpm run release-linux\nnpm run release-mac\n```\n\nTo create a different format, like a deb or rpm package for example:\n\nFor DEB\n```bash\nnpm run release-linux deb\n```\nFor RPM\n```\nsudo yum install rpm-build -y\nnpm run release-linux rpm\n```\n\nThe releases are generated in the `dist` folder.\n\nAll formats supported by [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) are available, such as 7z, zip, tar.gz, deb, rpm, freebsd, pacman, p5p, apk, dmg, pkg, mas, nsis, appx, msi...\n\n### Permissionless deployment\n\nAn appimage on linux already runs permissionless. Anyway, you can just do:\n\n```bash\n# Permissonless deployment\nnpm run release-windows dir # or zip, 7zip, tar.xz, tar.7z, ...\n```\n\nThis will create a folder in `dist` that you can just copy to a Windows machine.\n\n## License\n\n[GPL v3](LICENSE.md)\n'
