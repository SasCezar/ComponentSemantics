It can run anywhere Kubernetes is deployed: public cloud, on-prem or hybrid cloud.\n\nCyclone is architectured with a low-level workflow engine that is application agnostic, offering capabilities like\nworkflow DAG scheduling, resource lifecycle management and most importantly, a pluggable and extensible framework for\nextending the core APIs. Above which, Cyclone provides built-in support for high-level functionalities, with CI/CD\npipelines and AI DevOps being two notable examples, and it is possible to expand to more use cases as well.\n\nWith Cyclone, users end up with the flexibility of workflow orchestration and the usability of complete CI/CD and AI DevOps solutions.\n\n## Features\n\n- DAG graph scheduling: Cyclone supports DAG workflow execution\n- Parameterization: stage (unit of execution) can be parameterized to maximize configuration reuse\n- External integration: external systems like SCM, docker registry, S3 can be easily integrated with Cyclone\n- Triggers: Cyclone supports cron and webhook trigger today, with upcoming support for other types of triggers\n- Controllability: workflow execution can be paused, resumed, retried or cancelled\n- Multi-cluster: workflow can be executed in different clusters from where Cyclone is running\n- Multi-tenancy: resource manifests and workflow executions are grouped and isolated per tenant\n- Garbage Collection: automatic resource cleanup after workflow execution\n- Logging: logs are persisted and independent from workflow lifecycle, enabling offline inspection\n- Built-in Pipeline: curated DAG templates and stage runtimes for running DevOps pipelines for both regular software and AI development\n- Delegation Workload: Delegate some complicated stage to be executed in external systems, instead of Cyclone.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n> Cyclone has been tested with Kubernetes 1.12, 1.13 and 1.14.\n\nMake sure [Helm](https://helm.sh/) with a version higher than **2.10** is installed ([install guide](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#install-helm)), then install Cyclone with:\n\n```bash\n$ helm install --name cyclone --namespace cyclone-system ./helm/cyclone\n```\n\nIf you want to configure the installation or want to install from source code, please refer to [Cyclone Install Guide](docs/installation.md).\n\nThen you can access Cyclone with kubectl or Cyclone web (http://<node-ip>:30022).\n\n## Community\n\n- **Slack**: Join [Cyclone Community](https://cycloneworkflow.slack.com/) for disscussions and posting questions.
