b"# circleci-cli\n\nThis project is the seed for CircleCI's new command-line application.\n\n[Documentation](https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli) |\n[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) |\n[Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) |\n[Hacking](./HACKING.md)\n\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli)\n[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli.svg?label=latest)](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli/releases)\n[![GoDoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/godoc-reference-blue.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli)\n[![Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-red.svg)](./LICENSE)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### From Scratch\n\n#### Install script\n\nIf you're installing the new `circleci` CLI for the first time, run the following command:\n\n```\ncurl -fLSs https://circle.ci/cli | bash\n```\n\nBy default, the `circleci` app will be installed to the ``/usr/local/bin`` directory. If you do not have write permissions to `/usr/local/bin`, you may need to run the above command with `sudo`:\n\n```\ncurl -fLSs https://circle.ci/cli | sudo bash\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can install to an alternate location by defining the `DESTDIR` environment variable when invoking `bash`:\n\n```\ncurl -fLSs https://circle.ci/cli | DESTDIR=/opt/bin bash\n```\n\nYou can also set a specific version of the CLI to install with the `VERSION` environment variable:\n\n```\ncurl -fLSs https://circle.ci/cli | VERSION=0.1.5222 sudo bash\n```\n\n\n#### Homebrew\n\n```\nbrew install circleci\n```\n\n#### Snapcraft\n\n```\nsudo snap install circleci\n```\n\n### Upgrade from existing CLI\n\nIf you installed the old CLI before, and you're on version less than `0.1.6`, you need to run the following commands:\n\n```\ncircleci update\ncircleci switch\n```\n\nThis command may require `sudo` if your user doesn't have write permissions to the install directory, `/usr/local/bin`. Otherwise, you may see the following error:\n\n```\nmv: cannot move 'circleci' to '/usr/local/bin/circleci': Permission denied\n```\n\n\n### Updating after install\n\nThe CLI comes with a built in version managment system. You can check if there any updates pending and update if so using the following commands:\n```\ncircleci update check\ncircleci update install\n```\n\n## Configure the CLI\n\nAfter installing the latest version of our CLI, you must run setup to configure the tool.\n\n```\n$ circleci setup\n```\n\nYou should be prompted to enter the _CircleCI API Token_ you generated from the [Personal API Token tab](https://circleci.com/account/api)\n\n\n```\n\xe2\x9c\x94 CircleCI API Token: \n\nAPI token has been set.\n\n\xe2\x9c\x94 CircleCI Host: https://circleci.com\n\nCircleCI host has been set.\n\nSetup complete. Your configuration has been saved.\n```\n\n\nIf you are using this tool on `circleci.com`. accept the provided default `CircleCI Host`.\n\nServer users will have to change the default value to your custom address (i.e. `circleci.my-org.com`).\n\n**Note**: Server does not yet support config processing and orbs, you will only be able to use `circleci local execute` (previously `circleci build`) for now.\n\n\n## Validate A Build Config\n\nTo ensure that the tool is installed, you can use it to validate a build config file.\n\n```\n$ circleci config validate\n\nConfig file at .circleci/config.yml is valid\n```\n\n\n## Docker\n\nThe CLI may also be used without installation by using Docker.\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data circleci/circleci-cli:alpine config validate /data/.circleci/config.yml --token $TOKEN\n```\n\n## circleci-agent\n\nIn order to maintain backwards compatibility with the `circleci` binary present in builds, some commands are proxied to a program called `circleci-agent`.\n\nThis program must exist in your `$PATH` as is the case inside of a job.\n\nThe following commands are affected:\n\n* `circleci tests split`\n* `circleci step halt`\n* `circleci config migrate`\n\n## Contributing\n\nDevelopment instructions for the CircleCI CLI can be found in [HACKING.md](HACKING.md).\n\n## More\n\nPlease see the [documentation](https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli) or `circleci help` for more.\n"
