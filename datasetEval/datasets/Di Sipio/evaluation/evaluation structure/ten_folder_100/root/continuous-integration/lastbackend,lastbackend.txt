All of these technologies provided out of the box and don\'t requiring additional research and setup.\n\n![alt text](docs/assets/structure.png?raw=true "Image")\n\n\nPlatform structure:\n\n- REST API server\n- State controller\n- Resources Scheduler\n- Node agent\n- Service discovery\n- Ingress proxy\n- Log collector\n- IPVS-based load-balancer\n- VxLAN-based overlay network\n- Storage runtime driver\n- Container runtime\n- Container images runtime\n\n\n## Key features\n\n1. Fast application deploying to any server\n2. Easy application sharing\n3. Easy application management\n4. Deploying application by url\n5. Deploying scheduling\n6. Deploying stateful services.\n7. Developer-friendly CLI\n\n\n## Runtime design principles\nOur design principles allows us to create extendable and powerful system. We separated runtime into particular package and use interfaces to add ability to extend supported technologies.\nBy default Last.Backend operate with this runtimes:\n- CRI - container runtime interface: docker by default\n- CII - container image interface: docker by default\n- CSI - container storage interface: host directory by default\n- CNI - container network interface: vxlan by default\n- CPI - container proxy interface: IPVS by default\n\nAll these runtimes are documented in runtime section, where are described all methods, types and algorithms.\n\n## Endpoint interface\nThe main endpoint to manage cluster is REST API interface.\nOur team use swagger for generation API documentation. To create swagger spec, just execute ``` make swagger-spec``` command in root of repository.\n\n\nYou can use REST API in these options:\n\n- directly with CURL or another apps\n- using Last.Backend CLI (located in separate repo [lastbackend/cli](https://github.com/lastbackend/cli))\n- for building custom go apps - you can use golang client located in `pgk/api/client` package\n\n## Current state\n\nCurrent version is in public beta stage and include:\n- cluster management\n- node management\n- overlay network based on vxlan\n- internal endpoints for pods balancing based on IPVS\n- ingress server based on haproxy\n- internal discovery server\n- services management with basic blue/green deployments\n- volumes management\n\nAll of these functionality is under active test now, so don\'t surprised by frequent PRs please.\n\nJoin us in Gitter [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/lastbackend/lastbackend.svg)](https://gitter.im/lastbackend/lastbackend?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\nThis project has [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md), feel free to offer your features. \n\nWe are actively searching for contributors!
