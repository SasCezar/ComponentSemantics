b"PHPCI\n=====\n\nPHPCI is a free and open source (BSD License) continuous integration tool specifically designed for PHP. We've  built it with simplicity in mind, so whilst it doesn't do *everything* Jenkins can do, it is a breeze to set up and use.\n\n\n## What it does:\n* Clones your project from Github, Bitbucket or a local path\n* Allows you to set up and tear down test databases.\n* Installs your project's Composer dependencies.\n* Runs through any combination of the [supported plugins](https://docs.phptesting.org/en/latest/#plugins).\n* You can mark directories for the plugins to ignore.\n* You can mark certain plugins as being allowed to fail (but still run.)\n\n### What it doesn't do (yet):\n* Virtualised testing.\n* Multiple PHP-version tests.\n* Install PEAR or PECL extensions.\n* Deployments - We strongly recommend using [Deployer](http://phpdeployment.org)\n\n## Getting Started:\nWe've got documentation on our website on [installing PHPCI](https://docs.phptesting.org/en/latest/installing-phpci/) and [adding support for PHPCI to your projects](https://docs.phptesting.org/en/latest/adding-phpci-support-to-your-projects/).\n\n## Contributing\nContributions from others would be very much appreciated! Please read our [guide to contributing](https://github.com/dancryer/PHPCI/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved.\n\n## Questions?\nYour best place to go is the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/php-ci). If you're already a member of the mailing list, you can simply email php-ci@googlegroups.com.\n"
