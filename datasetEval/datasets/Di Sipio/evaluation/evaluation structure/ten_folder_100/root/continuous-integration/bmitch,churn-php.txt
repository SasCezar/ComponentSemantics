It examines each PHP file in the path it is provided and:\n* Checks how many commits it has.\n* Calculates the cyclomatic complexity.\n* Creates a score based on these two values.\n\nThe results are displayed in a table:\n\n![](img/output.png)\n\nA file that changes a lot and has a high complexity might be a better candidate for refactoring than a file that doesn\'t change a lot and has a low complexity.\n\n`churn-php` only assists the developer to identify files for refactoring. It\'s best to use the results in addition to your own judgment to decide which files you may want to refactor.\n\n## Compatibility ##\n* PHP 7+\n* Currently does not work on Windows command line. See [#71](https://github.com/bmitch/churn-php/issues/71) for more details.\n* Your project uses Git as version control system.\n\nIf you want to install `churn-php` in Symfony project, your Symfony components version must be 3.3 or higher.\n\n## How to Install? ##\nInstall via Composer:\n```\ncomposer require bmitch/churn-php --dev\n```\n\n## How to Use? ##\n```\nvendor/bin/churn run <one or more paths to source code> ...\nvendor/bin/churn run src\nvendor/bin/churn run src tests\n```\n\nYou can also use churn-php via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker):\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -ti -v $PWD:/app dockerizedphp/churn run src\n```\n\n## How to Configure?\nYou may add an optional `churn.yml` file which can be used to configure churn-php. The location of the churn.yml file can be customized using these commands:\n\n```\nDefault: "churn.yml" \nvendor/bin/churn run -c <path>\nvendor/bin/churn run --configuration[=CONFIGURATION] <path>\n```\nA sample `churn.yml` file looks like:\n\n```yml\n# The maximum number of files to display in the results table.\n# Default: 10\nfilesToShow: 10\n\n# The minimum score a file need to display in the results table.\n# Default: 0.1\nminScoreToShow: 0\n\n# The number of parallel jobs to use when processing files.\n# Default: 10\nparallelJobs: 10\n\n# How far back in the git history to count the number of commits to a file\n# Can be a human readable date like \'One week ago\' or a date like \'2017-07-12\'\n# Default: \'10 Years ago\'\ncommitsSince: One year ago\n\n# Files to ignore when processing. The full path to the file relative to the root of your project is required.\n# Also supports regular expressions.\n# Default: All PHP files in the path provided to churn-php are processed.\nfilesToIgnore:\n - src/Commands/ChurnCommand.php\n - src/Results/ResultsParser.php\n - src/Foo/Ba*\n\n# File extensions to use when processing.\n# Default: php\nfileExtensions:\n - php\n - inc\n ```\n\nIf a `churn.yml` file is omitted or an individual setting is omitted the default values above will be used.\n\n### Output formats\n\nYou can configure `churn` to output the result in different formats. The available formats are:\n\n* `csv`\n* `json`\n* `text` (default)\n\nTo use a different format use `--format` option. Example command for `json`: \n\n```bash\nvendor/bin/churn run --format json\n```\n\n## Tests\n* To run the PHPUnit tests execute `vendor/bin/phpunit`.\n* Before making a pull request please see the [contributing](#contributing) section below.\n\n## Similar Packages\n* https://github.com/danmayer/churn (Ruby)\n* https://github.com/chad/turbulence (Ruby)\n\n## Contact ##\nQuestions, comments, feedback?
