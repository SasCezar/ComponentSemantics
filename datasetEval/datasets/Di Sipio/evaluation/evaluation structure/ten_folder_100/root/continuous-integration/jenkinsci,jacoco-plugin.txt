b"jacoco-plugin\n=============\n\n[![Build Status](https://ci.jenkins.io/buildStatus/icon?job=Plugins/jacoco-plugin/master)](https://ci.jenkins.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/Plugins%2Fjacoco-plugin/activity) \n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jenkinsci/jacoco-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jenkinsci/jacoco-plugin)\n[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/jenkinsci/jacoco-plugin.svg)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jacoco-plugin/releases)\n\nA plugin for Jenkins to capture and visualize code coverage testing results for projects using the \nJaCoCo for code-coverage analysis.\n\nMore information can be found on the Wiki page https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JaCoCo+Plugin\n\nNote: Version 2.0.0 and higher requires using JaCoCo 0.7.5 or newer, if your projects still use JaCoCo 0.7.4, \nthe plugin will not display any code-coverage numbers any more! In this case please use version 1.0.19 until you can update jacoco in your codebase.\n\nLooking for ways to contribute?\n===============================\n\nWhen looking for things to work at there are [pull requests](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jacoco-plugin/pulls) and a \nlist of [Jenkins Issues](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20JENKINS%20AND%20status%20not%20in%20(Closed%2C%20Resolved%2C%20%22Fixed%20but%20Unreleased%22)%20AND%20component%20%3D%20jacoco-plugin%20ORDER%20BY%20key%20DESC).\n\nDiscussion list\n===============\n\nThere is a developer list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkins-jacoco-plugin-mailing-list, \nit is usually very low volume.\n\nContributing to the Plugin\n==========================\n\nPlugin source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jacoco-plugin).\n\nNew feature proposals and bug fix proposals should be submitted as\n[GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).\n\nFork the repository on GitHub, prepare your change on your forked\ncopy, and submit a pull request (see [here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jacoco-plugin/pulls) for open pull requests).\nYour pull request will be evaluated by [this job](https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/jacoco-plugin/).\n\nBefore submitting your change, please assure that you've added a test\nwhich verifies your change.  There have been many developers involved\nin the jacoco plugin and there are many, many users who depend on the\njacoco-plugin. Tests help us assure that we're delivering a reliable\nplugin, and that we've communicated our intent to other developers in\na way that they can detect when they run tests.\n\nCode coverage reporting is available as a maven target and is actively\nmonitored. Please try your best to improve code coverage with tests\nwhen you submit.\n\nBefore submitting your change, please review the findbugs output to\nassure that you haven't introduced new findbugs warnings.\n\nHow to build and test\n=====================\n\n* Build the plugin:\n\n`mvn package`\n\n* Test locally (invokes a local Jenkins instance with the plugin installed):\n\n`mvn hpi:run`\n\nSee https://jenkinsci.github.io/maven-hpi-plugin/ for details.\n"
