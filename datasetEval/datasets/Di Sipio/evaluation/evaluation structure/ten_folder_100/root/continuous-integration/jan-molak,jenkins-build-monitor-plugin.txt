b'# Jenkins CI Build Monitor Plugin\n\nBuild Monitor Plugin provides a highly visible view of the status of selected Jenkins jobs.\n\nIt easily accommodates different computer screen sizes and is ideal as an Extreme Feedback Device to be displayed on a screen on your office wall.\n(Inspired by the no longer maintained [RadiatorView](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Radiator+View+Plugin) plugin).\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jan-molak/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jan-molak/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin)\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\nHave a question? Perhaps it\'s already been answered - check the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n## Features\n\nI\'d like to keep the plugin as simple as possible, yet useful and effective.\n\nCurrent functionality of the Build Monitor plugin:\n\n* Displays the status and progress of selected jobs. The view is updated automatically every couple of seconds using AJAX, so no "Enable Auto Refresh" needed.\n* Displays the names of people who might be responsible for "breaking the build".\n* Supports the [Claim plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Claim+plugin), so that you can see who\'s fixing a broken build\n* Supports [View Job Filters](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/View+Job+Filters), so that you can easily create Build Monitors for "slow builds", "only failing", etc.\n* Supports [Build Failure Analyzer](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Failure+Analyzer), so that you know not only *who*, but also *what* broke the build; [learn more](http://bit.ly/JBMBuild102)\n* Supports [CloudBees Folders Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Folders+Plugin), so that you can have project- and team-specific nested Build Monitors; [learn more](http://bit.ly/JBMBuild117)\n* Supports [Pipeline Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin), so that the currently executing stage(s) are shown.\n* The number of columns and size of the font used is easily customisable, making it trivial to accommodate screens of different sizes.\n* UI configuration is stored in a cookie, making it possible to display different number of columns and using different font size on each of the screens at your office.\n* Can work in a colour-blind-friendly mode; [learn more](https://github.com/jan-molak/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin/issues/30#issuecomment-35849019)\n\nAll the previous releases together with their change logs are [listed here](https://bitly.com/JBMReleases).\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo use Build Monitor you\'ll need:\n* [Jenkins CI](http://jenkins-ci.org/) version 1.642.3 or newer - please note that for production installations I recommend using a [Long-Term Support release](http://jenkins-ci.org/changelog-stable)\n* A modern web browser - to avoid unnecessary complexity when implementing the view layer I decided to use CSS 3 flexbox.\nThe standard is currently supported by [most modern web browsers](http://caniuse.com/flexbox), so if your browser doesn\'t support this feature - [consider upgrading](http://browsehappy.com/) :)\n\n## Your feedback matters!\n\nDo you find Build Monitor useful? Give it a star! &#9733;\n\nFound a bug? Raise [an issue](https://github.com/jan-molak/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin/issues?state=open)\nor submit a pull request ([start with this mini-dev guide](https://github.com/jan-molak/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin/wiki/Development-Guide), it might come in handy).\n\nHave feedback? Let me know on twitter: [@JanMolak](https://twitter.com/JanMolak)\n\n## Setting up\n\n![Setting up](docs/Setting_up.png)\n\nSimple, right? :-) You can have as many Build Monitor Views as you want - the most popular approach is to have one per team or one per project.\n\n# A picture is worth a thousand words\n\n![Adding jobs](docs/1_Adding_jobs.png)\n![Three columns view](docs/2_Three_columns_view.png)\n![Supports Claim and Build Failure Analyzer plugins](docs/3_Two_columns_view_with_claim_and_build_failure_analyzer_plugins.png)\n![Colour-blind mode](docs/4_Colour_blind_mode.png)\n\n## Roadmap and work in progress\n\nTo stay up-to-date with the project news - [follow @JanMolak on twitter](https://twitter.com/JanMolak).\n\nIf you\'d like to know what\'s coming next - have a look at the project\'s [kanban board](https://waffle.io/jan-molak/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin).\nHere\'s how the columns work:\n\n* Ideas - ideas up for discussion. If you\'d like to see any of them making it into the Build Monitor project - vote on them or submit a pull request.\n* Backlog - features most wanted by the Build Monitor Community. I\'ll get them done as soon as I have a spare moment. Feel free to help out! :-)\n* In progress - stuff I\'m currently working on and will make it into the next release.\n* Done - done and deployed. Grab the latest version from your Jenkins Update Centre or the [Releases](https://bitly.com/JBMReleases) page.\n\nIf you\'d like to get hold of the latest and greatest build of the Build Monitor Plugin\nbefore it\'s available in the Jenkins Update Centre, you can [download it](https://smartcode-opensource.ci.cloudbees.com/job/build-monitor/lastBuild/) from the [SmartCode Open-Source](http://bit.ly/SmartCodeOSCI) Jenkins CI server.\n\n## (A)TDD\n\nIf you\'d like to understand more about the logic behind the Build Monitor Plugin,\nhave a look at the [tests that drove the design](/build-monitor-plugin/src/test/java/com/smartcodeltd/jenkinsci/plugins).\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I let my teammates know that I\'m fixing a broken build?\n\nBy claiming it. Build Monitor supports Jenkins [Claim Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Claim+plugin), so once you have it installed, enable "Broken build claiming" in the "Post-build actions" of your Jenkins job. From now on you\'ll be able to claim any further broken builds and Build Monitor will pick it up.\n\nYou might also be interested in a [script](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Allow+broken+build+claiming+on+every+jobs) that enables claiming on all your Jenkins jobs.\n\n### How do I know what broke the build?\n\nWouldn\'t it be great to know _what_ made your build fail? Well of course it would. Build Monitor supports Jenkins [Build Failure Analyzer Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Failure+Analyzer) so get it, [teach it](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Failure+Analyzer#BuildFailureAnalyzer-Knowledgebase) and Build Monitor will tell you what the Failure Analyzer found out.\n\n### I have too many jobs on one screen, what should I do?\n\nYou have several options here:\n\n1. **review the granularity of your jobs**: If you have too many low-level jobs displayed on one screen, consider consolidating them using [Promoted Builds Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Promoted+Builds+Plugin) or [MultiJob Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Multijob+Plugin)\n1. **use job filters**: Build Monitor supports Jenkins [View Job Filters Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/View+Job+Filters), if you have it installed\n1. get a bigger screen ...\n\n### Red and green colours are lovely, but I\'m colour blind ...\nThere\'s a colour blind mode you can [enable in the Settings](https://github.com/jan-molak/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin/issues/30#issuecomment-35849019)\n\n## Open Source Software Used\n\n* [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/)\n* [Angular-slider](http://prajwalkman.github.io/angular-slider/)\n* Customised [Angular Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)\n* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) normalize.css\n* [OpenSans font](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) by Steve Matteson\n\n## Friends of Build Monitor\n\nBuild Monitor is continuously delivered to a Jenkins near you thanks to:\n* the time and commitment of [the author](http://smartcodeltd.co.uk/) and [the contributors](https://github.com/jan-molak/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin/graphs/contributors)\n* a battery of browsers provided by [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) and powering the [acceptance tests](/build-monitor-acceptance/src/test/java)\n\n[![tested on BrowserStack](docs/browserstack-logo.png)](http://bit.ly/JBMBS)\n'
