b'Vespene\n=======\n\nVespene is a reimagined build system and automation console, focused on ease of use and advanced\ncapabilities.\n\nVespene was designed with extremely large micro-service deployments in mind, but it equally usable\nfor all kinds of IT environments.\n\nWhile new, Vespene is growing quickly. All ideas for improvement are fair game!\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n* A horizontally-scalable, highly-available architecture built on Python, Django, and PostgreSQL\n* A well-organized, straight-forward user interface\n* Distributed workers\n* Declarative configuration via .vespene files (optional)\n* Built-in pipelines - no DSLs to learn, use easy .vespene YAML or set them up graphically\n* SSH-agent integration lending script access to encrypted SSH keys\n* A flexible variable system with Jinja2 templating and integration with any tool that can consume YAML/JSON\n* Webhooks and scheduled builds\n* Easy-to-configure access controls\n* Self-service automation panels for all types of users\n* Docker or sudo-based build isolation for security\n* Triggers to publish builds, run checks, or send messages to Slack\n* A plugin system where nearly everything is extensible - 8 types of plugins to date!\n* Easy administration, deployment, and upgrades\n\nStatus\n======\n\nCurrently Vespene is in "beta" status.\n\nYou should feel comfortable running off the master branch today, and reliable \ndatabase migrations are in place to enable easy upgrades.\n\nOur first release branch release will be in January of 2019, with new releases following approximately \nevery 3 months.\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nFor more on usage, capabilities, and setup, see [docs.vespene.io](http://docs.vespene.io).\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nThe Vespene code requires one or more Linux or Unix environments that can run Python 3, \nand a PostgreSQL server, which we can help you install.\n\nInstall automation is provided for the following platforms:\n\n* Ubuntu LTS distributions\n* CentOS 7 or RHEL 7\n* Arch Linux\n* openSUSE\n* OS X\n\nAutomation for other install types are being added frequently.\n\nInstallation Instructions\n=========================\n\nThe setup guide is [here](http://docs.vespene.io/setup.html).\n\nForum & GitHub\n==============\n\nIf you have an idea or question, we\'d encourage you to join the forum at [talk.msphere.io](http://talk.msphere.io).\nThis is the best place to ask all questions about the project. \n\nTo keep things organized, the issue tracker is just for bug tickets and pull requests.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nVespene is Apache2 licensed.\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nVespene is created and managed by Michael DeHaan <michael@michaeldehaan.net>.\n\n'
