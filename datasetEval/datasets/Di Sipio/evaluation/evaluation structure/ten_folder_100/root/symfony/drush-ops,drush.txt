b'Drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal. Drush core ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with code like modules/themes/profiles. Similarly, it runs update.php, executes SQL queries and DB migrations, and misc utilities like run cron or clear cache. Developers love the `generate` command, which jump starts your coding project by writing ready-to-customize PHP and YML files. Drush can be extended by [3rd party commandfiles](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module?f[2]=im_vid_3%3A4654).\n\n[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/drush/drush/v/stable.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/drush/drush) [![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/drush/drush/downloads.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/drush/drush) [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/drush/drush/license.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/drush/drush) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/drush/badge/?version=master)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/drush/?badge=master)\n\n| Isolation Tests | Functional Tests |\n| :-------------: | :--------------: |\n| <a href="https://travis-ci.org/drush-ops/drush"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/drush-ops/drush.svg?branch=master"></a> | <a href="https://circleci.com/gh/drush-ops/drush"><img src="https://circleci.com/gh/drush-ops/drush.svg?style=shield"></a> |\n\nResources\n-----------\n* [Installing (and Upgrading)](http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/)\n* [General Documentation](http://docs.drush.org)\n* [API Documentation](http://www.drush.org/api/master/index.html)\n* [Drush packages available via Composer](https://packagist.org/search/?type=drupal-drush)\n* [A list of modules that include Drush integration](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module?f[2]=im_vid_3%3A4654&solrsort=ds_project_latest_release+desc)\n* Drush comes with a [full test suite](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/master/tests/README.md) powered by [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit).
