b'Symfony PSR-6 implementation for caching\n========================================\n\nThis component provides an extended [PSR-6](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/)\nimplementation for adding cache to your applications. It is designed to have a\nlow overhead so that caching is fastest. It ships with a few caching adapters\nfor the most widespread and suited to caching backends. It also provides a\n`doctrine/cache` proxy adapter to cover more advanced caching needs and a proxy\nadapter for greater interoperability between PSR-6 implementations.\n\nResources\n---------\n\n  * [Documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/cache.html)\n  * [Contributing](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html)\n  * [Report issues](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues) and\n    [send Pull Requests](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pulls)\n    in the [main Symfony repository](https://github.com/symfony/symfony)\n'
