Follow the steps on-screen\n5. Have fun!\n\n### Dependencies\n\n**Remark**: If you are using GIT instead of composer create-project or the zip-file from [http://www.fork-cms.com](http://www.fork-cms.com), you\nshould install our dependencies. The dependencies are handled by [composer](http://getcomposer.org/)\n\nTo install the dependencies, you can run the command below in the document-root:\n\n\tcomposer install -o\n\n## Security\n\nIf you discover any security related issues, please email core@fork-cms.com instead of using the issue tracker.\n\n\n## SSL\n\nIf you want to activate https redirection, go into the .htaccess file and uncomment the lines about https.\n\n## Bugs\n\nIf you encounter any bugs, please create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/forkcms/forkcms/issues).\nIf you're stuck or would like to discuss Fork CMS, talk to us on [slack](https://fork-cms.herokuapp.com/)!\n\n## Running the tests\n\nWe use phpunit as a test framework. It's installed when using composer install.\nTo be able to run them, make sure you have a database with the same credentials as\nyour normal database and with the name suffixed with _test.\n\nBecause we support multiple php versions it gave some issues. Therefore we use the bridge from symfony.\n\nRunning the tests:\n\n    composer test\n\nRunning only the unit tests or the functional tests\n\n     composer test -- --testsuite=functional\n     composer test -- --testsuite=unit\n\n## Styling the backend\n\nThe backend uses [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) in combination with Sass. To make changes, you should make\nthe changes into the scss-files, and regenerate the real css with `gulp build`.\n\n## Yarn\n\nWe use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install our dependencies. For now we have a `gulp`-script that moves everything to\nthe correct directories. So if you change the dependencies, make sure you run `gulp build`.\n\n## Discussion\n\n- Slack: <https://fork-cms.herokuapp.com/>\n\n_The Fork CMS team_\n"
