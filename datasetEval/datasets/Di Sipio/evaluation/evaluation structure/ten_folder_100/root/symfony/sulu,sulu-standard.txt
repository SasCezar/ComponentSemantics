Use it as a CMS to develop and\nmanage enterprise multi-sites or as a development environment to create reliable\nand high-performant web-apps.\n\nWe use [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for cross browser testing.\n\n**Although Sulu is stable and already used in production it is still under\nheavy development. Therefore we can not guarantee full backwards compatibility\nat the current stage.**\n\n## Installation\n\nFor the install guide and reference, see:\n\n* [installation guide](http://docs.sulu.io/en/latest/book/getting-started.html)\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcome.
