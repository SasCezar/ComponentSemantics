b'# University of Waterloo - Humans vs Zombies\n\n## About\nThe latest UWaterloo HvZ website. Built on Django.\n\n## Dev Setup\n\nTo create a local instance of the site for development:\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:uwhumansvszombies/uwhvz.git\npipenv install\npipenv shell\npython manage.py migrate\npython manage.py runserver\n```\n\n## Useful things\n- `python manage.py seed_data` generates a bunch of fake data for testing purposes.\n- `python manage.py makemigrations app` to make a migration after changing models, etc.\n\n## Production Setup\n\n### General\nThe site is currently hosted on: Computer Science Club (CSC) servers.\n\nWe use a detached screen to run Gunicorn, which lets us run the site. Important commands include:\n- `screen -S gunicorn`: create a new screen to be detachable named "gunicorn"\n- `screen -ls`: should list exactly one detached screen where Gunicorn is running the site\n- `screen -r`: resumes the Gunicorn screen\n\nIf no screen is found, do the following:\n```bash\nscreen -S gunicorn\nsource venv/bin/activate\ngunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:53271 uwhvz.wsgi\n```\nExit out of the screen session (but keep it running) with `Ctrl+A+D`. **Failure to do this will make restarting the server significantly harder.** Afterwards, check if the website is online.\n\n### Assets\nIf frontend-related changes are not refreshed on the site originally upon `pull`ing, use `python manage.py collectstatic`, and restart the server. If that doesn\'t work, do the following:\n```bash\nrm -rf /static/\npython manage.py collectstatic\npython manage.py compress --engine jinja2\n``` \nThe last line is for optimizing the size of our assets. **Failure to run the last line will cause a 500 error.**\n\n## Contributing\n1.
