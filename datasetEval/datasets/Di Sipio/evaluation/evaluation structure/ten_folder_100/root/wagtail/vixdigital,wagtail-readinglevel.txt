b'# wagtail-readinglevel\nA lightweight Wagtail plugin to determine the reading level of text input into a rich text field.\n\nCurrently there are two available modes:\n1. (Default) Reading Age - calculated using the [Automated Readability Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index).\n2. SMOG Index - calculated the [SMOG Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMOG) (only suitable for English).\n3. Coleman-Liau Index - calculated using the [Coleman-Liau Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index).\n4. Flesch Score - calculated using the [Flesch Reading Ease forumal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) (only suitable for English).\n5.
