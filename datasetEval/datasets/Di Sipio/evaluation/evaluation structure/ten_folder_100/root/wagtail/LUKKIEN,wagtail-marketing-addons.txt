b'# About wagtail-marketing-addons\n\nAn (opinionated) overview of all pages and their corresponding promotion settings.\n\n## Use-case\n\nWhen dealing with large amounts of pages the content editor experience differs from a marketeer\'s editor experience. A marketeer would more likely want to see what page options were set for SEO and SEA purposes. In this case it can be quite a burden to go through the page explorer, verifying whether the page title, SEO title and search description were set properly.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe SEO Listing within the `wagtail-marketing-addons` will show: \n\n* An overview of all pages in a single list;\n* Relevant properties: page title, SEO title, search description;\n* A preview what it could look like in a search engine;\n* A basic score indicating how this would perform in terms of word and character count.\n\n![wagtail-marketing-addons screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LUKKIEN/wagtail-marketing-addons/master/.github/overview.jpg)\n\n## Things to consider\n\nAs stated this plugin contains an opinionated perspective on how you would handle your HTML rendering. With this use-case and solution we\'re assuming the following rationale on your page:\n\n```html\n<title>{% if self.seo_title %}{{ self.seo_title }}{% else %}{{ self.title }}{% endif %} | Your Site</title>\n<meta name="description" content="{% if self.search_description %}{{ self.search_description }}{% endif %}">\n```\n\nIn this case your SEO title (when filled in) has a greater priority over the Page Title.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information on getting started, an overview of all available settings and the rationale behind the scoring mechanism please see [our documentation on Read the Docs](https://wagtail-marketing-addons.readthedocs.io).\n\n---\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LUKKIEN/wagtail-marketing-addons.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LUKKIEN/wagtail-marketing-addons)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/wagtail-marketing-addons/badge/?version=latest)](https://wagtail-marketing-addons.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/wagtail-marketing-addons.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/wagtail-marketing-addons)\n![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/lukkien/wagtail-marketing-addons.svg)\n'
