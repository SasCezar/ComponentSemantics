b"Oscar Wagtail demo project\n==========================\n\n**A Django recipe for integrating [Oscar E-commerce](http://oscarcommerce.com) into a [Wagtail CMS](http://wagtail.io) application.**\n\n*We do __not__ recommend using this project to start your own site*. This recipe is only to provide some examples of implementing common features, it is not an exemplar of Django, Oscar or Wagtail best practice.\n\nIf you're reasonably new to Python/Django, we suggest you run this project on a Virtual Machine using Vagrant, which helps resolve common software dependency issues. However instructions to start this project without Vagrant follow below.\n\nSetup with Vagrant\n------------------\n\n### Dependencies\n* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)\n* [Vagrant 1.5+](https://www.vagrantup.com)\n\n### Installation\nRun the following commands:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/LUKKIEN/oscar-wagtail-demo.git\n    cd oscar-wagtail-demo\n    vagrant up\n    vagrant ssh\n      (then, within the SSH session:)\n    ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000\n\nThe demo site will now be accessible at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/), the Wagtail admin interface at [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/) and the Oscar dashboard interface at [http://localhost:8000/dashboard/](http://localhost:8000/dashboard/). Log into them with the credentials ``admin / changeme``.\n\nSetup without Vagrant\n-----\nDon't want to set up a whole VM to try out Wagtail? No problem.\n\n### Dependencies\n* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) or [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)\n* [PIP](https://github.com/pypa/pip)\n\n### Installation\n\nWith PostgreSQL running (and configured to allow you to connect as the 'postgres' user - if not, you'll need to adjust the `createdb` line and the database settings in wagtaildemo/settings/base.py accordingly), run the following commands:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/LUKKIEN/oscar-wagtail-demo.git\n    cd oscar-wagtail-demo\n    virtualenv .\n    source bin/activate\n    createdb -Upostgres oscarwagtaildemo\n    make develop\n    ./manage.py runserver\n\nThe `make develop` command combines:\n* `make clean` cleaning any compiled Python files\n* `make install` installing dependencies via `pip` package manager\n* `make migrations` performing `./manage migrations` to perform database migrations\n* `make fixtures` load both Wagtail and Oscar fixtures and perform `update_index`\n* `make superuser` create superuser (you'll be prompted for username, e-mail address and password)\n\nThe demo site will now be accessible at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/), the Wagtail admin interface at [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/) and the Oscar dashboard interface at [http://localhost:8000/dashboard/](http://localhost:8000/dashboard/). Log into them with the credentials inserted in earlier step.\n\n### SQLite support\n\nSQLite is supported as an alternative to PostgreSQL - update the `DATABASES` setting in wagtaildemo/settings/base.py to use `'django.db.backends.sqlite3'` and set `NAME` to be the full path of your database file, as you would with a regular Django project.\n\nContributors\n------------\n - [Peter Govers](https://github.com/pgovers) ([Lukkien](https://www.lukkien.com))\n - [Coen van der Kamp](https://github.com/allcaps) ([Four Digits](https://www.fourdigits.nl))\n - [Henk-Jan van Hasselaar](https://github.com/Henk-JanVanHasselaar) ([Lukkien](https://www.lukkien.com))\n - [Ludolf Takens](https://github.com/ltakens) ([Four Digits](https://www.fourdigits.nl))\n"
