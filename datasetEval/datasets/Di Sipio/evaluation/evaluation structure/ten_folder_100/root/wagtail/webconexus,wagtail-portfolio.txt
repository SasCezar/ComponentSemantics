b"# Wagtail Onepage Portfolio Starter\n\nA simple portfolio page made with Wagtail and Bootstrap4. Supports multilanguage. Nothing is hardcoded, everything can be adjusted through Wagtail admin.\n\nView the demo here: https://rafrasenberg.nl\n\n## Features\n- Bootstrap 4\n- Multilanguage with the Wagtailtrans extension\n- jQuery filters for your portfolio items\n- Google Analytics tracking code support\n- Wagtail-metadata & Django-environ\n\n\n## Prerequisites\nPython3 and virtualenv installed on your localmachine or server. There is enough you can find about that on Google.\n\n## To install:\n\n1. Create a virtual env: ```virtualenv -p python3 wagtail-portfolio```\n2. Activate virtual env: ```source wagtail-portfolio/bin/activate```\n3. Create src folder: ```mkdir src``` and cd into new folder with ```cd src```\n4. Use ``` Git clone https://github.com/webconexus/wagtail-portfolio.git ```\n5. ```cd wagtail-portfolio``` and use ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```\n6. From your root directory go to portfolio --> settings --> and change the .env.example to .env with your own preferred variables. I included a secretkey and debug=on so if you don't know how it works just change the name to .env and the app should run.\n7. Use command ``` django m ``` to migrate database. Added django-shortcuts to requirements to make life easier :)\n8. Use command ``` django mm ```\n9. Use command ``` django m ``` again, extra steps for the translation package.\n10. Use command ```django csu``` (Create superuser)\n11. Now run your server with ```django r```\n12. Congratz you have your wagtail-portfolio running. You should see the wagtail welcome message when you enter the homepage. You should now go to admin and login with your credentials you just made. Here we have to configure some multilanguage options so our template gets rendered.\n\n\n## How to setup multi language pages\n1. Go to Settings --> Languages --> Add language\n2. Set a default language by clicking is default there (English in my case), add other languages you prefer, but there always has to be one default language.\n3. Go to pages, click the top part (pages) you end up in a screen which says Root.\n4. Here you add the root translatable page (click add child page). Add any title you like\n5. You should see two pages now, the default Wagtail and your own page. Delete the wagtail page. (Hover --> more, delete)\n6. Now head over to Settings --> Sites, this should be empty now.\n7. Click add site, with hostname: localhost and a name you prefer. !IMPORTANT! Check the default page option, otherwise it won't render.\n8. Now head over to pages and click add child page. Here you can enter all your information. The Wagtailtrans module automatically creates a different page in your chosen language. You can head over to the promote tab to change the slug. The most obvious one is your language code, so domain.com/en domain.com/nl etc.\n\nThat's it! Just add your content and you are ready to go.\n\n## Some tips:\n- Social media buttons, portfolio items, categories and the counters can be added through the snippets tab in Wagtail admin.\n- The categories you create as a snippet will be the jQuery filters on the front-end. These categories are connected with the portfolio items.\n- Analytics code can be added through settings --> Google Analytics.\n\nPlease feel free to use it. If you run into any issues you can file an issue and I will try to resolve it.\n"
