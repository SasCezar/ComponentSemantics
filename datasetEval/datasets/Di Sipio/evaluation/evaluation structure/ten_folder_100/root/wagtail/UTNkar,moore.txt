b"# Project Moore\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UTNkar/moore.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/UTNkar/moore)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/UTNkar/moore/badge.svg?branch=development)](https://coveralls.io/github/UTNkar/moore?branch=development)\n\nProject Moore is a replacement for many of the [UTN](https://utn.se/) web\napplications. Built using [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) and the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework, Project\nMoore intends to replace obfuscated custom applications. This is why this\nproject keeps a high regard to programming practice and documentation.\n\nAny questions about the project can be send to the [UTN system\nadministrator](mailto:admin@utn.se).\n\nBefore contributing please read through our [contribution\nguidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Getting Started - Virtual Environment\n\nTo get started with Project Moore, follow these instructions to set up a\ndevelopment environment:\n\n1. Install Python 3, at least version 3.5 or up.\n2. Install the following python packages:\n   - python3-venv\n   - python3-dev\n3. Clone the repository.\n4. Run `source ./source_me.sh` to create a virtual environment.\n4. Run `pip install --upgrade pip` to make sure that pip is running the latest version\n5. Run `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`\n6. Use `cd src` to enter the website directory.\n7. Run `./manage.py migrate` to initialize the database.\n8. Run `./manage.py createsuperuser` to create an admin user.\n\nDuring development, you can run a test web server using `./manage.py\nrunserver`.\n\n## Getting Started - Docker\n\nIf you can use Docker, there is an alternative way to get your development\nenvironment all set up:\n\n1. Clone the repository.\n2. Run `docker -t moore .` to create the moore image.\n3. Run `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd):/var/www/moore/ --name moore moore` to\nstart a new docker container.\n4. Run `docker exec -it moore python src/manage.py migrate` to initialize the\ndatabase\n5. Run `docker exec -it moore python src/ createsuperuser` to create an admin\nuser.\n\nThe Moore application is now available on `http://localhost:8000` and can be started\nand stopped using `docker start moore` and `docker stop moore`.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for Project Moore is split up into two parts. All documentation\nregarding Project Moore's code base is located within the code. Like the rest\nof the UTN infrastructure, a global overview of the application is documented\non [docs.utn.se](https://docs.utn.se/)\n\n## Testing\n\nAll code in this repository is tested in two ways: we use [Django test\nsuites](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/testing/) and we run the\n[flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) style enforcer. Together they can\npromote clean and good code.\n\nThese tests are run automatically using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).\nIf, however, you want to run these tests locally you can run the following\ncommands in the project root directory:\n\n- `./src/manage.py test src` - to test with our Django test suites\n- `flake8 src` - to run the flake8 style enforcer\n\n## Translating\n\nProject Moore intends to be multilingual. The web application is available in\nboth Swedish and English. Whenever any translatable text is added or changed it\nshould be translated using translation files.\n\n*Within Project Moore we use American English.*\n\nTo create translations for an app:\n\n1. `cd src/<appname>`\n1. `../manage.py makemessages -l sv`\n2. This will create or update the files under `src/<appname>/locale/`.\n3. Use poedit (or your favourite tool -- please do not use a plain text editor\nsince those cannot handle all the subtleties) to fix the translations.\n4. `../manage.py compilemessages`\n\n## License\n\n[AGPL-v2.0](LICENSE), unless a different, usually external, license is provided within a folder or file.\n"
