b"# Wagtail Draftjs Reading Time\n\nAn example implementation of the [draftail reading time component](https://github.com/springload/draftail/blob/master/examples/components/ReadingTime.js) using draftail's registerControl function.\n\n!! This is an experimental build meant to test yet unreleased api features in Wagtail. It uses a monkeypatch to work specifically with Wagtail 2.0 and will likely break in a future release of Wagtail. !!\n\n![Screenshot](screenshot.jpg)\n\n## Installation\n- ```pip install wagtail-readingtime```\n- Add 'readingtime' to your list of installed apps AFTER all wagtail app includes (e.g. wagtail.admin, wagtail.core etc). \n  \n## Usage\nOnce installed You will see the reading time calculation displayed in the toolbar of all rich text fields in your Wagtail admin area."
