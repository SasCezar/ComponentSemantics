b'**!! WARNING: This repo isn\'t maintained anymore !!**\n\nOverriding Wagtail CSS isn\'t sustainable and makes upgrading to a newer version more difficult.\nDesigners are now more closely involved with the development of Wagtail (e.g. see the `Streamfield UI Changes <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/3942>`_) so we are confident that hacks like this project are no longer needed.\n\nWagtail Facelift\n================\n\n    Drop-in CSS enhancements for Wagtail\'s Streamfield. Pure CSS overrides, there\'s no extra configuration.\n    \nCheck out `Awesome Wagtail <https://github.com/springload/awesome-wagtail>`_ for more awesome packages and resources from the Wagtail community.\n\n.. image:: ./facelift.png\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wagtailfacelift\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/springload/wagtailfacelift.git\n\n\nAdd the application to your installed apps:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        \'wagtail\',\n        \'wagtailfacelift\'\n    ]\n\n\n---\n\nExtra theming\n-------------\n\n`.multi-field-dark`\n\nApply this class to your widget for a subtle background shift, eg:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    MultiFieldPanel([\n        StreamFieldPanel(\'heroes\'),\n        ],\n        heading="Homepage Heroes",\n        classname="collapsible collapsed multi-field-dark"\n    )\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n'
