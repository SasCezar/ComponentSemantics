The setup and configuration have been designed\nto be as simple but also provide the best features;\nNo complex serializers need to be written - just add a `graphql_fields` list\nto your model and away you go (although if you want to go deeper you can!).\n\n#### Features:\n* Easily create GraphQL types by adding a small annotation in your models.\n* Supports traditional Wagtail models:\n    - Pages (including Streamfield & Orderables)\n    - Snippets\n    - Images\n    - Documents\n    - Settings\n    - Search (on all models)\n* Custom Image & Document model support\n* Advanced headless preview functionality buit using GraphQL Subscriptions to enable Page previews on any device!\n* Gatsby Image support (both base64 and SVG tracing)! :fire:\n\n\n### Built With\nThis library is an abstraction upon and relies heavily on Graphene & Graphene Django.\nWe also use Django Channels and the Potrace image library.\n* [Graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene)\n* [Graphene Django](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene)\n* [Django Channels](https://github.com/django/channels)\n* [Potrace](https://github.com/skyrpex/potrace)\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGetting Grapple installed is designed to be as simple as possible!\n\n### Prerequisites\n```\nDjango  >= 2.2, <2.3\nwagtail >= 2.5, <2.7\n```\n\n### Installation\n`pip install wagtail_grapple`\n\n<br />\n\nAdd the following to the `installed_apps` list in your Wagtail settings file:\n\n```python\ninstalled_apps = [\n    ...\n    "grapple",\n    "graphene_django",\n    "channels",\n    ...\n]\n```\n\n<br />\n\nAdd the following to the bottom of the same settings file, where each key is the app you want to this library to scan and the value is the prefix you want to give to GraphQL types (you can usually leave this blank):\n\n```python\n# Grapple Config:\nGRAPHENE = {"SCHEMA": "grapple.schema.schema"}\nGRAPPLE_APPS = {\n    "home": ""\n}\n```\n\n<br />\n\nAdd the GraphQL URLs to your `urls.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom grapple import urls as grapple_urls\n...\nurlpatterns = [\n    ...\n    url(r"", include(grapple_urls)),\n    ...\n]\n```\n\n<br/>\nDone! Now you can proceed onto configuring your models to generate GraphQL types that adopt their stucture :tada:\n_Your graphql endpoint is available at http://localhost:8000/graphql/_\n<br/>\n\n## Usage\n\nHere is a GraphQL model configuration for the default page from the Wagtail docs:\n```python\n...\nfrom grapple.models import (\n    GraphQLString,\n    GraphQLStreamfield,\n)\n\nclass BlogPage(Page):\n    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    date = models.DateField("Post date")\n    body = StreamField(\n        [\n            ("heading", blocks.CharBlock(classname="full title")),\n            ("paraagraph", blocks.RichTextBlock()),\n            ("image", ImageChooserBlock()),\n        ]\n    )\n\n    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [\n        FieldPanel("author"),\n        FieldPanel("date"),\n        StreamFieldPanel("body"),\n    ]\n\n    # Note these fields below:\n    graphql_fields = [\n        GraphQLString("heading"),\n        GraphQLString("date"),\n        GraphQLString("author"),\n        GraphQLStreamfield("body"),\n    ]\n```\n\n_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://wagtail-grapple.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)_\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create.
