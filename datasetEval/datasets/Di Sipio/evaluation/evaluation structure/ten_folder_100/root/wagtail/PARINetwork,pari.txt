b'![N|Solid](https://ruralindiaonline.org/static/img/logo.png)\r\n\r\n# People\'s Archive of Rural India\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PARINetwork/pari.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PARINetwork/pari)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis repository contains the source code of the main website deployed for public consumption at ruralindiaonline.org\r\n\r\n## Developer Guide\r\n\r\n### Pre-requisites\r\n\r\n* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)\r\n* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)\r\n* [Ansible(v2.2.1)](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html)\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nClone both [pari](https://github.com/PARINetwork/pari.git) and [pari-ansible](https://github.com/PARINetwork/pari-ansible.git) repositories (ideally in the same parent directory).\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/PARINetwork/pari.git\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/PARINetwork/pari-ansible.git\r\n$ cd pari\r\n$ vagrant up   # You\'ll be prompted for SUDO password of your host machine for the first time.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Ansible 2.2.1\r\nMake sure that you have installed Ansible 2.2.1.\r\nYou can install Ansible 2.2.1 with the following command\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ pip install ansible==2.2.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf, however, you have already installed some other version of Ansible you will need to uninstall it\r\n```sh\r\n$ sudo -H pip uninstall ansible\r\n$ #OR\r\n$ brew uninstall ansible # Only if you used homebrew to install ansible\r\n$ pip install ansible==2.2.1\r\n$ git checkout master\r\n$ git pull \r\n$ rm -rf pari_env (if present)\r\n$ vagrant destroy ( Delete the old version of the box )\r\n$ rm -rf .vagrant (Delete old vagrant cache)\r\n$ vagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Development-specific commands\r\nThe above set-up will get the vagrant box up. That is, it will start the virtual machine that pretends to be a remote server at "development.ruralindiaonline.org". The django development server also will be started and available at the same URL. You should see a working PARI installation at [http://development.ruralindiaonline.org](http://development.ruralindiaonline.org).\r\n\r\nTo work with your django environment, you will need to login via ssh into this pretend-remote virtual machine and  follow the following steps for this.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ vagrant ssh                                     # Login to vagrant box\r\n$ cd /vagrant && source ~/pari_env/bin/activate   # Change to project directory and activate project virtualenv\r\n$ python manage.py runserver                      # Local instance available at development.ruralindiaonline.org\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdmin console can be accessed at [http://development.ruralindiaonline.org/admin/](http://development.ruralindiaonline.org/admin/) (username: admin, password: admin)\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ python manage.py shell                        # Access django shell\r\n$ python manage.py dbshell                      # Access postgres DB. Password: pari\r\n$ python manage.py test --keepdb                # Run all the tests\r\n$ deactivate                                    # Exit from project virtualenv\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tech stack:\r\n\r\n[Python](https://www.python.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/), [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)\r\n\r\n## How to Contribute?\r\n#### Sign up for stories\r\nChoose any card in **Ready for Dev** lane from [Github Projects](https://github.com/PARINetwork/pari/projects/1) and assign it to yourself.
