b"# 3D hex tile system\n\n![screenshot](hex-grid.jpg)\n\nI never found a good (and free!) library for creating perfect hexagons and arranging them in a grid. But I did find [Amit's wonderful explanation](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/), and finally had the time to throw something together.\n\nYou can use the `Board` class with different graph types (hex and square), or you can make your own if you implement the interface.\n\nPlease use this to make awesome hex-based web games. Or port the code and make awesome hex games there. Just make awesome hex games, ok?\n\n## Features\n\n- Simple API for attaching objects to the grid through `Board.js`\n- **A* pathfinding** with or without weighted nodes, and a `walkable` flag\n- Make maps with [the editor](http://vonwolfehaus.github.io/von-grid/editor/) (autosaves to localstorage, and save/load as `.json` files)\n- Varied height\n- Sparse maps\n- **Mouse interaction** with the grid's cells (over, out, down, up, click, wheel)\n- Programmatic geometry, allow you to precisely adjust every aspect of the hexagon\n- Square grid that can be used interchangeably\n- Include only the hex grid by downloading `dist/hex-grid.js`, or all grid types with `von-grid.js`, etc\n\n#### Roadmap\n\n- Improved editor\n- Improved API\n- Abstract grid\n\n## Usage\n\n#### Basic board\n\n![screenshot](hex-grid-basic.jpg)\n\n```javascript\nvar scene = new vg.Scene({ // I made a very handy util for creating three.js scenes quickly\n\tcameraPosition: {x:0, y:150, z:150}\n}, true); // 'true' or a config object adds orbit controls\n\nvar grid = new vg.HexGrid();\n\ngrid.generate({\n\tsize: 4\n});\n\nvar board = new vg.Board(grid);\n\nboard.generateTilemap();\n\nscene.add(board.group);\nscene.focusOn(board.group);\n\nupdate();\n\nfunction update() {\n\tscene.render();\n\trequestAnimationFrame(update);\n}\n```\n\n#### Examples\n\nFor the simple examples you can drop them into Chrome, but for ones that require images or models, you'll have to run `gulp serve-examples`. A browser tab will be opened to the examples directory for you.\n\n## Editor\n\n#### [Try it out](http://vonwolfehaus.github.io/von-grid/editor/)\n\n![screenshot](editor.png)\n"
