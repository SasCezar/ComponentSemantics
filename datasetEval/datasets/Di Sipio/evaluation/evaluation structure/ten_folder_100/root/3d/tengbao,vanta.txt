b'# Vanta JS\n\n## [View demo gallery & customize effects at www.vantajs.com &rarr;](https://www.vantajs.com)\n\n[![alt text](https://www.vantajs.com/gallery/vanta-preview.gif "Vanta JS")](https://www.vantajs.com)\n\n\n\n## What is Vanta? / FAQs\n\n- **Add 3D animated digital art to any webpage with just a few lines of code.**\n- Think of it as wrapper around a digital artwork that allows it to be inserted into an HTML element as a background.\n- Effects can interact with mouse/touch inputs.\n- Effect parameters (e.g. color) can be easily modified to match your brand.\n- Effects are powered by [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) (using WebGL) or [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js).\n- Total additional filesize is ~120kb minified and gzipped (mostly three.js), which is smaller than comparable background images/videos.\n- Vanta includes many pre-defined effects to try out. *More effects will be added soon!*\n\n## [View demo gallery & customize effects at www.vantajs.com &rarr;](https://www.vantajs.com)\n\n## Basic usage:\n\n```html\n<script src="three.min.js"></script>\n<script src="vanta.waves.min.js"></script>\n<script>\n  VANTA.WAVES(\'#my-background\')\n</script>\n```\n\n[View fiddle &rarr;](https://jsfiddle.net/xb74q5h1/)\n\n## More options:\n\n```js\nVANTA.WAVES({\n  el: \'#my-background\', // element id or DOM object reference\n  color: 0x000000,\n  waveHeight: 20,\n  shininess: 50,\n  waveSpeed: 1.5,\n  zoom: 0.75\n})\n```\n\nEach effect has different parameters. Explore them all!\n\n## Updating options after init:\n\n```js\nconst effect = VANTA.WAVES({\n  el: \'#my-background\',\n  color: 0x000000\n})\n\n// Later, when you want to update an animation in progress\neffect.update({\n  color: 0xff88cc\n})\n```\n\n## Cleanup:\n\n```js\nconst effect = VANTA.WAVES(\'#my-background\')\neffect.destroy() // e.g. call this in React\'s componentWillUnmount\n```\n\n## Usage with React Hooks (requires React 16.8):\n\nImport `vanta.xxxxx.min.js` as follows. Make sure `three.js` or `p5.js` has already been included via <script> tag.\n\n```js\nimport React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from \'react\'\nimport BIRDS from \'./vanta.birds.min.js\'\n// Make sure window.THREE is defined, e.g. by including three.min.js in the document head using a <script> tag\n\nconst MyComponent = (props) => {\n  const [vantaEffect, setVantaEffect] = useState(0)\n  const myRef = useRef(null)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!vantaEffect) {\n      setVantaEffect(BIRDS({\n        el: myRef.current\n      }))\n    }\n    return () => {\n      if (vantaEffect) vantaEffect.destroy()\n    }\n  }, [vantaEffect])\n  return <div ref={myRef}>\n    Foreground content goes here\n  </div>\n}\n```\n\n## Usage with React Classes:\n\n```js\nimport React from \'react\'\nimport BIRDS from \'./vanta.birds.min.js\'\n// Make sure window.THREE is defined, e.g. by including three.min.js in the document head using a <script> tag\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super()\n    this.vantaRef = React.createRef()\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.vantaEffect = BIRDS({\n      el: this.vantaRef.current\n    })\n  }\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    if (this.vantaEffect) this.vantaEffect.destroy()\n  }\n  render() {\n    return <div ref={this.myRef}>\n      Foreground content goes here\n    </div>\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Using THREE from npm\n\nYou can also import `three` from npm, and pass it into the effect constructor.\n\n```js\nimport React from \'react\'\nimport * as THREE from \'three\'\nimport BIRDS from \'./vanta.birds.min.js\'\n\n...\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.vantaEffect = BIRDS({\n      el: this.vantaRef.current,\n      THREE: THREE // use a custom THREE when initializing\n    })\n  }\n\n```\n\n## Local dev:\n\nClone the repo, run `npm install` and `npm run dev`, and go to localhost:8080.\n\n## Credits\n\n- General inspiration from [shadertoy.com](https://www.shadertoy.com), [#generative](https://www.twitter.com/hashtag/generative), [/r/generative](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/), [/r/creativecoding](https://www.reddit.com/r/creativecoding/), etc\n\n- Birds effect from https://threejs.org/examples/?q=birds#webgl_gpgpu_birds by @zz85\n- Fog effect from https://thebookofshaders.com/13/ by @patriciogonzalezvivo\n- Clouds effect from https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XslGRr by Inigo Quilez\n- Clouds2 effect from https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lsBfDz by Rune Stubbe\n- Trunk, Topology effects from http://generated.space/ by Kjetil Midtgarden Golid @kgolid\n'
