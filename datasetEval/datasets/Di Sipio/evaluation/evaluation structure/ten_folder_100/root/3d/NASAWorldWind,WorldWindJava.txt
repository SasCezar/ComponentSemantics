NASA will continue to release updates to the WorldWind SDKs, and will continue to make the WorldWind Servers accessible for all Users.  We plan to make an announcement soon regarding a path forward for improved support of the WorldWind User & Developer communities. \n\nIf you have questions and/or concerns, please feel free to email at:\n\nworldwind-info@lists.nasa.gov\n\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava)\n\n3D virtual globe API for desktop Java, developed by NASA. Provides a geographic context with high-resolution terrain, for visualizing geographic or geo-located information in 3D and 2D. Developers can customize the globe\'s terrain and imagery. Provides a collection of shapes for displaying and interacting with geographic data and representing a range of geometric objects.\n\n- [worldwind.arc.nasa.gov](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov) has setup instructions, developers guides, API documentation and more\n- [WorldWind Forum](https://forum.worldwindcentral.com) provides help from the WorldWind community\n- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) is used by the NASA WorldWind development team\n\n## Releases and Roadmap\n\nOfficial WorldWind Java releases have the latest stable features, enhancements and bug fixes ready for production use.\n\n- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava/releases/) documents official releases\n- [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava/milestones) documents upcoming releases and the development roadmap\n- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava) provides continuous integration and build automation\n\n## Run a Demo\n\n###### From a Web Browser\n\n- [WorldWind Demo App](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/latest/webstart/ApplicationTemplate.jnlp) shows WorldWind\'s basic capabilities\n- [Java Demos](https://goworldwind.org/demos) has a complete list of example apps\n\n###### From a Windows Development Environment\n\n- Download and extract the [Latest Release](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava/releases/latest)\n- Open the Command Prompt\n```bash\ncd [WorldWind release]\nrun-demo.bat\n```\n\n###### From a Linux or macOS Development Environment\n\n- Download and extract the [Latest Release](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava/releases/latest)\n- Open the Terminal app\n```bash\ncd [WorldWind release]\nsh run-demo.bash\n```\n\n###### Troubleshooting\n\nWorldWind requires a modern graphics card with a current driver. Most display problems are caused by out-of-date\ngraphics drivers. On Windows, visit your graphics card manufacturer\'s web site for the latest driver: NVIDIA, ATI or\nIntel. The drivers are typically under a link named Downloads or Support. If you\'re using a laptop, the latest drivers\nare found at the laptop manufacturer\'s web site.\n\n## JOGL Native Binaries\n\nJOGL performs runtime extraction of native binaries. Some deployment situations may not allow this because it extracts\nthe binaries to the application user\xe2\x80\x99s temp directory. Runtime extraction can be avoided by by modifying WorldWind\nJava\'s JOGL distribution to load native binaries directly from the library path instead of dynamically using the native\nbinary JAR files as follows:\n\n1. Extract the GlueGen and JOGL native binary JAR files for the desired platform.\n   These JAR files follow the naming pattern gluegen-rt-natives-PLATFORM.jar and jogl-all-natives-PLATFORM.jar\n2. Place the extracted native binaries either in the program\'s working directory or in a location specified as the\n   library path. The following JOGL user\'s guide page outlines supported library path variables:\n   https://jogamp.org/jogl/doc/userguide/index.html#traditionallibraryloading\n3. Remove the GlueGen and JOGL native binary JAR files from your application\'s workspace.\n   JOGL attempts to use the native binary JAR files before loading from the library path, so these files must not be\n   deployed with the application.\n4. When running, specify the JVM argument -Djogamp.gluegen.UseTempJarCache=false\n\n## License\n\n    NASA WORLDWIND\n\n    Copyright (C) 2001 United States Government\n    as represented by the Administrator of the\n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n    All Rights Reserved.\n\n    NASA OPEN SOURCE AGREEMENT VERSION 1.3\n\n    This open source agreement ("agreement") defines the rights of use, reproduction,\n    distribution, modification and redistribution of certain computer software originally\n    released by the United States Government as represented by the Government Agency\n    listed below ("Government Agency").
