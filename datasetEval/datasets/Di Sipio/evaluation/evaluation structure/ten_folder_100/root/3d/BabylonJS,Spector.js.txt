b'[SpectorJS](readme.md)\n=========\n\n## Summary\n**Explore and Troubleshoot your WebGL scenes (All engines and Vanilla script support) with ease.**\n\nSpector is a tool aimed at *WebGl* developers wanting to know what happens in their context. It enables capturing of all the available information from a frame. You will be able to look at your entire **commands list** with their associated **visual states** and **context information**.\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Spector.js/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Spector.js/actions)\n[![devDependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/babylonjs/spectorjs/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/babylonjs/spectorjs?type=dev)\n\nThis can be used either as a *browser extension* or directly from your page with a *Standalone Version*.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://spectordoc.babylonjs.com/pictures/title.png" style="width:512px">\n</p>\n\n## Table of Content\n* [Why](#why)\n* [Browser extension](#browser-extension)\n* [Use as a Module](#use-as-a-module)\n  * [Webpack sample](#webpack-sample)\n* [Use as a Script Reference](#use-as-a-script-reference)\n  * [CDN](#cdn)\n  * [From the repository](#repo)\n  * [Node_Modules](#node_modules)\n  * [How To Reference](#how-to-reference)\n* [Basic usage](#basic-usage)\n* [Custom data](#custom-data)\n* [Available APIs](documentation/apis.md)\n* [Build Locally](documentation/build.md)\n* [Contribute](documentation/contribute.md)\n* [ChangeLog](documentation/changeLogs.md)\n* [Learn WebGl](#learn-about-webgl)\n\n## Why\n###### [Back to top](#table-of-content)\nAs a core member of the BabylonJS team I often found the need to debug what was happening to my webgl context. I was a huge fan of webgl inspector until we introduced WebGl2 in Babylon. As the WebGL community as a whole is our focus, I thought it would be great to share an extension compatible with all the Webgl/Webgl2 engines available.\n\nYou can use the library inside of your own application easily as it is transpiled as a UMD module. It will either work as a script reference or with your favorite bundling tools like webpack.\n\n## Browser extension\n###### [Back to top](#table-of-content)\nIf you are willing to use the browser extension, you can direclty install it from the store:\n- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spectorjs/denbgaamihkadbghdceggmchnflmhpmk)\n- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/spector-js/)\n\nYou can find on [Real Time Rendering](http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/debugging-webgl-with-spectorjs/) a complete tutorial about the [Spector extension](http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/debugging-webgl-with-spectorjs/). Else, you can refer to the [extension documentation](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Spector.js/blob/release/documentation/extension.md#how-to-use) to learn how to use it.\n\nOr you can take a look at the following documentation to load it from the source: [Browser Extension](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Spector.js/tree/master/documentation/extension.md).\n\n<p align="center">\n    <img src="https://spectordoc.babylonjs.com/pictures/extensionPopup.png" style="width:256px" width="256px">\n</p>\n\n## Use as a Module\n###### [Back to top](#table-of-content)\nIn order to install the library in your application directory, please type the following command on a command line prompt open on the application directory:\n\n```\nnpm install spectorjs\n```\n\nFrom this point you are all set to use it in your app.\n\n### Webpack sample\n###### [Back to top](#table-of-content)\nAs a quick demo, here is a simple way to use the spector module with webpack.\n\nPlease follow the instructions below to create a new directory and install the required tools:\n\n```\nmkdir sample\ncd sample\nnpm init\nnpm install webpack --save-dev\nnpm install spectorjs --save-dev\n```\n\nFollowing the HelloWorld example from Webpack, you can now create it in the sample folder:\n\nA js file named entry.js containing the following code:\n\n```javascript\nvar SPECTOR = require("spectorjs");\n\nvar spector = new SPECTOR.Spector();\nspector.displayUI();\n```\n\nAnd an html file named index.js containing the following code:\n\n```html\n<html>\n    <head>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <script type="text/javascript" src="bundle.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNow your application is ready. Go back to your command line and bundle the javascript file:\n\n```\nwebpack entry.js bundle.js\n```\n\nYou are all set. You can open your index.html file and see the inspector running. It obviously won\'t be that usefull on an empty page but at least you get the integration idea.\n\n## Use as a Script Reference\n###### [Back to top](#table-of-content)\n\n### CDN\nFeel free to leverage the CDN to use the library from your own projets: [https://spectorcdn.babylonjs.com/spector.bundle.js](https://spectorcdn.babylonjs.com/spector.bundle.js)\n\n### Repo\nIf you prefer to host your own version, the library is available in the [dist](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Spector.js/blob/master/dist/spector.bundle.js) folder of the repo.\n\n### node_modules\nIf you used npm to install the library you can find the spector.bundle.js file in the node_module/spectorjs/dist folder.\n\n### How To Reference\nSimply add the following tag in your html page header:\n\n```html\n<script type="text/javascript" src="https://spectorcdn.babylonjs.com/spector.bundle.js"></script>\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n###### [Back to top](#table-of-content)\nOnce available in your app, you can instantiate an inspector by inserting the following command in your script:\n\n```javascript\nvar spector = new SPECTOR.Spector();\n```\n\nYou can then display the embedded UI directly in your page:\n\n```javascript\nspector.displayUI();\n```\n\nOr launch a capture and reuse its JSON result at your will:\n\n```javascript\nspector.onCapture.add((capture) => {\n    // Do something with capture.\n    var myEvent = new CustomEvent("SpectorOnCaptureEvent", { detail: { captureString: JSON.stringify(capture) } });\n    document.dispatchEvent(myEvent);\n});\n\nvar canvas = document.getElementById("renderCanvas");\nspector.captureCanvas(canvas);\n```\n\nAnother api you can rely upon is:\n\n```javascript\nspector.spyCanvases();\n```\n\nThis will enable a complete tracking of the gl calls even before capturing which enables for instance access to the texture inputs or memory consumption information.\n\n## Custom Data\n###### [Back to top](#table-of-content)\nYou can simply add custom data to the capture by adding a special field named **__SPECTOR_Metadata** to your WebGLObjects.\n\n```javascript\nvar cubeVerticesColorBuffer = gl.createBuffer();\ncubeVerticesColorBuffer.__SPECTOR_Metadata = { name: "cubeVerticesColorBuffer" };\n```\n\nThis will enable the visibility of your custom name in your capture. This can be an invaluable asset during troubleshoot session. This can also help with referencing your materials\' friendly names from your captures.\n\n## Learn About WebGL\n###### [Back to top](#table-of-content)\nI would advise you to check out and start with the Awesome [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/) the community there will be more than happy to welcome anybody willing to learn Web 3d.\n\n<p align="center">\n    <img src="https://spectordoc.babylonjs.com/pictures/babylonJS.png">\n</p>\n'
