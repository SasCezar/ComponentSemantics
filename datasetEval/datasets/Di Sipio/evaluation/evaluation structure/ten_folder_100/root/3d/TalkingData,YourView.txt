b"**YourView** is a desktop App in MacOS. You can use it to view iOS App's view hierarchy. I think it could be a `basic project` in app view visualization. Depend on it, you may do your add-on functions's development such as visual tracking like mixpanel, iOS reverse tool just like reveal, frida, even though, you can develop android studio plugin for view debugging. Now I treat it as a iOS reverse tool. Now it is a version of 0.1, I will maintain continuedly.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n- Open `YourView/iOS/TalkingDataSDKDemo/TalkingDataSDKDemo.xcodeproj`. It's a demo project with the libyourview source code as framework in it. Build and Run,keep the demo app in foreground.\n\n- Open `YourView/MacOS/YourView/YourView.xcodeproj`.Build and Run.\n\n  ![](./img/buildrun.png)\n\n- Input IP(only ip,without port and scheme) address ,click connect\n\n  ![](./img/connect.png)\n\n- Enjoy it!\n\n  ![](./img/usage.png)\n\n## Demo\n\nCamera control:\n\n![](./img/camera.gif)\n\n\n\nSearch and Live edit\n\n![](./img/shake.gif)\n\n## Tips\n\n- Now the `libyourview.framework` is build as a static libiary. If you want to get a dynamic libiary,you must change the mach-o type in the project settings and build it by yourself.\n- You don't need write any code. Once the framework is loaded,it will start a server automatily\n- The iOS UIView serilization operation will block the main thread.It maybe faster in Simulator than iOS devices.\n\n## TODO\n- Auto network scan using bonjour service like reveal.\n- Make the right panel powerful. Now it is hard coded.Make it dynamic,more functions in Object explore just like flex.\n- Add the the layout,gesture,viewController infomation to the left tree,just like reveal or Xcode.\n- User experience improvment.\n- Art works.\n- Script editor and inject support,such as JSPatch.\n- bug fix.\n\n## Explore others App\n\n- Build this project as a dynamic lib and inject the dynamic lib into others app by using MonkeyDev,IPAPatch,etc. Do it yourself.\n\n  ![](./img/wechat.jpg)\n\n\n## Thanks\n\n[swisspol/GCDWebServer](https://github.com/swisspol/GCDWebServer )  This project provide a good http service in iOS App.\n\n## Links\n- [TalkingData](https://github.com/TalkingData)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nGCDWebServer [license](https://github.com/swisspol/GCDWebServer/blob/master/LICENSE ) \n\nCopyright (c) 2015-present, TalkingData\n"
