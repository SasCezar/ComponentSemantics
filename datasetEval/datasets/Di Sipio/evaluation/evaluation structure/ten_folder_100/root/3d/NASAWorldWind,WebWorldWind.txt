The European Space Agency has provided valuable\ncontributions to this platform since 2015. Web WorldWind provides a geographic context, complete with terrain, and a\ncollection for shapes for displaying and interacting with geographic or geo-located information in 3D and 2D in any\nmodern web browser. High-resolution terrain and imagery is retrieved from remote servers automatically as needed, while\nenabling developers to include their own custom terrain and imagery.\n\n- [worldwind.arc.nasa.gov](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov) has setup instructions, developers guides, API documentation and more\n- [Forum](https://forum.worldwindcentral.com) provides help from the WorldWind community\n- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm) is used by the NASA WorldWind development team\n\n## Get Started\n\nThe Web WorldWind [Developer\'s Guide](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/web) has a complete description of Web WorldWind\'s\nfunctionality.
