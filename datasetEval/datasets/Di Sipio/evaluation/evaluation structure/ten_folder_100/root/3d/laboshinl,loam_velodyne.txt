b'# loam_velodyne\n\n![Screenshot](/capture.bmp)\nSample map built from [nsh_indoor_outdoor.bag](http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~jizhang03/Datasets/nsh_indoor_outdoor.bag) (opened with [ccViewer](http://www.danielgm.net/cc/))\n\n:white_check_mark: Tested with ROS Indigo and Velodyne VLP16. [(Screencast)](https://youtu.be/o1cLXY-Es54)\n\nAll sources were taken from [ROS documentation](http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/loam_velodyne/html/files.html)\n\nAsk questions [here](https://github.com/laboshinl/loam_velodyne/issues/3).\n\n## How to build with catkin\n\n```\n$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/\n$ git clone https://github.com/laboshinl/loam_velodyne.git\n$ cd ~/catkin_ws\n$ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \n$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash\n```\n\n## Running\n\n```\nroslaunch loam_velodyne loam_velodyne.launch\n```\n\nIn second terminal play sample velodyne data from [VLP16 rosbag](http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~jizhang03/Datasets/):\n```\nrosbag play ~/Downloads/velodyne.bag \n```\n\nOr read from velodyne [VLP16 sample pcap](https://midas3.kitware.com/midas/folder/12979):\n```\nroslaunch velodyne_pointcloud VLP16_points.launch pcap:="$HOME/Downloads/velodyne.pcap"\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### `multiScanRegistration` crashes right after playing bag file\n\nIssues [#71](https://github.com/laboshinl/loam_velodyne/issues/71) and\n[#7](https://github.com/laboshinl/loam_velodyne/issues/7) address this\nproblem. The current known solution is to build the same version of PCL that\nyou have on your system from source, and set the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`\naccordingly so that catkin can find it. See [this\nissue](https://github.com/laboshinl/loam_velodyne/issues/71#issuecomment-416024816)\nfor more details.\n\n\n---\n[Quantifying Aerial LiDAR Accuracy of LOAM for Civil Engineering Applications.](https://ceen.et.byu.edu/sites/default/files/snrprojects/wolfe_derek.pdf) Derek Anthony Wolfe\n\n[ROS & Loam_velodyne](https://ishiguro440.wordpress.com/2016/04/05/%E5%82%99%E5%BF%98%E9%8C%B2%E3%80%80ros-loam_velodyne/) \n'
