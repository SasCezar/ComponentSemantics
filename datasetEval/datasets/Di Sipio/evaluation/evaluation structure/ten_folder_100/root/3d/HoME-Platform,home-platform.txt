b'# HoME Platform [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HoME-Platform/home-platform.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HoME-Platform/home-platform)\n\nHoME is a platform for artificial agents to learn from vision, audio, semantics, physics, and interaction with objects and\nother agents, all within a realistic context.\n\nCheck out the paper on Arxiv for more details: [HoME: a Household Multimodal Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11017)\n\n![alt tag](https://github.com/HoME-Platform/home-platform/raw/master/doc/images/overview.png)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nMain requirements:\n- Python 2.7+ with Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib\n- (or Python 3.5+ but currently WIP, might have bugs)\n- [Panda3d](https://www.panda3d.org/) game engine for 3D rendering\n- [EVERT](https://github.com/sbrodeur/evert) engine for 3D acoustic ray-tracing\n- [PySoundFile](https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundFile) for Ogg Vorbis decoding\n\nTo install dependencies on Ubuntu operating systems:\n```\nsudo apt-get install python-pip python-tk python-dev build-essential libsndfile1 portaudio19-dev\nsudo pip2 install --upgrade pip numpy scipy matplotlib gym panda3d pysoundfile pyaudio resampy nose coverage Pillow imageio\n```\n\nor, for Python 3:\n```\nsudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-tk python3-dev build-essential libsndfile1 portaudio19-dev\nsudo pip3 install --upgrade pip numpy scipy matplotlib gym panda3d pysoundfile pyaudio resampy nose coverage Pillow imageio\n```\n\n(Packages `nose` and `coverage` are for tests only and can be omitted)\n\nFinally you have to install EVERT. In order to do so, please follow the instructions over at \nhttps://github.com/sbrodeur/evert\n\n## SUNCG Dataset\n\nThe Home environment is based on the [SUNCG](http://suncg.cs.princeton.edu/) dataset. \n\n**Important!** Before you can use this library, you need to obtain the SUNCG dataset.\nIn order to do so, please follow the instructions on their website.\n\nFor the test suit we included a single small house as sample in this repository.\n\n## Installing the library\n\nDownload the source code from the git repository:\n```\nmkdir -p $HOME/work\ncd $HOME/work\ngit clone https://github.com/HoME-Platform/home-platform.git\n```\n\nNote that the library must be in the PYTHONPATH environment variable for Python to be able to find it:\n```\nexport PYTHONPATH=$HOME/work/home-platform:$PYTHONPATH \n```\nThis can also be added at the end of the configuration file $HOME/.bashrc\n\n## Running unit tests\n\nTo ensure all libraries where correctly installed, it is advised to run the test suite:\n```\ncd $HOME/work/home-platform/tests\n./run_tests.sh\n```\nNote that this can take some time.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n**Before you start please read steps 0 and 1 so that you know what to expect. \nThe data installation and preparation can take some time (because it\'s a big dataset).**\n\n#### 0 Obtain and install the SUNCG dataset (only once)\n\nThe dataset can be acquired by contacting the authors at their website: http://suncg.cs.princeton.edu/\n\nCurrently the dataset downloaded consists of a single zip file, which in turn contains multiple zip files\n(one for each directory in [house, object, object_vox, room, texture]).\n\nPlease unzip all files so that as a result you have the folloging directory structure somewhere on your PC:\n```\n/some/path/doesnt/matter/SUNCG/\n/some/path/doesnt/matter/SUNCG/house/\n/some/path/doesnt/matter/SUNCG/house/0004d52d1aeeb8ae6de39d6bd993e992/\n/some/path/doesnt/matter/SUNCG/house/0004dd3cb11e50530676f77b55262d38/\n...\n/some/path/doesnt/matter/SUNCG/object/100/\n/some/path/doesnt/matter/SUNCG/object/101/\n...\n``` \n\nThe unzipped files take up approx 28.1GB disk space on an NTFS-formatted drive.\n\n**Warning** Unzipping may take considerable time and should not be done on a network drive\ndue to the overhead in network communication. We advise to extract everything on a local machine \nand if necessary copy it to networked machines via `rsync` like so:\n\n    rsync -avh --info=progress2 --remove-source-files /some/path/doesnt/matter/SUNCG /cluster/datasets/\n    \nOnce everything is unzipped, you can remove the original zip files.\n\nAs final step please "install" the dataset by (a) symlinking it into your home directory\n\n    ln -s /some/path/doesnt/matter/SUNCG/ ~/.suncg \n\n**or** by (b) setting the environmental variable to the right path:\n\n    export SUNCG_DATA_DIR="/cluster/datasets/SUNCG"\n    \nIf you do both of these things, the environmental variable takes precedent.\n\n#### 1 Convert the houses into a usable format (only once)\n\nIn order for Panda3D to be able to read the 3D files of the houses, you need\nto first convert them to a different format (from OBJ/Wavefront to EGG and BAM).\n\nTo do so, just cd into the scripts folder in this repository and run the conversion script:\n\n    # assuming you currently are in the directory of this readme file:\n    cd scripts\n    \n    # if you installed the dataset via symlink:\n    ./convert_suncg.sh ~/.suncg/ # the trailing slash is important\n    \n    # if you installed the dataset via environmental vairable:\n    ./convert_suncg.sh $SUNCG_DATA_DIR/ # the trailing slash might be important\n    \n'
