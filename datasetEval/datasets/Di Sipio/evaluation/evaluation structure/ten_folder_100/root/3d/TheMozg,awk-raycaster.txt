b'# awkaster\nBring some old-school fun to your terminal! Explore the dungeon and shoot monsters in this pseudo-3D game inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D and Doom.\n\n![Screenshot](screenshot.png)\n\n# Running the game\n`gawk -f awkaster.awk`\n\nYou need `gawk` version >= `4.0.0`\n\n\nOS X users must install `gawk` first. The easiest way to do this is to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Once it has been installed, run the following commands:\n```\nbrew update\nbrew install gawk\n```\n\nNetBSD users require `gawk`. The easiest way to do it is install it with [pkgin](http://pkgin.net):\n```\npkgin install gawk\n```\n\nAlternatively install from sources using the [pkgsrc framework](https://pkgsrc.org/):\n```\ncd /usr/pkgsrc/lang/gawk && make install\n```\n\n\nOpenBSD users require `gawk`. The easiest way to do it is install it with [pkg_add](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/pkg_add.1):\n```\npkg_add gawk\n```\n\nAlternatively install from sources using the [OpenBSD ports](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/ports.7):\n```\ncd /usr/ports/lang/gawk && make install clean\n```\nYour machine will now be ready to run *awkaster*.\n\n# How to play\nYour objective is to navigate the map and activate exit elevator, killing hoards of monsters in the process.\n\nControls:\n* WASD - movement\n* J/L - turn left/right. Hold shift to turn quicker\n* spacebar - shoot\n* num 1-4 - change color mode\n* x - activate elevator (arrives after 1000 moves)\n\n# Adjusting resolution\nBy default game resolution is 64x48 "pixels", which are just a pair of ASCII symbols. That means your terminal needs to be at least 128 chars wide. You may change variables `w` and `h` to your liking.\n\n# Game engine\nWall rendering is done using ray casting. Monsters and projectiles are added after that as sprites.\nRay casting is a simple rendering algorithm that doesn\'t require any 3d modeling or complex computation.\n\nYou can find an excellent tutorial here:\nhttp://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html\n'
