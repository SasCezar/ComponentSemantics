b"# Understandable RayTracing in 256 lines of bare C++\n\nThis repository is a support code for my computer graphics lectures. It is not meant to be the ultimate rendering code or even physically realistic. It is meant to be **simple**. This project is distributed under the [DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL).\n\n**Check [the wiki](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki) that accompanies the source code. The second raytracing chapter is available [in the tinykaboom repository](https://github.com/ssloy/tinykaboom/wiki). If you are looking for a software rasterizer, check the [other part of the lectures](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki).**\n\nIn my lectures I tend to avoid third party libraries as long as it is reasonable, because it forces to understand what is happening under the hood. So, the raytracing 256 lines of plain C++ give us this result:\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/master/out.jpg)\n\n## compilation\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer.git\ncd tinyraytracer\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake\n```\n\nYou can open the project in Gitpod, a free online dev evironment for GitHub:\n\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer)\n\nOn open, the editor will compile & run the program as well as open the resulting image in the editor's preview.\nJust change the code in the editor and rerun the script (use the terminal's history) to see updated images.\n"
