When *preserve log* is *off*, we use this API to know when to clear the requests list.\n\n##### Permission to "Read and modify all your data on all websites you visit"\n\nClockwork uses the `webRequest` API, used for observing HTTP requests made by the browser, including submitted data, URLs, full response content, with ability to block or modify these requests.\n\nUsed for observing incoming HTTP requests for Clockwork-enabled applications and loading Clockwork metadata from headers.\n\nWe immediately disregard any requests to non Clockwork-enabled applications, we never modify or store requests.\n\nThe extension available in the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Addons is always the latest tagged commit in this repository with no modifications.\n\n### Licence\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Miroslav Rigler\n\nMIT License\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n"Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
