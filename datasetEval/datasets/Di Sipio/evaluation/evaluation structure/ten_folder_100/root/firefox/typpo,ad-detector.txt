b'# AdDetector\n\nAdDetector is a Chrome and Firefox addon that flags articles with corporate sponsors by putting a banner above articles which may mislead the reader.\n\n"Corporate content" is present in publications like the New York Times, Newsweek, The Atlantic, Buzzfeed, and others. Stories are sometimes marked as sponsored, but these indicators are sometimes very subtle, leaving many users unaware that the article is sponsored.\n\nAdDetector contains rules to identify small "sponsored" markings. In some cases, these indicators are not even visible normally and instead are hidden in the source code of the webpage.\n\n## Install for Chrome or Firefox\n\nGet the latest download links on the [AdDetector site](http://ianww.com/ad-detector).\n\n## Running from source\n\nStart by running `./setup_hardlinks`.\n\nThe hardlinks connect generic code in `src/` to the proper locations in browser-specific subdirectories (browsers won\'t follow symlinks).  To make changes to injected code, you only need to edit files under `src/`.\n\nNext, run the extension locally in your browser of choice.  For Chrome, go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, and load the `chrome/` directory.  For Firefox, set up your [sdk](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation) and run `cfx run` in the `firefox/` directory.\n\n## Testing\n\nThe tests rely on `casperjs` and `phantomjs`.  You should `npm install -g` these before running `test/testHarness.js`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nI value contributions.  Looking for an easy way to get involved?  Add a [rule](https://github.com/typpo/ad-detector/blob/master/src/rules.js) for a site currently not covered by AdDetector, or check out the issues page.
