b'# SingleFile\r\nSingleFile is a Web Extension compatible with Chrome, Firefox (Desktop and Mobile), Chromium-based Edge, Vivaldi, Brave, Waterfox, Yandex browser, and Opera. It helps you to save a complete web page into a single HTML file.\r\n\r\n## Table of Contents\r\n - [Demo](#demo)\r\n - [Install](#install)\r\n - [Getting started](#getting-started)\r\n - [Additional notes](#additional-notes)\r\n - [FAQ](#faq)\r\n - [Release notes](#release-notes)\r\n - [Known issues](#known-issues)\r\n - [Troubleshooting unknown issues](#troubleshooting-unknown-issues)\r\n - [Command Line Interface](#command-line-interface)\r\n - [Integration with user scripts](#integration-with-user-scripts)\r\n - [SingleFileZ](#singlefilez)\r\n - [File format comparison](#file-format-comparison)\r\n - [Statistics (Firefox)](#statistics-firefox)\r\n - [Integration with WebKit](#integration-with-webkit)\r\n - [Privacy policy](#privacy-policy)\r\n - [Contributors](#contributors)\r\n - [Icons](#icons)\r\n - [Code derived from third party projects](#code-derived-from-third-party-projects)\r\n - [License](#license)\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n![](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile-Demos/blob/master/SingleFile-demo.gif)\r\n\r\n## Install\r\nSingleFile can be installed:\r\n - Firefox: Unzip this file https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/files/3877433/singlefile_save_a_page_as_a_single_html_file-1.13.23-an%2Bfx.xpi.zip and open the xpi file in a tab. This is the last signed version of the extension.\r\n - Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle,\r\n - You can aslo download the zip file (https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/archive/master.zip) of the project and install it manually.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n- Wait until the page is fully loaded.\r\n- Click on the SingleFile button in the extension toolbar to save the page.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes\r\n - To save multiple tabs, select them first and click on the SingleFile button.\r\n - Open the context menu by right-clicking the SingleFile button in the extension toolbar or on the webpage. It allows you to save:\r\n   - the current tab,\r\n   - or the selected content,\r\n   - or the selected frame.\r\n - You can also process multiple tabs in one click and save:\r\n   - the selected tabs,\r\n   - or the unpinned tabs,\r\n   - or all the tabs.\r\n - You can annotate the page before saving it by selecting "Annotate and save the page..." in the context menu.\r\n - The context menu also allows you to activate the auto-save of:\r\n   - the current tab,\r\n   - or the unpinned tabs,\r\n   - or all the tabs.\r\n - You can interrupt the saving progress by clicking on the SingleFile button when processing a page.\r\n - With auto-save active, pages are automatically saved every time after being loaded (or before being unloaded if not).\r\n - Right-click on the SingleFile button and select "Options"/"Manage extension" to open the options page.\r\n - The default save folder is the download folder configured in your browser, cf. about:preferences in Firefox and chrome://settings in Chrome.\r\n - You can use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Y to save the current tab or the selected tabs. Go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts to change it in Chrome.\r\n - See the extension help in the options page for more detailed information about the options and technical notes.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\nSee https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/blob/master/faq.md\r\n\r\n## Release notes\r\nSee https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/single-file/versions/\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- All browsers:\r\n  - For security reasons, you cannot save pages hosted on https://chrome.google.com, https://addons.mozilla.org and some other Mozilla domains. When this happens, \xf0\x9f\x9b\x87 is displayed on top of the SingleFile icon.\r\n  - For [security reasons](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image), SingleFile is sometimes unable to save the image representation of [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) and snapshots of [video](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) elements.\r\n  - The last saved path cannot be remembered by default. To circumvent this limitation, disable the option "Misc > save pages in background".\r\n  - The following characters are replaced with `_` in file names: `~`, `+`, `\\`, `?`, `%`, `*`, `:`, `"`, `<`, `>`  \r\n- Chrome:\r\n  - You must enable the option "Allow access to file URLs" in the extension page to display the infobar when viewing a saved page, or to save a page stored on the filesystem.\r\n  - If the file name of a saved page looks like "56833935-156b-4d8c-a00f-19599c6513d3.html", disable the option "Misc > save pages in background". Reinstalling the browser may also fix this issue.\r\n  - Disabling the option "File name > open the "Save as" dialog to confirm the file name" will work if and only if the option "Ask where to save each file before downloading" is disabled in chrome://settings/downloads.\r\n- Firefox:\r\n  - The "File name > file name conflict resolution" option does not work if set to "prompt for a name"\r\n- Waterfox\r\n  - When opening pages saved with the option "Images > group duplicate images together" enabled, some duplicate images might not displayed. It is recommended to disable this option.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting unknown issues\r\nPlease follow these steps if you find an unknown issue:\r\n- Save the page in incognito.\r\n- If saving page in incognito did not fix the issue, reset SingleFile options.\r\n- If resetting options did not fix the issue, restart the browser.\r\n- If restarting the browser did not fix the issue, try to disable all other extensions to see if there is a conflict.\r\n- If there is a conflict then try to determine against which extension(s).\r\n- Please report the issue with a short description on how to reproduce it here: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/issues.\r\n\r\n## Command Line Interface\r\nYou can save web pages to HTML from the command line interface. See here for more info: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/blob/master/cli/README.MD.\r\n  \r\n## Integration with user scripts\r\nYou can execute a user script just before (and after) SingleFile saves a page. For more info, see https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/wiki/How-to-execute-a-user-script-before-a-page-is-saved\r\n\r\n\r\n## SingleFileZ\r\nSingleFileZ is a fork of SingleFile that allows you to save a webpage as a self-extracting HTML file. This HTML file is also a valid ZIP file which contains the resources (images, fonts, stylesheets and frames) of the saved page. This ZIP file can be unzipped on the filesystem in order, for example, to view the page in a browser that would not support pages saved with SingleFileZ.\r\n\r\nMore info here:
