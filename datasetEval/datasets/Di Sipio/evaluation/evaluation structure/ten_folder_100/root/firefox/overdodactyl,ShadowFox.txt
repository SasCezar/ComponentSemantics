b'![header](.github/Screenshots/header.png)\n\nShadowFox was inspired by changes made in Firefox 57, which limited the amount addons could customize both the user interface and "protected" web pages.\n\nThis project aims at creating a universal dark theme for Firefox while adhering to the modern design principles set by Mozilla.\n\nYou can visit the ShadowFox website at [overdodactyl.github.io/ShadowFox/](https://overdodactyl.github.io/ShadowFox/).\n\n## Preview\n\n![preferences](.github/Screenshots/preview.png)\n\nShadowFox styles the entire user interface, protected webpages (such as `about:` pages and addons.mozilla.org), and over 40 popular addons.\n\n## Installation and Updating\n\nA cross-platform installer/uninstaller/updater is maintained in the [shadowfox-updater](https://github.com/SrKomodo/shadowfox-updater) repository.  Latest versions can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/SrKomodo/shadowfox-updater/releases) section, or via `Homebrew`, `MacPorts`, and `AUR`.  Please see the [README](https://github.com/SrKomodo/shadowfox-updater/blob/master/README.md) file for details on how to use the updater (GUI and CLI options available) and solutions to common problems.\n\n## Customization\n\nIt\'s easy to customize ShadowFox.  You can choose what colors are used, what elements and webpages are styled, or add your own css tweaks.  For more information, see [here](https://github.com/overdodactyl/ShadowFox/wiki/Customization).  \n\nDepending on how much you want to customize ShadowFox, you may be better suited using a different installation process.
