b'### Firefox Decrypt\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unode/firefox_decrypt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/unode/firefox_decrypt) [![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/d9b714c5d195dd9e7582e8cd6f463982/m/master "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/byKey/d9b714c5d195dd9e7582e8cd6f463982)\n\n**Currently the master branch is unstable while we migrate to Python 3.**  \n\nIf you must use Python 2, please try [version 0.7.0](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/releases/tag/0.7.0).  \n\nIf you have problems using it give the latest [release](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/releases) a try or check open issues for ongoing work.\n\n#### About\n\nFirefox Decrypt is a tool to extract passwords from Firefox/Thunderbird\nprofiles.\n\nIt can be used to recover passwords from a profile protected by a Master\nPassword as long as the latter is known.\nIf a profile is not protected by a Master Password, a password will still be\nrequested but can be left blank.\n\nThis tool does not try to crack or brute-force the Master Password in any way.\nIf the Master Password is not known it will simply fail to recover any data.\n\nThis script is written in Python and is compatible with versions ~~2.7+~~ (last is [0.7.0](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/releases/tag/0.7.0)) and 3.6+. On Windows, only Python 3 is supported.\n\nAdditionally, it requires access to libnss3 which is part of Firefox and\nThunderbird, although depending on system configuration, the script may fail to\nlocate it there or load an incorrect/incompatible version.\n\nAlternatively, you can install libnss3 (Debian/Ubuntu) or nss (Arch/Gentoo/...).\nlibnss3 is part of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS\n\nIf you need to decode passwords from Firefox 3 or older,\nthis is not officially supported but a patch exists in [this pull request](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/pull/36).\n\n#### Usage\n\nSimply run:\n\n```\npython firefox_decrypt.py\n```\n\nand it will prompt for which profile to use and the master password of that\nprofile.\n\nIf you don\'t keep your Firefox profiles on a standard folder you can call the\nscript with:\n\n```\npython firefox_decrypt.py /folder/containing/profiles.ini/\n```\n\nIf you don\'t want to display all passwords on the screen you can use:\n\n```\npython firefox_decrypt.py | grep -C2 keyword\n```\nwhere keyword is part of the expected output (URL, username, email, password ...)\n\nSince version **0.7.0** passwords may be exported in CSV format using the `--format` flag.\n\n```\npython firefox_decrypt.py --format csv\n```\n\nAdditionally, `--delimiter` and `--quotechar` flags can specify which characters to use as delimiters and quote characters in the CSV output.\n\nSince version **0.4** it is now also possible to export stored passwords to\n*pass* from http://passwordstore.org . To do so use:\n\n```\npython firefox_decrypt.py --export-pass\n```\nand **all** existing passwords will be exported after the pattern\n`web/<address>[:<port>]` unless multiple credentials exist for the same website\nin which case `/<login>` is appended.\nThe username will be stored on a second line.\n\nAlternatively you can use:\n```\npython firefox_decrypt.py --export-pass --pass-compat browserpass\n```\nto prefix the username with `login: ` for compatibility with the [browserpass](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/browserpass) extension.\n\nThere is currently no way of selectively exporting passwords.\nExporting overwrites existing passwords without warning. Make sure you have a\nbackup or are using the `pass git` functionality.\n\nStarting with version **0.5.2** it is now possible to use a non-interactive mode which bypasses all prompts, including profile choice and master password.\nUse it with `-n/--no-interactive`. Indicate your profile choice by passing `-c/--choice N` where N is the number of the profile you wish to decrypt (starting from **1**).\nYou can list all available profiles with `-l/--list` (to stdout).\nYour master password is read from stdin.\n\n    $ python firefox_decrypt.py --list\n    1 -> l1u1xh65.default\n    2 -> vuhdnx5b.YouTube\n    3 -> 1d8vcool.newdefault\n    4 -> ekof2ces.SEdu\n    5 -> 8a52xmtt.Fresh\n\n    $ read -sp "Master Password: " PASSWORD\n    Master Password:\n\n    $ echo $PASSWORD | python firefox_decrypt.py --no-interactive --choice 4\n    Website:   https://login.example.com\n    Username: \'john.doe\'\n    Password: \'1n53cur3\'\n\n    Website:   https://example.org\n    Username: \'max.mustermann\'\n    Password: \'Passwort1234\'\n\n    Website:   https://github.com\n    Username: \'octocat\'\n    Password: \'qJZo6FduRcHw\'\n\n    [...snip...]\n\n    $ echo $PASSWORD | python firefox_decrypt.py -nc 1\n    Website:   https://git-scm.com\n    Username: \'foo\'\n    Password: \'bar\'\n\n    Website:   https://gitlab.com\n    Username: \'whatdoesthefoxsay\'\n    Password: \'w00fw00f\'\n\n    [...snip...]\n\n    $ # Unset Password\n    $ PASSWORD=\n\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you run into problems please try running `firefox_decrypt` in high verbosity mode by calling it with:\n\n```\npython firefox_decrypt.py -vvv\n```\n\nIf the output doesn\'t help you identify the cause and a solution to the problem please file a bug report including the verbose output.  \n**NOTE**: Be aware that your profile password, as well as other passwords, may be visible in the output so make sure you remove any sensitive data before including it in the bug report.\n\n##### Windows\n\nIf you are on Windows, make sure your Python and Firefox are both 32 or 64 bits.  \nIf you mix architectures the code will fail. More information on issue [#8](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/issues/8).\n\n##### Darwin/MacOS\n\nIf you get the error described in [#14](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/issues/14) when loading `libnss3` consider installing `nss` using brew or other package managers.\n\n#### Testing\n\nIf you wish to run the test suite locally chdir into `tests/` and run `./run_all`\n\nIf any test fails on your system please ensure `libnss` is installed.\n\nIf afterwards tests still fail, re-run with `./run_all -v` and file a bug\nreport including this output. Please include some information about your\nsystem, including Linux distribution, and version of libnss/firefox.\n\nIt is much appreciated.\n\n#### Spin-off, derived and related works\n\n* [firepwned](https://github.com/christophetd/firepwned#how-it-works) - check if your passwords have been involved in a known data leak\n* [FF Password Exporter](https://github.com/kspearrin/ff-password-exporter) - Firefox AddOn for exporting passwords\n'
