(Who wants to be square, right?)\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x98\x8d How do I get this sexy thing? \xf0\x9f\x98\x8d\nSince Firefox 57+, the only way to customize your browser UI is through `userChrome.css`. Learn more [here](http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.php?title=UserChrome.css&printable=yes).\n\nRough instructions:\n1. Go to your Firefox browser, type `about:config` in your url bar.\n1. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`\n1. Type `about:profiles` in your url bar.\n1. Under the profile that is in use (The message is something like `This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted.`), click `Open Folder` on the `Root Directory` row.\n1. If that folder does not have a `chrome` folder, create a folder, name it `chrome`.\n1. In the `chrome` folder, create a file named `userChrome.css`\n1. Determine what Firefox theme you are using:\n    1. Click the icon with 3 lines on the top right corner to open the context Menu.\n    1. Select `Customize`.\n    1. At the bottom left of your screen, select `Themes`.\n    1. Choose or determine which theme you want to use, they can either be `Dark`, `Default`, or `Light`.\n1. Copy and paste the code that matches your Firefox theme: [Dark](./userChrome-dark.css), [Default](./userChrome-default.css), [Light](./userChrome-light.css) into your `userChrome.css` file that you have created.\n<br/>**WARNING:** Newer versions of Firefox with Mojave or Windows 10 Dark Mode will cause Firefox to use the `Dark` theme by default. In this case, you should use the [userChrome-dark.css](./userChrome-dark.css) theme.\n1. Restart Firefox and enjoy some sexy curves :D\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x98\x9e Something is broken \xf0\x9f\x98\x9e\nFret not!
