b'[![PyPI\nversion](https://badge.fury.io/py/ffpass.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ffpass)\n[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/ffpass)](https://pepy.tech/project/ffpass)\n\n# ffpass - Import and Export passwords for Firefox Quantum\n\nThe latest version of Firefox doesn\'t allow to import or export the\nstored logins and passwords as a file.\n\nThis tools interacts with the encrypted password database of Firefox to\nprovide these features.\n\n## Installation\n\nffpass requires Python 3.6+ and will work with Firefox 58+\n\n``` bash\npip install ffpass\n```\n\n## Features\n\n  - Supports master passwords\n  - Automatic profile selection for Linux, macOS and Windows\n  - Export to CSV\n  - Import from CSV compatible with Google Chrome\n\n> Note: Firefox must be closed during the whole process, as these\n> actions change its database. \n>\n> Note: If you have Sync enabled, you\'ll have to disconnect and\n> reconnect your Firefox account after importing the passwords.\n\n## Export to CSV\n\n``` bash\nffpass export > passwords.csv\nffpass export -t passwords.csv\nffpass export --to passwords.csv\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n    usage: ffpass export [-h] [-t TO_FILE] [-d DIRECTORY] [-v]\n    \n    outputs a CSV with header `url,username,password`\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      -t TO_FILE, --to TO_FILE\n      -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY, --dir DIRECTORY\n                            Firefox profile directory\n      -v, --verbose\n\n## Import from CSV\n\n``` bash\nffpass import < passwords.csv\nffpass import -f passwords.csv\nffpass import --from passwords.csv\n```\n\nBy default, it works with the passwords exported from Google Chrome.\n\n### Usage\n\n    usage: ffpass import [-h] [-f FROM_FILE] [-d DIRECTORY] [-v]\n    \n    imports a CSV with columns `url,username,password` (order insensitive)\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      -f FROM_FILE, --from FROM_FILE\n      -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY, --dir DIRECTORY\n                            Firefox profile directory\n      -v, --verbose\n\n## Transfer from Google Chrome to Firefox\n\nNow, Firefox can more accurately import logins saved in Chrome/Chromium on Windows and macOS (including timestamps, deduping, http auth. logins, etc.) so you don\'t need to use this tool on those operating systems. See File > Import from Another Browser\xe2\x80\xa6 in Firefox to import.\n\n### Export from Google Chrome\n\n1.

To find it, follow these\n    [instructions](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data#w_how-do-i-find-my-profile)\n    on the website of Firefox.\n\n  - `Firefox password database is empty. Please create it from Firefox.`\n    \n    It means that Firefox currently doens\'t store any password. `ffpass`\n    cannot create the password database for security reasons. Just add\n    one password manually to Firefox to create the database.\n\n  - `TypeError: \'PosixPath\' object is not iterable`\n    \n    See [\\#17](https://github.com/louisabraham/ffpass/issues/17).\n\n  - Empty url field in Firefox after importing: the urls of the source\n    csv file must begin with a scheme (`http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`,\n    etc\xe2\x80\xa6)\n    \n  - Passwords do not sync to other devices, including Lockwise app.\n\n    Importing passwords break the sync. You\'ll have to disconnect the\n    Firefox account in the Sync options and the re-add it.\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks a lot to @lclevy for the retro-engineering\\!
