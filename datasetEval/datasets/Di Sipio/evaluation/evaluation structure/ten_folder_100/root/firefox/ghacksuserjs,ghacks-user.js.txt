b"### ![][b] user.js\nA `user.js` is a configuration file that can control hundreds of Firefox settings. For a more technical breakdown and explanation, you can read more on the [overview](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/1.1-Overview) wiki page.\n\n### ![][b] ghacks user.js\nThe `ghacks user.js` is a **template** which aims to provide as much privacy and enhanced security as possible, and to reduce tracking and fingerprinting as much as possible - while minimizing any loss of functionality and breakage (but it will happen).\n\nEveryone, experts included, should at least read the [implementation](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/1.3-Implementation) wiki page, as it contains important information regarding a few `ghacks user.js` settings.\n\nNote that we do *not* recommend connecting over Tor on Firefox. Use the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) if your [threat model](https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en) calls for it, or for accessing hidden services. \n\nAlso be aware that this `user.js` is made specifically for desktop Firefox. Using it as-is in other Gecko-based browsers can be counterproductive, especially in the Tor Browser.\n\nSitemap: [Releases](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/releases), [changelogs](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Achangelog), [Wiki](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki), [stickies](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22sticky+topic%22).
