b'# Deprecated\n\nMin Vid has [graduated from Test Pilot](https://medium.com/firefox-test-pilot/min-vid-graduation-report-9ad74dc37c1). Keep an eye on [WICG/picture-in-picture](https://github.com/WICG/picture-in-picture) for a possible future in Firefox.\n\n------\n\n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/min-vid">\n    <img width="192" src="docs/images/gradient-logo.png">\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meandavejustice/min-vid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meandavejustice/min-vid) [![Available on Test Pilot](https://img.shields.io/badge/available_on-Test_Pilot-0996F8.svg)](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/min-vid)\n\nMin Vid is a Firefox web extension that gives you **complete control**\nover the videos in your browser. You can pop out, sticky, resize, and\ndrag videos anywhere within the browser - it even stays visible when\nyou switch tabs, so you can keep watching while you browse.\n\nThis is an experiment - seeing what happens when users have\ntotal control over the media they\'re consuming on the web. Users should be\nable to consume content in whatever way they feel comfortable. In the\nfuture we may be exploring these concepts with other forms of media,\nsuch as audio or pdfs.\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce the extension is installed you are able to launch Min Vid from the\noverlay icon over videos on YouTube and Vimeo.\n\nYou can also launch Min Vid by right clicking on a video link and\nsending to the player from the context menu.\n\n<img src="docs/images/launching.gif" width="49%"/>\n<img src="docs/images/dragging.gif" width="49%"/>\n\n## Installation\n\n* `npm install`\n* `npm run package` (creates `addon.xpi` in the min-vid directory)\n* Open Firefox, go to `about:config`, set some prefs:\n  * set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false` (allows unsigned extensions to be installed)\n  * set `extensions.legacy.enabled` to `true` (allows legacy extensions, like min-vid)\n* install xpi by dragging onto the `about:addons` page\n\n**note**\nThe `xpinstall.signatures.required` option in `about:config` needs to\nbe set in order to install unsigned extensions.\n\n## Development\nContributions welcome. To get started,\n\n1.  Clone the repo: `https://github.com/meandavejustice/min-vid.git`\n\n2.  Install packages:  `npm install`\n\n3. `npm run dev` to watch for file changes while developing. (jpm watchpost has been disabled for this\nrelease, we are working on a way to add it back, in the meantime, you will need to manually dragndrop\nthe xpi onto the `about:addons` page)\n\nFor further information on contributing, see [contributing.md](./contributing.md)\n\n## Notes\n\n[chrome/content/img/loading-bars.svg](chrome/content/img/loading-bars.svg) is from https://github.com/jxnblk/loading\n\n## Localization\n\nMin Vid localization is managed via [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/test-pilot-min-vid/), not direct pull requests to the repository.
