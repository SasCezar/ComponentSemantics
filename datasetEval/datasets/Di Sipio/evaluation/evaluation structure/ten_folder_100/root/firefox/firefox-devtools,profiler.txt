b'# Firefox Profiler\n\n[![slack-badge]][slack]\n\nThe [Firefox Profiler] visualizes performance data recorded from web browsers. It is a tool designed to consume performance profiles from the Gecko Profiler but can visualize data from any profiler able to output in JSON. The interface is a web application built using [React] and [Redux] and runs entirely client-side.\n\n[Mozilla] develops this tool to help make [Firefox] silky smooth and fast for millions of its users, and to help make sites and apps faster across the web.\n\n![Screenshot of the Firefox Profiler](./docs-user/images/screenshot-2019-02-05.jpg?raw=true)\n\n_This project was previously called perf.html and [Cleopatra]._\n\n### Usage\n\n> Visit [profiler.firefox.com](https://profiler.firefox.com/) :rocket:\n\nThis project is live on [https://profiler.firefox.com/](https://profiler.firefox.com/). The website includes instructions on how to get going to start recording and viewing performance profiles.\n\n### Accessibility: Assistive technology support\n\nThe Profiler was tested with recent versions of the following assistive technology:\n\n[NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) (Windows) on Firefox and Chrome browsers </br>\n[VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/) (Mac OS X) on Chrome</br>\n[Orca](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Orca?action=show&redirect=Orca) (Linux) on Firefox\n\nIf you experience problems using any of the above technologies, please file a bug.\n\nIf you would like to help us test on other assistive technologies or improve the existing code, we would love your contributions!\n\n### Development\n\nYou will need a recent enough version of [Yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/),\nversion 1.10 is known to work correctly.\nYou can install it into your home directory on Linux and probably OS X with:\n\n```bash\ncd /tmp\nwget https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh\nchmod a+x install.sh\n./install.sh\n```\n\nTo download and build the Firefox Profiler web app run:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:firefox-devtools/profiler.git\ncd profiler\nyarn install\nyarn start\n```\n\nYou can also develop the Firefox Profiler online in a pre-configured development environment:\n\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/firefox-devtools/profiler)\n\nFor more detailed information on getting started contributing. We have plenty of docs available to get you started.\n\n| | |\n| ---- | --- |\n|[Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)| Find out in detail how to get started and get your local development environment configured. |\n|[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)| We want to create an open and inclusive community, we have a few guidelines to help us out. |\n|[Developer Documentation](./docs-developer)| Want to know how this whole thing works? Get started here. |\n|[Source Files](./src)| Dive into the inner workings of the code. Most folders have a `README.md` providing more information. |\n|[Gecko Profiler Addon][Gecko Profiler]| The Firefox Profiler can record profiles directly in the browser using an add-on, development takes place in another repo. |\n\n### Discussion\n\nSay hello on [slack] in the #perf channel.\n\n### License\n\n[MPL v2](./LICENSE)\n\nSome permissive software licenses request but do not require an acknowledgement of the use of their software.
