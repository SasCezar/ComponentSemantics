b'# MaterialFox\n*A Material Design-inspired userChrome.css theme for Firefox*\n\n![Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5405629/45172944-21d91900-b24a-11e8-8bc5-03814121b0de.png)\nThis theme is powered by blood, sweat, and coffee. If you like it, please consider helping out to support its continued development.\n\n[![Buy me a coffee](https://svgshare.com/i/8Yd.svg)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/n4ho5QX2l)\n\n## What this does\nInspired by Google\'s Material Design and their latest Google Chrome UI, this theme turns your Firefox into a Material-styled web browser. The aim was to style the browser as closely as possible to the latest Google Chrome dev builds, where practical.\n\nThis is a userChrome.css theme, which means you must manually add it to your Firefox profile. The theme overrides certain browser styles. Currently, only the main UI is affected (settings pages, etc. are not). More elements of the UI may be styled in the future.\n\n## Installation\nSome steps involve accessing the about:config page. You can get there by typing it into your urlbar.\n\n### Mandatory instructions\n1. Copy the chrome folder into your Firefox profile directory. To find your profile directory, go to about:support. Alternatively, you can symlink your chrome folder instead of copying.\n2. [about:config] Set ```toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets``` to ```true``` (default is ```false```).\n3. [about:config] Set ```svg.context-properties.content.enabled``` to ```true``` (default is ```false```).\n4. Restart Firefox.\n\n### Recommended instructions\nAdd space above tab bar:\n* Right click on toolbar -> Customize.\n* Check Drag Space checkbox.\n\nReplicate Chrome behaviour for clipped tabs:\n* [about:config] Set ```browser.tabs.tabClipWidth``` to ```83``` (default is ```144```).\n\nAllow tabs to shrink more; tabs in overflow will look the same as pinned tabs:\n* [about:config] Add new entry ```materialFox.reduceTabOverflow``` with value ```true```.\n\nReplicate Chrome\'s "Not Secure" text on HTTP:\n* [about:config] Set ```security.insecure_connection_text.enabled``` to ```true```.\n\n## Please note\n* Linux is not frequently tested; last tested on 21/05/2019.\n* Some customisation settings may no longer work (such as compact/touch density).\n* Some custom themes may clash with address bar.\n'
