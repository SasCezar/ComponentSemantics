Hit enter, or click one of the results in the right panel. This is faster than opening your browser (if it isn\'t already), opening a new tab, and clicking the search bar.\n\nAfter a simple setup, you can use *any* browser (provided it is registered as a protocol handler) and *any* search engine. If you are having trouble getting either of these to work, send me an email at support@spikespaz.com or create an [issue](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/issues), and I will see what I can do to get your custom settings working.\n\n[**Don\'t forget to check the wiki if you have any questions!**](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/wiki)\n\n**Also, please star this repository if you like what I\'ve made!**\n\n---\n\n**Note:** There is a free version and a paid version. Both are exactly the same. The free version is unsigned and may register a false-positive with your antivirus software. The version on the Microsoft Store costs $1.99, and is digitally signed and distributed by Microsoft. The free (classic) version uses custom code for automatic updates (source is [here](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/blob/master/source/updater.d)). I would greatly appreciate if you tried the free version from GitHub and later paid for the Store version, as even the few dollars goes a long way to help me out.\n\n<h1>\n  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P8ZJJ80RZ2K">\n    <img src="assets/store.png" alt="Get it from Microsoft!" width="200"\\>\n  </a>\n</h1>\n\n**If you find this software useful and would like to show your appreciation, please consider making a small donation!**\n\n<h1>\n  <a href="https://spikespaz.com/donate">\n    <img src="https://spikespaz.com/images/donate/donate.svg" alt="Donate!" width="200"\\>\n  </a>\n</h1>\n\n# Doesn\'t this already exist?\n\nYes, there are two other similar projects. [EdgeDeflector](https://github.com/da2x/EdgeDeflector) and [SearchWithMyBrowser](https://github.com/sylveon/SearchWithMyBrowser).\n\nAfter using EdgeDeflector for quite some time, I noticed several issues with it. Sometimes it didn\'t work properly, it wasn\'t very configurable, and it relied on a browser extension (Chrometana) to change the search engine from Bing. I also tried SearchWithMyBrowser, however it had the same problems. I did not like the reliance on other software, so I set out to create a complete solution.\n\n# How do I set it up?\n\nGet it at the Microsoft Store [here](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P8ZJJ80RZ2K) to support development or download the latest installer executable by clicking [here](https://spikespaz.com/tools/repo-dl/?user=spikespaz&repo=search-deflector&file=SearchDeflector-Installer.exe). Just follow the prompts.\n\n**Take a look at the [Wiki page](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/wiki/Setup-&-Installing) if you\'re having trouble or need more information.**\n\n# I found a bug / it doesn\'t work!\n\n**First, look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/wiki/Troubleshooting) for help.** If that still doesn\'t fix your problem, submit a new [issue](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/issues) describing the problem with as much detail as possible.\n\n# Links\n\n| Name | Link |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| Homepage | https://spikespaz.com/search-deflector                                    |\n| Download | http://tiny.cc/get-search-deflector                                       |\n| Store    | https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P8ZJJ80RZ2K                    |\n| Wiki     | https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/wiki                        |\n| Issues   | https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/issues                      |\n| License  | https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector/blob/master/LICENSE         |\n| Email    | support@spikespaz.com                                                     |\n\n# Special thanks\n\nThank you to [@da2x](https://github.com/da2x) and [@sylveon](https://github.com/sylveon) for the inspiration, their source code helped greatly as a reference during development of Search Deflector, and [@adamdruppe](https://github.com/adamdruppe) for one-on-one help over IRC and his library, `minigui`, which makes this program\'s GUI possible.\n\nAdditionally, thanks to all of following early-adopters who reported the first issues and helped in the early days:\n\n[@elliottedward327](https://github.com/elliottedward327),\n[@maxloh](https://github.com/maxloh),\n[@Thomas-QM](https://github.com/Thomas-QM),\n[@loganran](https://github.com/loganran),\n[@loginnotsecure](https://github.com/loginnotsecure),\n[@shalvah](https://github.com/shalvah),\n[@TruckMangione](https://github.com/TruckMangione),\n[@lordvlad](https://github.com/lordvlad),\n[@tango409](https://github.com/tango409),\n[@Freyam](https://github.com/Freyam),\n[@MulverineX](https://github.com/MulverineX),\n[@fernandex00](https://github.com/fernandex00),\nand others.\n'
