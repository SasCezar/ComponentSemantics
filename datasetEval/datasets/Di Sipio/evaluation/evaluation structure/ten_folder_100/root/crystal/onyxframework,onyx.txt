It has the following goals:\n\n* **Joy** for newcomers, yet an ability to scale with the developer\'s knowledge\n* **Type-safety** on top of Crystal\'s amazing built-in type system\n* **Performance** having minimum possible overhead\n\nThe framework consists of the following loosely coupled components:\n\n* [Onyx::HTTP](https://github.com/onyxframework/http) to build scalable web applications\n* [Onyx::SQL](https://github.com/onyxframework/sql) to add SQL models to your business layer\n* [Onyx::EDA](https://github.com/onyxframework/eda) to implement events-based reactivity\n\n## Supporters \xf0\x9f\x95\x8a\n\nThanks to all these patrons, the framework lives and prospers \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\n\n[Lauri Jutila](https://github.com/ljuti), [Alexander Maslov](https://seendex.ru), Anton Yordanov, Dainel Vera\n\n*You can become a patron too in exchange of prioritized support and other perks*\n\n<a href="https://www.patreon.com/vladfaust"><img height="50" src="https://onyxframework.org/img/patreon-button.svg"></a>\n\n## Installation \xf0\x9f\x93\xa5\n\nAdd this to your application\'s `shard.yml`:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  onyx:\n    github: onyxframework/onyx\n    version: ~> 0.6.0\n```\n\nThis shard follows [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](http://semver.org/), so check [releases](https://github.com/onyxframework/rest/releases) and change the `version` accordingly.\n\n> Note that until Crystal is officially released, this shard would be in beta state (`0.*.*`), with every **minor** release considered breaking. For example, `0.1.0` \xe2\x86\x92 `0.2.0` is breaking and `0.1.0` \xe2\x86\x92 `0.1.1` is not.\n\nNote that this shard does **not** have implicit dependencies for other framework components. For example, to use `"onyx/http"` macros, you must add `onyx-http` dependendency as well:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  onyx:\n    github: onyxframework/onyx\n    version: ~> 0.6.0\n  onyx-http:\n    github: onyxframework/http\n    version: ~> 0.9.0\n```\n\n## Documentation \xf0\x9f\x93\x9a\n\nThe documentation is available online at [docs.onyxframework.org](https://docs.onyxframework.org).\n\n## Community \xf0\x9f\x8d\xaa\n\nThere are multiple places to talk about this particular shard and about other ones as well:\n\n* [Gitter](https://gitter.im/onyxframework/Lobby)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onyxframework)\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
