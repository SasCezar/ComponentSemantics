There can be breaking changes but we're trying to keep them as minimum as possible.\n\nThe development is possible thanks to the community's effort, [84codes](https://www.84codes.com/)' support, and every [BountySource supporter](https://crystal-lang.org/sponsors).\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\n[Follow these instructions](https://crystal-lang.org/install)\n\nTry it online\n-------------\n\n[play.crystal-lang.org](https://play.crystal-lang.org/)\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n* [Language Reference](http://crystal-lang.org/reference)\n* [Standard library API](https://crystal-lang.org/api)\n* [Roadmap](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/wiki/Roadmap)\n\nCommunity\n---------\n\nQuestions or suggestions?
