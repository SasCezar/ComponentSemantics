b"# Prax\n\nRack proxy server for development\n\nThis is an (almost) complete rewrite of [Prax](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/prax)\nin [Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org), a Ruby-inspired language that compiles\ndown to LLVM. This version should avoid problems with version managers, since Prax\nis now a binary application that don't rely on Ruby anymore (except for Rack and\n`rackup`).\n\nPlease refer to the wiki for more information:\n\n- [User Guide](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/prax.cr/wiki/User-Guide)\n\n\n## Install\n\nYou can download a Debian / Ubuntu package for 64bits kernel on the\n[releases page](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/prax.cr/releases).\nFor other systems, you'll have to follow the\n[Manual Install Guide](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/prax.cr/wiki/Manual-Install-Guide).\n\n\n## How it works\n\n1. resolves `*.test` and `*.localhost` domains to `127.0.0.1` and `::1` (localhost);\n2. redirects the :80 and :443 ports to :20559 and :20558;\n3. receives incoming HTTP requests and extracts the hostname (eg: `myapp.test`);\n4. serves static files directly if they exist;\n4. otherwise spawns a Rack applications (found at `~/.prax/myapp`) if any;\n5. and proxies the request to the Rack aplication or a specified port for port forwarding.\n\n## Domain Resolver\n\n### systemd\n\nIf your distribution uses `systemd-resolved`, just use the `.localhost` TLD\ninstead of `.test` \xe2\x80\x94be prepared to fight against systemd if you want to use\nanother TLD, or consider switching to a systemd free Linux.\n\n### `.test` TLD\n\nPrax proposes 2 solutions to resolve `.test` and `.localhost` domains:\n\n- a dnsmasq configuration, either throught NetworkManager or by installing\n  dnsmasq manually (eg. through your Linux distribution package);\n- an obsolete and deprecated NSSwitch extension, only compatible wih glibc\n  and no longer compatible with Google Chrome/Chromium, and certainly more.\n\n### xip.io\n\nPrax supports http://xip.io/ domains, so you can use `myapp.129.168.0.1.xip.io`\nfor example. This is useful when using an external device like a smartphone,\ntablet or another computer to test your websites on.\n\n### Custom TLD\n\nIf `.test` or `.localhost` domains are not your cup of tea, no problem! Prax\nwill route requests from any TLD to the applications in your `~/.prax`\ndirectory, as long as the domain resolves to localhost.\n\nFor instance, if you wished to visit `myapp.dev` instead of `myapp.test`, you\ncould create dnsmasq configuration to resolve `.dev` domains to localhost, too:\n\n```\n$ sudo tee /etc/dnsmasq.d/dev <<EOF\nlocal=/dev/\naddress=/dev/127.0.0.1\naddress=/dev/::1\nEOF\n$ sudo service dnsmasq restart\n```\n\n\n## Port Redirections\n\nThe port redirections are iptables rules, that are installed and removed using\nan initd script. The script redirects the port :80 and :443 on 127.0.0.1 and for\neach `wlanX` and `ethX` devices found on your machine, to allow incoming\ntraffic, so you can use http://xip.io to test on external devices, as mentioned\nabove.\n\nYou can install or remove the redirections with:\n\n```console\n$ prax iptables [start|stop|restart|status]\n```\n\nDistribution packages should configure an init service to always install the\niptables rules on machine startup or before starting prax (warning: this\nrequires root privileges).\n\n\n## License\n\nPrax is distributed under the [CeCILL 2.1 license](http://www.cecill.info).\nPlease see LICENSE for details.\n\nHTML templates for rendering errors are from [Pow!!](http://pow.cx/), by Sam\nStephenson and Basecamp, and are under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\nThe NSSwitch extension originaly come from [Hoof](https://github.com/pyromaniac/hoof),\nby pyromaniac, and is under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n\n## Credits\n\n- Julien Portalier <julien@portalier.com>\n\nPrax wouldn't exist without [Pow!!](http://pow.cx) by Sam Stephenson and\nBasecamp.
