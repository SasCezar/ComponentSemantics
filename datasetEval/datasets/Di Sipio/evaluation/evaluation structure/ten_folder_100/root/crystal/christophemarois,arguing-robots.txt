b"# \xf0\x9f\xa4\x96 Arguing robots \xf0\x9f\xa4\x96\n\nArguing robots is a simple CLI utility for macOS that allow the wonderfully expressive [PlainTalk](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/PlainTalk) voices of macOS (including beloved *whisper* voice of [Lain](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Serial_Experiments_Lain)'s Navi) to come to life in your terminal. It also was my Hello World project for learning [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).\n\n![How to use arguing robots](how-to.gif)\n\n## Available voices\n\nType `say -v '?'` in your terminal to get a list of all available voices\n\n## Usage\n\n* Download the [CLI](https://github.com/christophemarois/arguing-robots/raw/master/arguing-robots)\n* Make a `.txt` containing dialogue lines in the following format: `[voice]: [text]`\xc2\xa0, like this one:\n\n```\nAlex: Hi, how are you doing?\nKaren: I'm good! How about you?\nAlex: Good. I've been thinking about this city today.\nVictoria: Really? How so?\nKaren: Oh, Victoria, you're here!\nVictoria: Yes, I arrived two minutes ago.\nKaren: So what about this city, Alex?\nAlex: It's just...\nAlex: How Montreal in the winter inspires people to do art.\n```\n\n* Pass the txt as an argument to the CLI (you can also open a terminal, drag the CLI on it, then drag the txt, then press enter):\n\n```\n./arguing-robots examples/montreal-in-the-winter.txt\n```\n\n* Hear and watch robots argue\n\n---\n\n**Whisper:** Who is Lain?\n\n![Lain's Navi](lain_navi.jpg)\n"
