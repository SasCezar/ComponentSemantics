b'# Crystal Programming Language\n\nThis is the language reference for the Crystal programming language.\n\nCrystal is a programming language with the following goals:\n\n* Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal).\n* Be statically type-checked, but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.\n* Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.\n* Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.\n* Compile to efficient native code.\n\n**Crystal\'s standard library is documented in the [API docs](https://crystal-lang.org/api).**\n\n## Contributing to the Language Reference\n\nDo you consider yourself a helpful person? If you find bugs or sections\nwhich need more clarification you\'re welcome to contribute to this\nlanguage reference. You can submit a pull request to this repository:\nhttps://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-book\n\nThank you very much!\n\n### Building and Serving Locally\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-book.git\n$ cd crystal-book\n$ npm install -g gitbook-cli@2.3.0\n$ npm install\n$ gitbook install\n$ gitbook serve\nLive reload server started on port: 35729\nPress CTRL+C to quit ...\n\ninfo: 8 plugins are installed\ninfo: loading plugin "ga"... OK\n...\nStarting server ...\nServing book on http://localhost:4000\n\n```\n\nHtml output will be in `_book` folder (some links won\'t work if opening the files locally).\nThere is also a docker environment to avoid installing dependencies globally:\n\n```\n$ docker-compose up\n...\ngitbook_1  | Starting server ...\ngitbook_1  | Serving book on http://localhost:4000\ngitbook_1  | Restart after change in file node_modules/.bin\n...\n```\n\n### Adding a page\n\nTo add a page, create a markdown file in the desired location. Example: `overview/hello_world.md`. Then, add a link in the `SUMMARY.md` file which acts as the navigation for the language reference.\n'
