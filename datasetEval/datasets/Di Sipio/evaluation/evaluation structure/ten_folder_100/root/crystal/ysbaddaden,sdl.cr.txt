b"# SDL2 bindings for Crystal\n\nWrite SDL2 games in Crystal. Support for desktop applications for now, but\nAndroid shouldn't be hard to achieve.\n\nMost of the bindings have been implemented, though most haven't been verified,\nyet. Please see the `samples` directory for examples, ported from the tutorials\nfound at <http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php>. You are welcome to port\nmore samples, and the necessary corrections!\n\n## Requirements\n\n- SDL2 is required;\n- Optional bindings for `SDL2_Mixer`, `SDL2_Image` and `SDL2_TTF`;\n- Crystal > 0.22.0 is required for `SDL2_Mixer` to work correctly.\n"
