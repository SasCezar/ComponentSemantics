My primary goal was to learn how to teach\na machine what my language looks like and what it should do.\nBased on the experiences I\'ve made while working on Charly, I now feel comfortable\nto experiment with lower-level technology such as virtual machines or compilers.\n\nThis implementation uses a tree-based execution model, which is (as opposed to a bytecode interpreter) rather\ntrivial to implement. Given that I never took any classes or read any books about this topic,\nit was the easiest way for me to put up a working language. Charly might well switch to a bytecode-interpreter\nin the future, but only once I\'ve gathered enough experience to feel comfortable with writing a virtual-machine\nfor it.\n\n> If you\'re interested in writing your own programming language, I\'ve compiled a list of resources\nyou may find useful.\n\n- [Compiler Design with Alex Aiken from Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFB9EC7B8FE963EB8)\n- [The Crystal Compiler](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/tree/master/src/compiler)\n- [Implementing Languages by Christopher Pitt](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDjkcYOLgGdggfm9uVaopOueu1EheD4aN)\n- [Writing a virtual machine by Terence Parr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjaAToVkoTw)\n\n# Syntax and language guide\n\nVisit the [website](https://charly-lang.github.io/charly) for an introduction to the language.\n\n# Installation\n\n1. Install [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org)\n2. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/charly-lang/charly`\n3. Run `install.sh`\n\nYou will be prompted for your admin password (used to copy to `/usr/local/bin`).\n\nAfter that you need to set the `CHARLYDIR` environment variable. Just add the following line to your\n`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc. Replace the path with the path to the Charly source code (e.g The path to the git repo).\n\n```bash\nexport CHARLYDIR=~/GitHub/charly-lang/charly\n```\n\nYou can also build the interpreter via the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir bin\n$ crystal build src/charly.cr --release -o bin/charly\n```\n\nThis will place the executable in the `bin` folder.\n\n# OS Support\n\nI\'m developing on macOS 10.12 so it should work without any problems on that.\nThe [CI Build](https://travis-ci.org/charly-lang/charly) runs on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS.\n\n# CLI options\n\n```\n$ charly -v\nCharly 0.3.0 [bb5b857] (15.
