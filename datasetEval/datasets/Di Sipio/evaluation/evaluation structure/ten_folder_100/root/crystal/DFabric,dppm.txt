Get the `dppm` binary\n\nThere are 3 methods:\n\n- Automatic\n\nDownload `dppm` with the helper:\n\n`sh -c "APP=dppm-static $(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DFabric/apps-static/master/helper.sh)"`\n\n(`wget -qO-` can be replaced by `curl -s`)\n\nThe binary is `bin/dppm` in the directory.\n\n- Manual\n\nGet [the pre-compiled binary](https://bintray.com/dfabric/apps-static/builds#files) called `dppm-static_*`, and extract it.\n\n- Clone the repository and compile the project\n\nSee the `Development` section\n\n### 2. Run the installation command\n\n`sudo bin/dppm app install`\n\nYou don\'t *need* to install it as root, but no system services nor dedicated users will be available. You will have to rely on `sudo dppm app exec`\n\n## Usage\n\nTo show the help:\n\n`dppm --help`\n\nTo list [available packages](https://github.com/DFabric/package-sources) (applications, built and available packages):\n\n`dppm list`\n\nA typical installation can be:\n\n```sh\n# add a new application to the system\nsudo dppm app add [application]\n\n# start the service and auto start the service at boot\nsudo dppm service start [application]\nsudo dppm service boot [application] true\n```\n\nIf not specified, an user, group and application name will be created.\n\nNote that `add` will `build` the missing required packages.\n\nRoot execution is needed to add a system service (systemd or OpenRC)\n\nTo show the services status:\n\n`dppm service status`\n\nTo follow last application logs:\n\n`sudo dppm logs [application] output`\n\n## Uninstall\n\n`sudo dppm app uninstall`\n\n## Supported environments\n\nSupported architectures are `x86-64` and `arm64` (thanks to [@jirutka](https://github.com/jirutka)).\n\n32-bit architectures are partially supported, but discouraged since nowadays more and more applications are designed for 64-bit, particularly databases ([TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/5224), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/32-bit-limitations)...)\n\nFor Rapberry Pi 3, a 64-bit OS like [Armbian](https://www.armbian.com/) is recommended, and needed to run DPPM, instead of a 32-bit Raspbian.\n\nStill, [an issue is open](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/5467) for `armhf`.\n\n## Development\n\nYou will need a [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) development environment\n\nYou can either [install it](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation) or use a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jrei/crystal-alpine)\n\nYou may also find useful this variables `config=./config.con` and `source=../packages-source`\n\n### How to build\n\nInstall dependencies and build `dppm`:\n\n`shards build`\n\nRun it\n\n`bin/dppm --help`\n\nFor more informations, see the [official docs](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/using_the_compiler/)\n\n### Run tests\n\nIntegration tests are stateful and need to be runned all in a batch sequentially.\n\nTo run them: `crystal spec spec/integration_spec.cr`\n\nOther tests are stateless and can be runned independently to each other\n\nTo run all tests: `crystal spec`\n\n## License                                                                                                 \n\nCopyright (c) 2018-2019 Julien Reichardt - ISC License\n'
