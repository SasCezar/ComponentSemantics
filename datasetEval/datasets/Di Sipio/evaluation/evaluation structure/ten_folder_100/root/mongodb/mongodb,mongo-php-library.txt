b'# MongoDB PHP Library\n\n[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/mongodb/mongo-php-library.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mongodb/mongo-php-library)\n\nThis library provides a high-level abstraction around the lower-level\n[PHP driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver) (`mongodb` extension).\n\nWhile the extension provides a limited API for executing commands, queries, and\nwrite operations, this library implements an API similar to that of the\n[legacy PHP driver](https://php.net/manual/en/book.mongo.php). It contains\nabstractions for client, database, and collection objects, and provides methods\nfor CRUD operations and common commands (e.g. index and collection management).\n\nIf you are developing an application with MongoDB, you should consider using\nthis library, or another high-level abstraction, instead of the extension alone.\n\nAdditional information about the architecture of this library and the `mongodb`\nextension may be found in\n[Architecture Overview](https://php.net/manual/en/mongodb.overview.php).\n\n## Documentation\n\n - https://docs.mongodb.com/php-library/\n - https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/php/\n\n## Installation\n\nThe preferred method of installing this library is with\n[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) by running the following from your project\nroot:\n\n    $ composer require mongodb/mongodb\n\nAdditional installation instructions may be found in the\n[library documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/php-library/current/tutorial/install-php-library/).\n\nSince this library is a high-level abstraction for the driver, it also requires\nthat the `mongodb` extension be installed:\n\n    $ pecl install mongodb\n    $ echo "extension=mongodb.so" >> `php --ini | grep "Loaded Configuration" | sed -e "s|.*:\\s*||"`\n\nAdditional installation instructions for the extension may be found in its\n[PHP.net documentation](https://php.net/manual/en/mongodb.installation.php).\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nIssues pertaining to the library should be reported in the\n[PHPLIB](https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?project-field=PHPLIB)\nproject in MongoDB\'s JIRA. Extension-related issues should be reported in the\n[PHPC](https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?project-field=PHPC)\nproject.\n\nFor general questions and support requests, please use one of MongoDB\'s\n[Technical Support](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/support/) channels.\n\n### Security Vulnerabilities\n\nIf you\'ve identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other MongoDB\nproject, please report it according to the instructions in\n[Create a Vulnerability Report](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report).\n\n## Development\n\nDevelopment is tracked in the\n[PHPLIB](https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/PHPLIB/summary) project in MongoDB\'s\nJIRA. Documentation for contributing to this project may be found in\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n'
