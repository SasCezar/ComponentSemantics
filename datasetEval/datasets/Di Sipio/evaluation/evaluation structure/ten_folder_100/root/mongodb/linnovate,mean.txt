b"## Welcome to the mean stack\n\nThe mean stack is intended to provide a simple and fun starting point for cloud native fullstack javascript applications.   \nMEAN is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications; starting from the top (code running in the browser) to the bottom (database). The stack is made up of:\n\n- **M**ongoDB : Document database \xe2\x80\x93 used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents\n- **E**xpress (sometimes referred to as Express.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js\n- **A**ngular (formerly Angular.js): Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic\n- **N**ode.js : JavaScript runtime environment \xe2\x80\x93 lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript\n\n### Pre-requisites\n* git - [Installation guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/) .  \n* node.js - [Download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) .  \n* npm - comes with node or download yarn - [Download page](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) .  \n* mongodb - [Download page](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) .  \n\n### Installation \n``` \ngit clone https://github.com/linnovate/mean\ncd mean\ncp .env.example .env\nnpm install\nnpm start (for development)\n```\n### Docker based \n``` \ngit clone https://github.com/linnovate/mean\ncd mean\ncp .env.example .env\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n### Credits \n- The MEAN name was coined by Valeri Karpov.\n- Initial concept and development was done by Amos Haviv and sponsered by Linnovate.\n- Inspired by the great work of Madhusudhan Srinivasa.\n"
