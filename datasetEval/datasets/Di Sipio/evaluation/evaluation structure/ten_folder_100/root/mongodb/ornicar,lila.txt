Don\'t expect developers to help you run your own instance. Questions about the installation and runtime issues will probably be ignored.\n\nHTTP API\n--------\n\nFeel free to use the [Lichess API](https://lichess.org/api) in your applications and websites.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nSee the [contributors](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/graphs/contributors) on this repository and [lichess.org/thanks](https://lichess.org/thanks).\n\nSupported browsers\n------------------\n\n| Name              | Version | Notes |\n| ----------------- | ------- | ----- |\n| Chromium / Chrome | last 10 | Full support, fastest local analysis |\n| Firefox           | 55+     | Full support, second fastest local analysis |\n| Safari            | 10.1+   | Reasonable support |\n| Opera             | 55+     | Reasonable support |\n| Edge              | 17+     | Reasonable support |\n\nOlder browsers (including any version of Internet Explorer) will not work.\nFor your own sake, please upgrade.
