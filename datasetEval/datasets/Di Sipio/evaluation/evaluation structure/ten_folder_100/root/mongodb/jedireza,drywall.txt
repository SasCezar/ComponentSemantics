b"# We moved!\n\n[Aqua](https://github.com/jedireza/aqua) is what you're looking for.\n\nAlso take a look at [Frame](https://github.com/jedireza/frame), which is just\nthe restful API parts of Aqua, bring your own front-end.\n\n\n## Why the change?\n\nDrywall started as my first Node.js project. It was published on [Dec 20th,\n2012](https://github.com/jedireza/drywall/tree/ac07c05c146ca52c9e26d4d60c63052364211087).\nI've learned a lot since then, especially about testing, which Drywall never\ngot. And (at the time of writing) I'm a bigger fan of\n[hapi](http://hapijs.com/) than [express](http://expressjs.com/).\n\n\n## Thank you\n\nThank you so much for your interest in my projects.\n\n\n## Where's the old README?\n\n[Right over here](README-original.md)\n"
