b'# Admin Bro\n\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro)\n\n[AdminBro](https://softwarebrothers.github.io/admin-bro-dev/) is An automatic admin interface which can be plugged into your application. You, as a developer, provide database models (like posts, comments, stores, products or whatever else your application uses), and AdminBro generates UI which allows you (or other trusted users) to manage content.\n\nInspired by: [django admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com), [rails admin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin) and [active admin](https://activeadmin.info/).\n\n## How it looks\n\n<img src=\'./docs/anim.gif\'>\n\n## Example application\n\nCheck out the example application with mongodb and postgres models here:\n\n- login: `test@example.com`\n- password: `password`\n\nhttps://admin-bro-example-app.herokuapp.com/admin\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- Check out the [documentation](https://softwarebrothers.github.io/admin-bro-dev/)\n- Try the [live demo](https://admin-bro-example-app.herokuapp.com/admin) as mentioned above\n\n# What kind of problems it solves\n\nSo you have a working service built in Node.js. It uses (for example) [Hapi.js](https://hapijs.com/) for rendering a couple of REST routes and [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as the _connector_ to the database.\n\nEverything works fine, but now you would like to:\n* see all the data in the app,\n* perform custom _business_ actions on objects in the database,\n* bootstrap the tables with the _initial_ data,\n* build custom report pages,\n* allow other team members (not necessary programmers) to see what is going on in the application.\n\nAnd all these cases can be solved by AdminBro. By adding couple of lines of code you have a running admin interface.\n\n# Features\n\n* CRUD any data in any resource\n* Custom actions\n* Form validation based on schema in your resources\n* Full featured dashboard with widgets\n* Custom resource decorators\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you would like work on an admin-bro and develop new features - take a look at our dev repository: https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/admin-bro-dev\n\nYou can find there instructions on how to run admin-bro for development.\n\n## License\n\nAdminBro is Copyright \xc2\xa9 2018 SoftwareBrothers.co.
