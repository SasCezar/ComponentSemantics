Use the Django Admin GUI to add and modify documents in MongoDB. \n\n## Usage:\n<ol>\n<li> Install djongo:\n\n``` \npip install djongo\n```\n</li>\n<li> Into settings.py file of your project, add: \n\n```python\nDATABASES = {\n    \'default\': {\n        \'ENGINE\': \'djongo\',\n        \'NAME\': \'your-db-name\',\n        \'HOST\': \'your-db-host\',\n    }\n}\n```\n</li>   \n   <li> Run <code>manage.py makemigrations &ltapp_name&gt </code> followed by <code>manage.py migrate</code> (ONLY the first time to create collections in mongoDB) </li>\n   <li> YOUR ARE SET! HAVE FUN! </li>\n</ol>\n\n## Requirements:\n\n  1. Python 3.6 or higher.\n  2. MongoDB 3.4 or higher.\n  3. If your models use nested queries or sub querysets like:\n  \n      ```python\n      inner_qs = Blog.objects.filter(name__contains=\'Ch\').values(\'name\')\n      entries = Entry.objects.filter(blog__name__in=inner_qs)\n      ```\n     MongoDB 3.6 or higher is required.\n\n## Dear Supporter\n\nI am inundated daily with your love, appreciation, queries and feature requests for Djongo. Djongo has grown into more than a simple hobby project of an individual developer. Visit my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/nesdis) to understand the different levels of support and services you can get.\n\n## How it works\n\ndjongo is a SQL to mongodb query compiler. It translates a SQL query string into a mongoDB query document. As a result, all Django features, models etc work as is.\n  \n  Django contrib modules: \n<pre><code>  \n\'django.contrib.admin\',\n\'django.contrib.auth\',    \n\'django.contrib.sessions\',\n\n</code></pre>\n and others... fully supported.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Use Django Admin GUI to access MongoDB.  \n  * Embedded Model.\n  * Embedded Array.\n  * Embedded Form Fields.\n  \n  Read the [full documentation](https://nesdis.github.io/djongo/)\n  \n## Contribute\n \n If you think djongo is useful, **please share it** with the world!
