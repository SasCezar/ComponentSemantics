b'# Build a NodeJS microservice and deploy it to Docker\n\n![](./cover.png)\n\nThis is the repo example for the article.\n\n### Stack\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll use a simple NodeJS service with a MongoDB for our backend.\n- NodeJS 7.5.0\n- MongoDB 3.4.2\n- Docker for Mac 1.13.0\n\n### Microservices\n\n- [Movies Service example](./movies-service)\n- [Cinema Catalog Service example](./cinema-catalog-service)\n- [Booking Service example](./booking-service)\n- [Payment Service example](./payment-service)\n- [Notification Service example](./notification-service)\n- [API Gateway Service example](./api-gateway)\n\n### How to run the cinema microservice\n\nWe need to have docker installed previously.\n\n```\n$ bash < kraken.sh\n```\n\nThis will basically install every microservice and setup the docker swarm cluster\n\nand deploy every docker service in the swarm.\n\nTo monitor the cluster in a graphic mode we can go and visit the following url: `http://192.168.99.100:9000`\n\nand this will give us the rancherOS web interface.\n\n### Blog posts\n\n- [Build a NodeJS cinema microservice and deploying it with docker (part 1)](https://medium.com/@cramirez92/build-a-nodejs-cinema-microservice-and-deploying-it-with-docker-part-1-7e28e25bfa8b)\n- [Build a NodeJS cinema microservice and deploying it with docker (part 2)](https://medium.com/@cramirez92/build-a-nodejs-cinema-microservice-and-deploying-it-with-docker-part-2-e05cc7b126e0)\n- [Build a NodeJS cinema booking microservice and deploying it with docker (part 3)](https://medium.com/@cramirez92/build-a-nodejs-cinema-booking-microservice-and-deploying-it-with-docker-part-3-9c384e21fbe0)\n- [Build a NodeJS cinema microservice and deploying it with docker (part 4)](https://medium.com/@cramirez92/build-a-nodejs-cinema-api-gateway-and-deploying-it-to-docker-part-4-703c2b0dd269#.en6g5buwl)\n- [Deploy a Nodejs microservices to a Docker Swarm Cluster (Docker from zero to\xc2\xa0hero)](https://medium.com/@cramirez92/deploy-a-nodejs-microservices-to-a-docker-swarm-cluster-docker-from-zero-to-hero-464fa1369ea0#.548ni3uxv)\n\n### LICENSE\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Cristian Ramirez\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
