See `#246\n<https://github.com/ptpb/pb/issues/246>`_ for details.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* full paste and short-url CRUD\n* private pastes\n* tweakable syntax highlighting\n* terminal recording playback\n* markup rendering\n\nSuggested versions\n------------------\n\n- python >= 3.6\n- mongodb >= 3.2\n- docker >= 17.04\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\npb comes with a ``Dockerfile`` and ``docker-compose.yaml`` to start development\nenvironments easily. Refer to relevant documentation for how to install ``docker``\nand ``docker-compose``.\n\nstart pb with::\n\n  docker-compose up\n\npb will be listening on ``http://localhost:10002``\n\nDeployment\n----------\n\nptpb.pw (the reference deployment) uses `ptpb-deploy\n<https://github.com/ptpb/ptpb-deploy>`_, which includes TLS termination,\nautomatic x509 certificate rotation, and response caching.\n\nFor a simpler deployment, the included ``Dockerfile`` and\n``docker-compose.yaml`` can be used verbatim, and are easy to read/study.\n\nOther best practices include:\n\n- not using a shared/system python, when this is shared with packages other than pb\n\n  - using site-packages is fine/preferred inside a container or isolated\n    filesystem, otherwise use `venv\n    <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_\n\n  - if you need/want a version of python other than what your distribution\n    packages, `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ is a good option\n\n- not using debian or centos\n\n  - these provide severely outdated packages, and require additional work to\n    compensate for this\n'
