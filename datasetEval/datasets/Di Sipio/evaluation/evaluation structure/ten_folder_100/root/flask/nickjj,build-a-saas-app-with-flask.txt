b'## Welcome to The Build a SAAS App with Flask Course!\n\n*A video course where we build a real world web application with Flask, Celery,\nRedis, PostgreSQL, Stripe and Docker.*\n\n**Full details on the course can be found here:**  \n[https://buildasaasappwithflask.com](https://buildasaasappwithflask.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=bsawf&utm_campaign=readme-top)\n\n### Getting started\n\n```sh\ncp .env.example .env\ndocker-compose up --build\n```\n\n### How does this source code differ than what\'s in the course?\n\nIn the course we build up a 4,000+ line Flask application in 15 stages while I\'m\nat your side explaining my thought process along the way.\n\nYou will get to see the source code grow from a single `app.py` file to a large\ncode base that spans across dozens of files and folders.\n\n#### This repo includes up to the 6th stage. By this point in the code base, you\'ll be introduced to concepts such as:\n\n- Using Docker to "Dockerize" a multi-service Flask app\n- Using Flask extensions\n- Flask blueprints\n- Jinja templates\n- Working with forms\n- Sending e-mails through Celery\n- Creating Click based CLI scripts\n- Testing and analyzing your code base\n\n#### The rest of the course covers topics such as:\n\n- What is Docker and how can you use it?\n- Going over the application\'s architecture and tech choices\n- Creating a full blown user management system\n- Creating a custom admin dashboard\n- Logging, middleware and error handling\n- Adding quality of life improvements to the CLI script\n- Accepting recurring credit card payments with Stripe\n- Building up a dice game called "Snake Eyes"\n- Responding with JSON from Flask and creating AJAX requests\n- Processing microtransaction payments with Stripe\n- Dealing with database migrations\n- Converting your app to support multiple languages (i18n)\n\n**By the time you finish the course, you\'ll have all the confidence you need to\nbuild a large web application with Flask**.\n\n---\n\nThere\'s over 173 video lessons, 15+ hours of content, coding exercises and an\ne-book that\'s included.\n\nAlso as a bonus, there\'s an additional 18 video lessons and 3 hours of content\nthat covers building a separate RESTful API driven application that uses web sockets.\n\n**Everything you\'d want to know about the course can be found here:**  \n[https://buildasaasappwithflask.com](https://buildasaasappwithflask.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=bsawf&utm_campaign=readme-bottom)\n'
