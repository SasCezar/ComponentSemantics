b"Explore Flask\n=============\n\nWelcome to the *Explore Flask* repository. This is where the reStructuredText\nsource of the book lives. If you're looking to read the book itself, `go here\n<http://exploreflask.com>`_.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nIf you have some ideas for the book, you can open up an issue in the issue tracker\nor submit a pull request. If you're making some big changes, it's probably best\nto suggest them first in the issue tracker so we can discuss whether or not they\nbelong in the book before you do all of the work.\n\nContributions are all placed in the public domain like the rest of the text.\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\nJust ``cd`` into the repo and run ``sphinx-build -b html source/ build/`` to build\nthe website. Feel free to try your hand at building other formats, but HTML is\nthe only officially supported one right now."
