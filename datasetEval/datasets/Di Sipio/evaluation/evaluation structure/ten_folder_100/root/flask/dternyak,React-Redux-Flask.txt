b'# React-Redux-Flask #\n\nBoilerplate application for a Flask JWT Backend and a React/Redux Front-End with Material UI.\n\n* Python 2.7+ or 3.x\n* Pytest\n* Heroku\n* Flask\n* React\n* Redux\n* React-Router 2.0\n* React-Router-Redux\n* Babel 6\n* SCSS processing\n* Webpack\n\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ZIS4qkw.png)\n\n### Create DB\n```sh\n$ export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost/mydatabase"\n\nor\n\n$ export DATABASE_URL="mysql+mysqlconnector://username:password@localhost/mydatabase"\n\nor\n\n$ export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///your.db"\n```\n(More about connection strings in this [flask config guide](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.1/config/).)\n```\n$ python manage.py create_db\n$ python manage.py db upgrade\n$ python manage.py db migrate\n```\n\nTo update database after creating new migrations, use:\n\n```sh\n$ python manage.py db upgrade\n```\n\n### Install Front-End Requirements\n```sh\n$ cd static\n$ npm install\n```\n\n### Run Back-End\n\n```sh\n$ python manage.py runserver\n```\n\n### Test Back-End\n\n```sh\n$ python test.py --cov-report=term --cov-report=html --cov=application/ tests/\n```\n\n### Run Front-End\n\n```sh\n$ cd static\n$ npm start\n```\n\n### Build Front-End\n\n```sh\n$ npm run build:production\n```\n\n### New to Python?\n\nIf you are approaching this demo as primarily a frontend dev with limited or no python experience, you may need to install a few things that a seasoned python dev would already have installed.\n\nMost Macs already have python 2.7 installed but you may not have pip install. You can check to see if you have them installed:\n\n```\n$ python --version\n$ pip --version \n```\n\nIf pip is not installed, you can follow this simple article to [get both homebrew and python](https://howchoo.com/g/mze4ntbknjk/install-pip-on-mac-os-x)\n\nAfter you install python, you can optionally also install python 3\n\n```\n$ brew install python3\n```\n\nNow you can check again to see if both python and pip are installed. Once pip is installed, you can download the required flask modules:\n\n```\n$ sudo pip install flask flask_script flask_migrate flask_bcrypt \n```\n\nNow, you can decide on which database you wish to use. \n\n#### New to MySQL? \n\nIf you decide on MySQL, install the free community edition of [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)\n\n1. start MySQL from the System Preferences\n2. open MySQL Workbench and [create a database](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5515745/create-a-new-database-with-mysql-workbench) called mydatabase but don\'t create the tables since python will do that for you\n3. Install the MySQL connector for Python, add the DATABASE_URL configuration, and create the database and tables\n\n```\n$ sudo pip install mysql-connector-python-rf\n$ export DATABASE_URL="mysql+mysqlconnector://username:password@localhost/mydatabase"\n$ python manage.py create_db\n```\n\nNote: you do not need to run "python manage.py db upgrade" or "python manage.py db migrate" if its your first go at it\n\n4. Run Back-End\n\n```\n$ python manage.py runserver\n```\n\nIf all goes well, you should see ```* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)``` followed by a few more lines in the terminal.\n\n5. open a new tab to the same directory and run the front end\n\n```\n$ cd static\n$ npm install\n$ npm start\n```\n\n6. open your browser to http://localhost:3000/register and setup your first account\n7. enjoy! By this point, you should be able to create an account and login without errors. \n\n\n\n\n'
