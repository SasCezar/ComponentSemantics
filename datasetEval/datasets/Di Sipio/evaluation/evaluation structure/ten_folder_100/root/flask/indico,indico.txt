We try to target all modern browsers as\nmuch as possible, but only issues detected on those will be considered at critical level.\n\n<!-- BROWSERS - this is all machine-generated!

You can be the next one - read our\n[Contribution Guide](https://github.com/indico/indico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you\'d like to help out.\n\n**You don\'t need to know how to write code in order to help!**\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe full roadmap is [available on the project site](https://getindico.io/roadmap/).\n\n## Community\n\nThe main meeting points for the community are:\n * the [Project Forum](https://talk.getindico.io);\n * the Chat Room\n([#indico on Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=indico) or on [Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#indico:matrix.org)).\n\nWe follow [CERN\'s Values](https://hr-dep.web.cern.ch/content/cern-values-0) and the principles established by\n[CERN\'s Code of Conduct](https://hr-dep.web.cern.ch/content/code-of-conduct).\n\n## History\n\nThis software project was initially funded by the European Union\'s FP5 programme\xf0\x9f\x87\xaa\xf0\x9f\x87\xba, in what was called the [**In**tegrated **Di**gital **Co**nferencing Project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/61849/factsheet/en), or just **InDiCo**. CERN was responsible for the development of the "Make-a-Confererence" workpackage (inspired by an already existing system called **CDS Agenda**, also developed at the Organization) which would then become what we nowadays know as **Indico**.\n\nWe have since stopped using the ~~*InDiCo*~~ acronym, as it no longer reflects accurately the nature of the project. The word *Indico* now has no particular meaning other than the product\'s name.\n\n\n---\n\n\n|||\n|-|-|\n|<a href="https://home.cern"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indico/assets/master/cern_badge.png" width="64"></a>|Made at [CERN](https://home.cern)<br>[Take part!](https://careers.cern/)|\n|||\n\n> ### Note\n>\n> *In applying the MIT license, CERN does not waive the privileges and immunities\n> granted to it by virtue of its status as an Intergovernmental Organization\n> or submit itself to any jurisdiction.*\n'
