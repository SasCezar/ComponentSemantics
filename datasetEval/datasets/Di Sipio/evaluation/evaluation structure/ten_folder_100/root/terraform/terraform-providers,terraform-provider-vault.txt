b'Terraform Provider\n==================\n\n- Website: https://www.terraform.io\n- [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/hashicorp-terraform/Lobby.png)](https://gitter.im/hashicorp-terraform/Lobby)\n- Mailing list: [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/terraform-tool)\n\n<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/hashicorp/terraform-website/master/content/source/assets/images/logo-hashicorp.svg" width="600px">\n\nMaintainers\n-----------\n\nThis provider plugin is maintained by the Terraform team at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/).\n\nBest Practices\n--------------\n\nWe recommend that you avoid placing secrets in your Terraform config or state file wherever possible, and if placed there, you take steps to reduce and manage your risk. We have created a practical guide on how to do this with our opensource versions in Best Practices for Using HashiCorp Terraform with HashiCorp Vault:\n\n[![Best Practices for Using HashiCorp Terraform with HashiCorp Vault](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fOybhcbuxJ0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOybhcbuxJ0)\n\nThis webinar walks you through how to protect secrets when using Terraform with Vault. Additional security measures are available in paid Terraform versions as well.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n-\t[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.11.x\n-\t[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.11 (to build the provider plugin)\n\nBuilding The Provider\n---------------------\n\nClone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-vault`\n\n```sh\n$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers\n$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-vault\n```\n\nEnter the provider directory and build the provider\n\n```sh\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-vault\n$ make build\n```\n\nUsing the provider\n----------------------\n\nDeveloping the Provider\n---------------------------\n\nIf you wish to work on the provider, you\'ll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.11+ is *required*). You\'ll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.\n\nTo compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.\n\n```sh\n$ make build\n...\n$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-vault\n...\n```\n\nIn order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.\n\n```sh\n$ make test\n```\n\nIn order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.\n\n*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.\n\n```sh\n$ make testacc\n```\n'
