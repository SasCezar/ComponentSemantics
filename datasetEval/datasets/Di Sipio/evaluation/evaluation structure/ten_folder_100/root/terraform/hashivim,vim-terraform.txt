See the HashiVim home page for\nfurther information.\n- - - -\n# Overview: vim-terraform\n\nThis plugin adds a `:Terraform` command that runs terraform, with tab\ncompletion of subcommands. It also sets up `*.tf`, `*.tfvars`, and\n`*.tfstate` files to be highlighted as HCL, HCL, and JSON respectively.\n\n- - - -\n# Installation\n\nWith [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:\n\n    cd ~/.vim/bundle\n    git clone https://github.com/hashivim/vim-terraform.git\n\nFor [vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) users, add the following to `~/.vimrc`:\n\n    Plugin \'hashivim/vim-terraform\'\n\nIf you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.\n\n- - - -\n# Usage\n\nAllow vim-terraform to align settings automatically with Tabularize.\n\n    let g:terraform_align=1\n\nAllow vim-terraform to automatically fold (hide until unfolded) sections of terraform code. Defaults to 0 which is off.\n\n    let g:terraform_fold_sections=1\n\nAllow vim-terraform to automatically format `*.tf` and `*.tfvars` files with `terraform fmt`.\nYou can also do this manually with the `:TerraformFmt` command.\n\n    let g:terraform_fmt_on_save=1\n\n- - - -\n# Updating vim-terraform\nNote, this is only for maintainers of the `vim-terraform` project.\n\nWhen a new version of Terraform drops, you can run the following where x.x.x is a version such as 0.11.11\n\n    ./update_automagic.sh x.x.x\n\nAt this point, add the modified files to a git branch and open a pull request.\n\n\tgit checkout -b "feature/update-to-terraform-$VERSION"\n\tgit add $FILE\n\tgit commit -m "Message about update"\n\tgit push\n\nAdd another maintainer to the pull request and await confirmation.\n\n- - - -\n# Running tests\n\nTo run the test suite and verify functionality\n\n    make\n\n- - - -\n# Credits\n\nSyntax highlighting and indentation by Kevin Le (@bkad) based on prior work by\nLarry Gilbert (@L2G).
