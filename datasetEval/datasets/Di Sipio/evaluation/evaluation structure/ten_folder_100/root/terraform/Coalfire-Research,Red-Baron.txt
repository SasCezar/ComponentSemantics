b'Latest version of this project is now being maintained here: \n\nhttps://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/Red-Baron\n\n# Red Baron\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://orig00.deviantart.net/5aae/f/2016/085/0/5/bloody_baron_by_synestesi_art-d9wjp94.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="baron"/>\n</p>\n\n\nRed Baron is a set of [modules](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) and custom/third-party providers for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) which tries to automate creating resilient, disposable, secure and agile infrastructure for Red Teams.\n\n# Third-party Providers\n\nThis repository comes with a few pre-compiled [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) plugins (you can find them under the ```terraform.d``` directory), some of these have been modified to better suit the tool:\n\n- Linode Provider: https://github.com/LinodeContent/terraform-provider-linode\n- GoDaddy Provider: https://github.com/n3integration/terraform-godaddy\n\n# Author and Acknowledgments\n\nAuthor: Marcello Salvati ([@byt3bl33d3r](https://twitter.com/byt3bl33d3r))\n\nThe initial inspiration for this came from [@_RastaMouse\'s](https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse) excellent *\'Automated Red Team Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform\'* blog posts series:\n- [Part 1](https://rastamouse.me/2017/08/automated-red-team-infrastructure-deployment-with-terraform---part-1/)\n- [Part 2](https://rastamouse.me/2017/09/automated-red-team-infrastructure-deployment-with-terraform---part-2/)\n\nAnd [@bluscreenofjeff\'s](https://twitter.com/bluscreenofjeff) amazing [Red Team Infrastructure Wiki](https://github.com/bluscreenofjeff/Red-Team-Infrastructure-Wiki)\n\nBoth of these resources were referenced heavily while building this.\n\n# Setup\n\n**Red Baron only supports Terraform version 0.11.0 or newer and will only work on Linux x64 systems.** \n\n```\n#~ git clone https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/Red-Baron && cd Red-Baron\n#~ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="accesskey"\n#~ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="secretkey"\n#~ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"\n#~ export LINODE_API_KEY="apikey"\n#~ export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN="token"\n#~ export GODADDY_API_KEY="gdkey"\n#~ export GODADDY_API_SECRET="gdsecret"\n#~ export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="azure_subscription_id"\n#~ export ARM_CLIENT_ID="azure_app_id"\n#~ export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="azure_app_password"\n#~ export ARM_TENANT_ID="azure_tenant_id"\n\n# For Google Cloud Compute see https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html#configuration-reference \n# and set the appropriate environment variable for your use case\n\n# copy an infrastructure configuration file from the examples folder to the root directory and modify it to your needs\n#~ cp examples/complete_c2.tf .\n\n#~ terraform init\n#~ terraform plan\n#~ terraform apply\n```\n\n# Tool & Module Documentation\n\nFor detailed documentation on the tool and each module please see Red Baron\'s [wiki](https://github.com/coalfire/pentest-red-baron/wiki).\n\nMost of the documentation assumes you are familiar with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) itself, [Terraform\'s](https://www.terraform.io/) documentation can be found [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html).\n\n# Known Bugs/Limitations\n\n- SSH keys are deleted only when you explicitly run ```terraform destroy``` (https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13549)\n\n- Variables in provider fields are not supported which removes the ability to spin up AWS instances in different regions (https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11578)\n\n- A resources ```count``` parameter cannot be a dynamic value which means we must pass it as a module variable instead of inferring it from the length of the list we give it as a argument (https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14677)\n\n- ~LetsEncrypt cert creation using the TLS challenge currently doesn\'t work due to the third-party terraform ACME plugin implementation (https://github.com/paybyphone/terraform-provider-acme#using-http-and-tls-challenges). (I probably could get it to work with some extra tinkering)~\n\n- The GoDaddy modules replace **all** of the DNS entries instead of adding the specified record to the existing zone file due to the implementation of the third-party provider (https://github.com/n3integration/terraform-godaddy). (Not ideal and definitely need to work on this, but it will due for now)\n\n# License\n\nThis fork of the original Red Baron repository is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.\n'
