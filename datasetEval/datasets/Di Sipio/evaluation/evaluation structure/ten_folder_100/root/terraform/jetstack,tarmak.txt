b"![tarmak logo](/docs/static/logo-tarmak-400px.png)\n\n## What is Tarmak?\n\nTarmak is an open-source toolkit for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management\nthat focuses on best practice cluster security and cluster\nmanagement/operation. It has been built from the ground-up to be cloud\nprovider-agnostic and hence provides a means for consistent and reliable\ncluster deployment and management, across clouds and on-premises environments.\n\nTarmak and its underlying components are the product of\n[Jetstack](https://www.jetstack.io)'s work with  its customers to build and\ndeploy Kubernetes in production at scale.\n\nUnder-the-hood, Tarmak uses a number of well-known and proven components,\nincluding Terraform, Puppet and systemd.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nGet a ready built version of tarmak from [the releases\npage](https://github.com/jetstack/tarmak/releases):\n\n    $ wget https://github.com/jetstack/tarmak/releases/download/0.6.7/tarmak_0.6.7_linux_amd64\n    $ mv tarmak_0.6.7_linux_amd64 tarmak\n    $ chmod +x tarmak\n\nIf you want compile from source, follow the [build\nguide](https://docs.tarmak.io/developer-guide.html#building-tarmak)\ninstead.\n\nNow follow the [user guide](https://docs.tarmak.io/user-guide.html).\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull documentation, including design/architecture overview, user/developer\nguides and more, is maintained at https://docs.tarmak.io/.\n\n----\n\n**Disclaimer** - please note that current releases of Tarmak are *alpha*\n(unless explicitly marked).
