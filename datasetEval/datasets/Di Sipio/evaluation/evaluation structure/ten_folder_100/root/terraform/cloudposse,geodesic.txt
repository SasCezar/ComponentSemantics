It couples best-of-breed technologies with engineering best-practices to equip organizations with the tooling that enables clusters to be spun up in record time without compromising security. \n\nIt\'s works natively with Mac OSX, Linux, and [Windows 10 (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).\n\n\n---\n\nThis project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://cpco.io/sweetops) approach towards DevOps. \n[<img align="right" title="Share via Email" src="https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/ionicons/ios-email-outline-2.0.1-16x16-999999.svg"/>][share_email]\n[<img align="right" title="Share on Google+" src="https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/ionicons/social-googleplus-outline-2.0.1-16x16-999999.svg" />][share_googleplus]\n[<img align="right" title="Share on Facebook" src="https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/ionicons/social-facebook-outline-2.0.1-16x16-999999.svg" />][share_facebook]\n[<img align="right" title="Share on Reddit" src="https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/ionicons/social-reddit-outline-2.0.1-16x16-999999.svg" />][share_reddit]\n[<img align="right" title="Share on LinkedIn" src="https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/ionicons/social-linkedin-outline-2.0.1-16x16-999999.svg" />][share_linkedin]\n[<img align="right" title="Share on Twitter" src="https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/ionicons/social-twitter-outline-2.0.1-16x16-999999.svg" />][share_twitter]\n\n\n\n\nIt\'s 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Screenshots\n\n\n![Demo](https://sweetops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/termtosvg_fmnxoium.svg)\n*<br/>[Example of running a shell](https://github.com/cloudposse/testing.cloudposse.co) based on the `cloudposse/geodesic` base docker image.*\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThese days, the typical software application is distributed as a docker image and run as a container. Why should infrastructure be any different? Since everything we write is "Infrastructure as Code", we believe that it should be treated the same way. This is the "Geodesic Way". Use containers+envs instead of unconventional wrappers, complicated folder structures and symlink hacks. Geodesic is the container for all your infrastructure automation needs that enables you to truly achieve SweetOps.\n\nGeodesic is composed of two parts:\n\n  1. It is an interactive command-line shell. The shell includes the *ultimate* mashup of cloud orchestration tools. Those tools are then integrated to work in concert with each other using a consistent framework. Installation of the shell is as easy as running a docker container.  \n  2. It is a distribution of essential services and [reference architectures](https://github.com/cloudposse?q=cloudposse.co). The distribution includes a collection of [100+ Free Terraform Modules](https://github.com/cloudposse?q=terraform-) and their [invocations](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-root-modules), dozens of preconfigured [Helmfiles](https://github.com/cloudposse/helmfiles), [Helm charts](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts) for CI/CD, VPN, SSH Bastion, Automatic DNS, Automatic TLS, Automatic Monitoring, Account Management, Log Collection, Load Balancing/Routing, Image Serving, and much more. What makes these charts even more valuable is that they were designed from the ground up to work well with each other and integrate with external services for authentication (SSO/OAuth2, MFA).\n\nAn organization may chose to leverage all of these components, or just the parts that make their life easier.\nWe recommend starting by using `geodesic` as a Docker base image (e.g. `FROM cloudposse/geodesic:...` pinned to a release) in your projects.\n\nLet\'s roll...\n\n1. Review our [documentation](https://docs.cloudposse.com/geodesic/)\n2. Check our [reference architectures](https://docs.cloudposse.com/reference-architectures/) to learn how we architect the infrastructure\n3. Use our [coldstart automation](https://github.com/cloudposse/reference-architectures) to get started quickly\n4. Quickly provision [kops clusters](docs/kops.md)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: ABOUT(1) | Geodesic\nauthor:\n- Erik Osterman\ndate: May 2019\n---\n\n## NAME\n\nabout - About the Geodesic Cloud Automation Shell\n\n## FEATURES\n\n* **Secure** - TLS/PKI, OAuth2, MFA Everywhere, remote access VPN, [ultra secure bastion/jumphost](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion) with audit capabilities and slack notifications, [IAM assumed roles](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/), automatic key rotation, encryption at rest, and VPCs\n* **Repeatable** - 100% Infrastructure-as-Code with change automation and support for scriptable admin tasks in any language, including Terraform\n* **Extensible** - A framework where everything can be extended to work the way you want to\n* **Comprehensive** - our [helm charts library](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts) are designed to tightly integrate your cloud-platform with Github Teams and Slack Notifications and CI/CD systems like TravisCI, CircleCI or Jenkins\n* **OpenSource** - Permissive [APACHE 2.0](LICENSE) license means no lock-in and no on-going license fees\n\n## TECHNOLOGIES\n\nAt its core, Geodesic is a framework for provisioning cloud infrastructure and the applications that sit on top of it.

It\'s also a solid structure composed of geometric shapes such as hexagons.\n\n## DESCRIPTION\n\nWe like to think of geodesic as the shortest path to a rock-solid cloud infrastructure. The geodesic logo is a hexagon with a cube suspended at its center. The cube represents this geodesic container, which is central to everything and at the same time is what ties everything together.\n\nBut look a little closer and you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice there\xe2\x80\x99s much more to it. It\'s also an isometric shape of a cube with a missing piece. This represents its pluggable design, which lets anyone extend it to suit their vision.\n\n\n\n## Share the Love \n\nLike this project?
