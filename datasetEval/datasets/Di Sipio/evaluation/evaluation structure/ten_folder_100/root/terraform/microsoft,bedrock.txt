b'# Bedrock\n\n[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/epicstuff/bedrock/_apis/build/status/Microsoft.bedrock?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/epicstuff/bedrock/_build/latest?definitionId=54&branchName=master)\n[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/microsoft/bedrock)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/microsoft/bedrock)\n\nBedrock is automation and tooling for operationalizing production Kubernetes clusters with a [GitOps](./gitops) workflow.  GitOps enables you to build a workflow around your deployments and infrastructure similiar to that of a typical development workflow: pull request based operational changes, point in time auditability into what was deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, and providing nonrepudation about who made those changes.\n\nThis GitOps workflow revolves around [Fabrikate](https://github.com/Microsoft/fabrikate) definitions that enable you to specify your deployments at a higher level of abstraction that separates structure from configuration.  This makes them easier to maintain versus directly specifying them in Kubernetes resource manifest YAML or cobbling together shell scripts to build Kubernetes resource manifests from templating solutions.  Fabrikate definitions also allow you to leverage common pieces across many deployments and to share structure amongst different clusters differentiated only by config.\n\nBedrock also provides [guidance and automation](./gitops/README.md) for building GitOps pipelines with a variety of popular CI/CD orchestrators.\n\nFinally, Bedrock provides a set of Terraform environment templates for deploying your Kubernetes clusters, including automation for setting up the GitOps Operator [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux) in your cluster.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nA Bedrock deployment follows three steps at a high level:\n\n1. [Create and deploy](./cluster/README.md) a GitOps enabled Kubernetes cluster.\n2. Define a [Fabrikate](https://github.com/microsoft/fabrikate) high level deployment definition.\n3. [Setup a GitOps pipeline](./gitops/README.md) to automate deployments of this definition to this cluster based on typical application and cluster lifecycle events.\n\nThe steps required to operationalize a production Kubernetes cluster can be pretty extensive, so we have also put together a [simple walkthrough for deploying a first cluster](./docs/azure-simple/README.md) that makes a great first step.\n\n## Community\n\n[Please join us on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bedrockco/shared_invite/enQtNjIwNzg3NTU0MDgzLWRiYzQxM2ZmZjQ2NGE2YjA2YTJmMjg3ZmJmOTQwOWY0MTU3NDVkNDJkZDUyMDExZjIxNTg5NWY3MTI3MzFiN2U) for discussion and/or questions.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe do not claim to have all the answers and would greatly appreciate your ideas and pull requests.\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
