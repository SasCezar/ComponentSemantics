b"# Terraform: Up & Running Code\n\nThis repo contains the code samples for the book *[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)*,\n2nd edition, by [Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com).\n\n\n\n\n## Quick start\n\nAll the code is in the [code](/code) folder. It is organized by language (terraform, bash, ruby, etc) and within each\nlanguage, by chapter. Since this code comes from a book about Terraform, the vast majority of the code consists of\nTerraform examples in the [code/terraform folder](/code/terraform). \n\nFor instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder, and, of course, the \n*[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* book. \n\n\n\n## More examples\n\nThe example code in *Terraform: Up and Running* are mostly for Amazon Web Services (AWS). There is a project underway\nto translate these examples to their equivalents on other cloud providers, such as Google Cloud and Azure, here:\nhttps://github.com/mjuenema/Terraform-Up-and-Running-Code-Samples-Translated/. \n\n\n\n## Looking for the 1st edition?\n\nAll the code examples in the `master` branch are for the 2nd edition of *Terraform: Up & Running*. If you're looking\nfor the code examples from the 1st edition, please head over to the \n[1st-edition branch](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code/tree/1st-edition).\n\n\n\n## License\n\nThis code is released under the MIT License.
