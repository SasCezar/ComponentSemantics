b"# REST API SDK for PHP\n\n![Home Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/paypal/PayPal-PHP-SDK/images/homepage.jpg)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paypal/PayPal-PHP-SDK.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paypal/PayPal-PHP-SDK)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/paypal/PayPal-PHP-SDK/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/paypal/PayPal-PHP-SDK?branch=master)\n\n__Welcome to PayPal PHP SDK__. This repository contains PayPal's PHP SDK and samples for REST API.\n\n## Direct Credit Card Support\n> **Important: The PayPal REST API no longer supports new direct credit card integrations.**  Please instead consider [Braintree Direct](https://www.braintreepayments.com/products/braintree-direct); which is, PayPal's preferred integration solution for accepting direct credit card payments in your mobile app or website. Braintree, a PayPal service, is the easiest way to accept credit cards, PayPal, and many other payment methods.\n\n## Please Note\n\n> **The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Council has [mandated](https://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls) that early versions of TLS be retired from service.  All organizations that handle credit card information are required to comply with this standard. As part of this obligation, PayPal is updating its services to require TLS 1.2 for all HTTPS connections. At this time, PayPal will also require HTTP/1.1 for all connections. [Click here](https://github.com/paypal/tls-update) for more information**\n\n> **Connections to the sandbox environment use only TLS 1.2.**\n\n## SDK Documentation\n\n[Our PayPal-PHP-SDK Page](http://paypal.github.io/PayPal-PHP-SDK/) includes all the documentation related to PHP SDK.
