b'= Developing Restful APIs: A Comprehensive Set of Guidelines by Zalando\n\nhttps://travis-ci.org/zalando/restful-api-guidelines[image:https://travis-ci.org/zalando/restful-api-guidelines.svg?branch=master[Build Status]]\nLatest published version:\nhttp://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/[*HTML*],\nhttp://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/zalando-guidelines.pdf[*PDF*],\nhttp://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/zalando-guidelines.epub[*EPUB3*]\n\n== Purpose\n\nGreat RESTful APIs look like they were designed by a single team. This\npromotes API adoption, reduces friction, and enables clients to use them\nproperly. To build APIs that meet this standard, and to answer many\ncommon questions encountered along the way of RESTful API development,\nthe Zalando Tech team has created this comprehensive set of guidelines.\nWe have shared it with you to inspire additional discussion and\nrefinement within and among your teams, and contribute our learnings and\nsuggestions to the tech community at large.\n\n== Usage\n\nFeel free to use these guidelines as a guidance for your own\ndevelopment. Note that we encourage our own teams to use them in order\nto challenge their APIs. As such, you should consider this to be a\nliving, evolving document. We will revise and update based on our\nlearnings and experiences.\n\nSee link:BUILD.adoc[BUILD documentation] for technical details.\n\n== License\n\nWe have published these guidelines under the CC-BY (Creative commons\nAttribution 4.0) license.
