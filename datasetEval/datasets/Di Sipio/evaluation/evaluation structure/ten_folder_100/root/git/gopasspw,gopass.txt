With `pass`, each secret lives inside of a `gpg` encrypted file whose filename is the title of the website or resource that requires the secret. These encrypted files may be organized into meaningful folder hierarchies, copied from computer to computer, and, in general, manipulated using standard command line file management utilities. - [passwordstore.org](https://www.passwordstore.org/)\n\n*gopass* is a rewrite of the *pass* password manager in [Go](https://golang.org/) with the aim of making it cross-platform and [adding additional features](#features). Our target audience are professional developers and sysadmins (and especially teams of those) who are well versed with a command line interface. One explicit goal for this project is to make it more approachable to non-technical users. We go by the UNIX philosophy and try to do one thing and do it well, providing a stellar user experience and a sane, simple interface.\n\n## Demo\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/172749.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/172749)\n\n## Features\n\nPlease see [docs/features.md](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass/blob/master/docs/features.md) for an extensive list of all features along with several usage examples.\n\n| **Feature**                 | *pass* | *gopass* | **State** | **Description**                                                   |\n| --------------------------- | ------ | -------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Secure secret storage       | \xe2\x9c\x94      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *stable*  | Securely storing secrets encrypted with GPG                       |\n| Recipient management        | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *beta*    | Easily manage multiple users of each store                        |\n| Multiple stores             | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *beta*    | Mount multiple stores in your root store, like file systems       |\n| password quality assistance | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *beta*    | Checks existing or new passwords for common flaws                 |\n| Binary support              | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *alpha*   | Special handling of binary files (automatic Base64 encoding)      |\n| K/V and YAML support        | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *alpha*   | Special handling for Key/Value and YAML content in secrets        |\n| password leak checker       | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *alpha*   | Perform **offline** checks against known leaked passwords         |\n| PAGER support               | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *stable*  | Automatically invoke a pager on long output                       |\n| JSON API                    | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *stable*   | Allow gopass to be used as a native extension for browser plugins |\n| Automatic fuzzy search      | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *stable*  | Automatically search for matching store entries if a literal entry was not found |\n| gopass sync                 | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *beta*    | Easy to use syncing of remote repos and GPG keys |\n| Desktop Notifications       | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *beta*    | Display desktop notifications and completing long running operations |\n| OTP support                 | (\xe2\x9c\x94)    | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *stable*  | Generate HOTP/TOTP tokens based on the stored secret               |\n| Multiple Crypto Backends    | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *alpha*   | Extensible crypto backend support (GPG, NaCl)                      |\n| Editing Recipients per Secret    | \xe2\x9d\x8c      | \xe2\x9c\x94        | *beta*   | Select recipients per secret when encrypting |\n| Extensions                  | \xe2\x9c\x94      | \xe2\x9d\x8c        |           | Extend gopass with custom commands |\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you have [Go](https://golang.org/) 1.12 (or greater) installed:\n\n```bash\ngo get github.com/gopasspw/gopass\n```\n\nOtherwise, please see [docs/setup.md](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass/blob/master/docs/setup.md).\n\n\n## Upgrade\n\nTo upgrade with Go installed, run:\n```bash\ngo get -u github.com/gopasspw/gopass\n```\n\nOtherwise, use the setup docs mentioned in the installation section to reinstall the latest version.\n\n## Development\n\nThis project uses [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). In other words, create feature branches from master, open an PR against master, and rebase onto master if necessary.\n\nWe aim for compatibility with the [latest stable Go Release](https://golang.org/dl/) only.\n\n## Credit & License\n\ngopass is maintained by the nice folks from [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/gopass) and licensed under the terms of the MIT license.\n\nMaintainers of this repository:\n\n* Christoph Oelm\xc3\xbcller <christoph.oelmueller@justwatch.com> [@zwopir](https://github.com/zwopir)\n* Matthias Loibl <mail@matthiasloibl.com> [@metalmatze](https://github.com/metalmatze)\n* Dominik Schulz <dominik.schulz@gmail.com> [@dominikschulz](https://github.com/dominikschulz)\n\nPlease refer to the Git commit log for a complete list of contributors.\n\n## Community\n\ngopass is developed in the open.
