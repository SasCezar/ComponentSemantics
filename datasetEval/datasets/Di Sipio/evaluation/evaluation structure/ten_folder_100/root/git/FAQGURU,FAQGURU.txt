Many of these questions are real questions from real interviews. It is by no means comprehensive, and the answers are relatively short ( and for each of the concepts, there are probably better and/or more in depth coverage in the web), but this repo like reference tool, that helps you to prepare for technical interview.\n\nNote: Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person\'s capabilities than a straight answer would.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n### Topics\n\n1.
