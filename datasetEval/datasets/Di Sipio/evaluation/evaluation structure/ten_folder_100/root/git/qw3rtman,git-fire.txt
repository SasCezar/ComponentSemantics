b'# `git-fire` :fire:\n\n### ![Inspiration](https://i.imgur.com/3POtveC.jpg)\n\n`git-fire` is a Git plugin that **helps in the event of an emergency** by switching to the repository\'s root directory, adding all current files, committing, and pushing commits and all stashes to a new branch (to prevent merge conflicts).\n\n**Alias it to [`git out`](https://np.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3nc531/in_case_of_fire/cvmxnv1) or [`git going`](https://np.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3nc531/in_case_of_fire/cvmsajb) for comedic effect.**\n\n- `git config --global alias.out fire`\n- `git config --global alias.going fire`\n\n## What It Does\n\n- changes directory to root directory of the repository\n- creates new branch `fire-<current branch>-<user email>-<seconds since epoch>`\n- adds all files\n- commits with `"Fire! Branch <new branch>"` or custom message\n- pushes commits to remote\n- pushes all stashes to remote\n\n## Usage\n\n`git-fire <message>`\n\n`<message>` is optional. If not specified, `"Fire! Branch fire-<current branch>-<user email>-<seconds since epoch>"` will be used.\n\n## Installation\n\nJust copy `git-fire` to your `$PATH` and ensure it is an executable (`chmod +x git-fire`) and you\'re good to go. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\n\n`git-fire` is also available via [`npm`](https://npmjs.com/git-fire). Just run `npm install -g git-fire`, which will copy the `git-fire` binary to your `$PATH`.\n\nAlso make sure you have Git installed.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nYour life is always more valuable than any code. You should leave the building immediately in a true emergency.\n\nCode can be re-written, but humans cannot.\n\n## Credit\n\nOriginally seen on [Hackathon Hackers Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackers) group.\n\n[Original Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3nc531/in_case_of_fire/)\n\n[Image source](https://instagram.com/p/8N8J8wRgPq/) | [Printable Image](http://imgur.com/IiAdxbB) | Artist: [\xc3\x81kos Szokodi](https://github.com/szokodiakos)\n'
