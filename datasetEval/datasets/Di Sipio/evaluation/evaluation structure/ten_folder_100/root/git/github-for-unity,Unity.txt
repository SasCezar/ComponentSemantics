b'# [GitHub for Unity](https://unity.github.com)\n\nThe GitHub for Unity extension brings [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and GitHub into [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), integrating source control into your work with friendly and accessible tools and workflows.\n\nYou can reach the team right here by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/issues/new). You can also tweet at [@GitHubUnity](https://twitter.com/GitHubUnity)\n\n[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/github-for-unity/Unity?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/github-windows/unity)\n\n## Notices\n\nPlease refer to the [list of known issues](https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug), and make sure you have backups of your work before trying it out.\n\nFrom version 0.19 onwards, the location of the plugin has moved to `Assets/Plugins/GitHub`. If you have version 0.18 or lower, you need to delete the `Assets/Editor/GitHub` folder before you install newer versions. You should exit Unity and delete the folder from Explorer/Finder, as Unity will not unload native libraries while it\'s running. Also, remember to update your `.gitignore` file.\n\n## Building and Contributing\n\nPlease read the [How to Build](docs/contributing/how-to-build.md) document for information on how to build GitHub for Unity.\n\nThe [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document will help you get setup and familiar with the source. The [documentation](docs/) folder also contains more resources relevant to the project.\n\nIf you\'re looking for something to work on, check out the [up-for-grabs](https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aup-for-grabs) label.\n\n## How to use\n\nThe [quick guide to GitHub for Unity](docs/using/quick-guide.md)\n\nMore [in-depth information](docs/readme.md)\n\n## License\n\n**[MIT](LICENSE)**\n\nThe MIT license grant is not for GitHub\'s trademarks, which include the logo\ndesigns.
