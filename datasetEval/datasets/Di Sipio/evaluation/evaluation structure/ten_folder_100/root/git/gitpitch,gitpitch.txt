It automatically turns any\nREADME.md file found within a Git repository into nicely rendered documentation.\nThis convention gives developers a simple and convenient way to document any\nproject.\n\n#### The PITCHME.md Convention\n\nGitPitch introduces a brand new convention for all Git users, the PITCHME.md\nconvention. This convention automatically turns any PITCHME.md file found\nwithin a Git repository into a modern slideshow presentation on\n[gitpitch.com](https://gitpitch.com). This convention gives developers a simple\nand convenient way to promote, pitch or present absolutely anything. Using the\ntools we already know and love - Markdown and Git.\n\n<br><br>\n\n### The GitPitch Backstory\n\nGitPitch began as a personal project back in 2016. The early versions of the\nservice were maintained as an open source project in this repository. I now\nwork on this project full-time and develop a wide range of\n[free, subscriber, and enterprise](https://gitpitch.com/pricing) slide deck\nsolutions. You can still fork, clone, or modify the original source and open\nnew issues and feature requests on this repo. For project news and updates,\nfollow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitpitch).\n\nIf you like this project please show your support with a\n[GitHub Star](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/stargazers). Your support is\nmuch appreciated. Cheers, David :heart:.\n\n<br><br>\n'
