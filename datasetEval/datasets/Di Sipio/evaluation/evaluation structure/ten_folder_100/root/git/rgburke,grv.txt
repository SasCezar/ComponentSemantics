b'# GRV - Git Repository Viewer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rgburke/grv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rgburke/grv)\n\nGRV is a terminal based interface for viewing Git repositories. It allows\nrefs, commits and diffs to be viewed, searched and filtered. The behaviour\nand style can be customised through configuration. A query language can\nbe used to filter refs and commits, see the [Documentation](#documentation)\nsection for more information.\n\n![Screenshot](./doc/grv-history-view.png)\n\nMore screenshots can be seen [here](doc/screenshots.md)\n\n## Features\n\n - Commits and refs can be filtered using a query language.\n - Changes to the repository are captured by monitoring the filesystem allowing the UI to be updated automatically.\n - Organised as tabs and splits. Custom tabs and splits can be created using any combination of views.\n - Vi like keybindings by default, key bindings can be customised.\n - Custom themes can be created.\n - Mouse support.\n - Commit Graph.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for GRV is available [here](doc/documentation.md)\n\n## Install\n\n**Note:** `grv` is currently an alias used by oh-my-zsh. Add `unalias grv` to the end of your `.zshrc` to invoke GRV.\n\n### Linux\n\nStatic binaries are available for Linux. For example, to use\nthe amd64 binary run the following steps:\n\n```\nwget -O grv https://github.com/rgburke/grv/releases/download/v0.3.2/grv_v0.3.2_linux64\nchmod +x ./grv\n./grv -repoFilePath /path/to/repo\n```\n\n### Mac\n\nGRV is available in homebrew and can be installed with:\n\n```\nbrew install grv\n```\n\n### FreeBSD\n\nGRV can be installed as a binary package\n\n```\npkg install grv\n```\n\nor from ports\n\n```\ncd /usr/ports/devel/grv && make install clean\n```\n\n## Build instructions\n\nGo version 1.8 or later is required. GRV depends on the following libraries:\n\n - libncursesw\n - libreadline\n - libcurl\n - cmake (to build libgit2)\n\nBuilding GRV on OSX requires homebrew, and for `readline`, `pkg-config`, and `cmake` to be installed using homebrew:\n\n```\nbrew install readline pkg-config cmake\n```\n\nTo install GRV run:\n\n```\ngo get -d github.com/rgburke/grv/cmd/grv\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/rgburke/grv\nmake install\n```\n\nTo install grv with an alternative binary name change the last step to:\n\n```\nmake install BINARY=NewBinaryName\n```\n\nwhere `NewBinaryName` is the alternative name to use instead.\n\nThe steps above will install GRV to `$GOPATH/bin`. A static libgit2 will be built and\nincluded in GRV when built this way. Alternatively if libgit2 version 0.27 is\ninstalled on your system GRV can be built normally:\n\n```\ngo install ./cmd/grv\n```\n'
