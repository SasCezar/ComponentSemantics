b'Gitless\n=======\n\n[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/gitless.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/gitless "PyPI version")\n[![Homebrew Formula](https://img.shields.io/homebrew/v/gitless.svg)](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gitless "Homebrew Formula")\n\n[![Travis Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/sdg-mit/gitless/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sdg-mit/gitless "Travis Build Status")\n[![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/sdg-mit/gitless?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/spderosso/gitless "AppVeyor Build Status")\n\n[Gitless](http://gitless.com "Gitless\'s website") is an experimental version\ncontrol system built on top of Git. Many\npeople complain that Git is hard to use. We think the problem lies deeper than\nthe user interface, in the concepts underlying Git. Gitless is an experiment to\nsee what happens if you put a simple veneer on an app that changes the\nunderlying concepts. Because Gitless is implemented on top of Git (could be\nconsidered what Git pros call a "porcelain" of Git), you can always fall\nback on Git. And of course your coworkers you share a repository with need never\nknow that you\'re not a Git aficionado.\n\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nNote that the installation **won\'t interfere** with your Git installation in any\nway, you can keep using Git, and switch between Git and Gitless seamlessly.\n\nWe currently require Git (1.7.12+) to be installed (but this requirement is\ngoing to disappear soon once we finish with our migration to [pygit2](https://github.com/libgit2/pygit2)).\n\n\n### Binary release (macOS and Linux only)\n\nBinary releases for macOS and Linux are available from the\n[Gitless website](http://gitless.com "Gitless\'s website").\n\nIf you\'ve downloaded a binary release of Gitless everything is contained in the\ngl binary, so to install simply do:\n\n    $ cp path-to-downloaded-gl-binary /usr/local/bin/gl\n\nYou can put the binary in other locations as well, just be sure to update your\n`PATH`.\n\nIf for some reason this doesn\'t work (maybe you are running an old version of\nyour OS?), try one of the other options (installing from source or via\nthe Python Package Index).\n\n### Installing from source\n\nTo install from source you need to have Python (2.7, 3.2+ or PyPy)\ninstalled.\n\nNote to Windows users: Python 3 is not supported yet,\nsee [#146](https://github.com/sdg-mit/gitless/issues/146) for more info.\n\nAdditionally, you need to [install pygit2](\nhttp://www.pygit2.org/install.html "pygit2 install").\n\nThen, [download the source code tarball](http://gitless.com "Gitless\'s website")\nand do:\n\n    $ ./setup.py install\n\n\n### Installing via the Python Package Index\n\nIf you are a Python fan you might find it easier to install\nGitless via the Python Package Index. To do this, you need to have\nPython (2.7, 3.2+ or PyPy) installed.\n\nNote to Windows users: Python 3 is not supported yet,\nsee [#146](https://github.com/sdg-mit/gitless/issues/146) for more info.\n\nAdditionally, you need to [install pygit2](\nhttp://www.pygit2.org/install.html "pygit2 install").\n\nThen, just do:\n\n    $ pip install gitless\n\n### Installing via Homebrew (macOS only)\n\nIf you are using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/ "Homebrew homepage"), a package\nmanager for macOS, you can install Gitless with:\n\n```\nbrew update\nbrew install gitless\n```\n\n### Installing via Snapcraft (Linux only)\n\nIf you are using [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/ "Snapcraft"), a\npackage manager for Linux, you can install the most recent release\nof Gitless with:\n\n```\nsnap install --channel=beta gitless\n```\n\nYou can also use the `edge` channel to install the most recent build.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n`gl -h`, `gl subcmd -h` or check\n[our documentation](http://gitless.com "Gitless\'s website")\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\nIf you find a bug, you can help us by submitting an issue to our\nGitHub Repository. If you\'d like to contribute\ncode, here are some useful things to know:\n\n- To install gitless for development, [install pygit2](\n  http://www.pygit2.org/install.html "pygit2 install"), clone the repo,\n  `cd` to the repo root and do `./setup.py develop`. This will install\n  the `gl` command with a symlink to your source files. You can make\n  changes to your code and run `gl` to test them.\n- We follow (to some extent) the [Google Python Style Guide](\n    https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html\n    "Google Python Style Guide").\nBefore submitting code, take a few seconds to look at the style guide and the\nGitless\'s code so that your edits are consistent with the codebase\n\n- Finally, if you don\'t want [Travis](\n    https://travis-ci.org/sdg-mit/gitless "Travis") to\nbe mad at you, check that tests pass in Python 2.7 and 3.2+. Tests can be run with:\n  ```\n  pip install nose\n  nosetests # run tests other than end-to-end tests\n  nosetests ./gitless/tests/test_e2e.py # run end-to-end tests\n  ```\n'
