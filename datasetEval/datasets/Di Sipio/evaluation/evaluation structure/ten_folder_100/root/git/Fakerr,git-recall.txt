b'# git-recall\n\n> Simple and handy tool to easily recall what you\'ve done\n\n![git recall](http://imgur.com/zuw2LqW.gif)\n\n## Purpose\n\n`git-recall` is a simple tool that allows you to easily go through your commits and\ncheck what you or other contributors in your team did. It doesn\'t aim to be a replacement for the\n`git log` command, but just to be a convenient way to recall what you\'ve done from your terminal.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh\n$ git recall   [-a <author name>]\n               [-d <days-ago>]\n               [-b <branch name>]\n               [-p <paths>]\n               [-f]\n               [-h]\n               [-v]\n```\n\n##### Options description:\n\n- `-a`      - Restrict search for a specific user (use -a "all" for all users)\n- `-d`      - Display commits for the last n days\n- `-b`      - Specify branch to display commits from\n- `-p`      - Specify path/s or file/s to display commits from\n- `-f`      - Fetch the latest changes\n- `-h`      - Show help screen\n- `-v`      - Show version\n\n##### How to use:\n\nOnce the commits are displayed, you can use either the `arrow keys` or `j/k` to switch between commits,\npress `TAB` or `e` to `expand/reduce` the commit\'s diff or `q` to quit.\n\n##### Limitations:\n\nwhen the number of lines between the commits list and a commit\'s diff is higher than the current terminal session\'s number of lines,\nthe result will be displayed using the [`less`](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/less.htm) program which will open the diff in a separate screen.\nYou can still use either `TAB` or `q` to return to the commits list.\n\n## Examples\n\n```sh\n$ git recall\n# By default (without options), the command will display commits from yesterday and\n# for the current user.\n```\n\n\n```sh\n$ git recall -d 5 -a "Doge"\n# The command will show all Doge\'s commits from 5 days ago.\n\n$ git recall -d 5 -a "all"\n# The command will show commits of all contributors from 5 days ago.\n```\n\n\n```sh\n$ git recall -f\n# Fetch commits beforehand.\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n##### Without using tools\n\nYou can install it by simply copying the `git-recall` script into any existing path\n(e.g. `/usr/local/bin`) or create your own directory and add it to the `PATH` variable.\n\nMake sure to run `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/git-recall` or the directory in which you copied it to. \n\n##### Using NPM\nUse `npm` to install the project.\n\n```sh\nnpm install --global git-recall\n```\n##### Manual install\nClone the project and install it using make install.\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/Fakerr/git-recall.git\n$ cd git-recall\n$ sudo make install\n```\n## Requirements\n- OS: Linux or OSX\n- Bash 4.3 or more\n- Tools: git, less, sed\n\n##### Optional Requirements\n- For a better UX, it\'s recommended to have installed the `lesskey` program.\n\n## Contribution\nPull requests are welcome, along with any feedback or ideas.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n'
