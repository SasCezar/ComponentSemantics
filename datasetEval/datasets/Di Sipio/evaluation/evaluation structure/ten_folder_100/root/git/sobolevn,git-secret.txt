You can also use `make` if you want to.\nSee the [installation section](http://git-secret.io/installation) for the details.\n\n### Requirements\n\n`git-secret` relies on several external packages:\n\n- `bash` since `3.2.57` (it is hard to tell the correct `patch` release)\n- `gawk` since `4.0.2`\n- `git` since `1.8.3.1`\n- `gpg` since `gnupg 1.4` to `gnupg 2.X`\n- `sha256sum` since `8.21` (on freebsd and MacOS `shasum` is used instead)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nDo you want to help the project? Find an [issue](https://github.com/sobolevn/git-secret/issues)\nand send a PR. It is more than welcomed! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to do that.\n\n### Security\n\nIn order to encrypt (git-secret hide -m) files only when modified, the path\nmappings file tracks sha256sum checksums of the files added (git-secret add) to\ngit-secret\'s path mappings filesystem database. Although, the chances of\nencountering a sha collision are low, it is recommend that you pad files with\nrandom data for greater security. Or avoid using  the `-m` option altogether.\nIf your secret file holds more data than just a single password these\nprecautions should not be necessary, but could be followed for greater\nsecurity.\n\nIf you found any security related issues, please do not disclose it in public. Send an email to `security@wemake.services`\n\n\n## Changelog\n\n`git-secret` uses [semver](https://semver.org/). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).\n\n\n## Packagers\n\nThanks also to all the people and groups who package git-secret to be easier to install on particular OSes or distributions!\n\nHere are some packagings of git-secret that we\'re aware of:\n\n- https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/git-secret\n- https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/git-secret\n- https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/git-secret\n- https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-secret/\n- https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/testing/x86/git-secret\n- https://packages.debian.org/sid/git-secret\n- https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/git-secret/template\n\nSuch packages are considered \'downstream\' because the git-secret code \'flows\' from the git-secret repository\nto the various rpm/deb/dpkg/etc packages that are created for specific OSes and distributions.\n\nWe have also added notes specifically for packagers in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\n## Sponsors\n\nSupport this project by becoming a sponsor.
