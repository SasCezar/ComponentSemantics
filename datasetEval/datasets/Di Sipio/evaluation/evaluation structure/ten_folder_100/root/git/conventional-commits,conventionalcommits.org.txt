b"# ConventionalCommits.org\n\n[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-yellow.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)\n\nThis repo is the home of the Conventional Commits specification.\n\n## Repo Layout\n\nWe use [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) as static site generator, so we use the [directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/) HUGO proposes.\n\n#### Our implementation\n\n* `./content`: contains all the versions of the specification.\n* `./content/next/`: contains the version of the specification (where all the changes SHOULD be made).\n* `./content/**/index[.lang].md`: contains the content of the specification, if a language is specified it's a translation.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe'd love your help refining the language of this specification,\nfixing typos, or adding more translations. Please don't hesitate\nto send a pull request.\n\n### Adding a translation\n\n1. Create a new file in `./content/version/index.{lang}.md` using the hugo command `hugo new {version}/index.{lang}.md`.\n1. Ensure all files have the appropriate fields required (see others as an example)..\n1. Add the language to the `config.yaml` file (see others as an example).\n\n### Running project locally\n\nThere's a docker-compose.yml file ready that will help you to check if the website looks good!\nTo run it make sure you have [docker-compose installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) on your machine and just use the command `docker-compose up` to make it run locally.\n\nOnce the website will be compiled, you can see the website visiting `http://localhost:1313`\n\n## Badges!\n\nTell your users that you use the Conventional Commits specification:\n\n```markdown\n[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-yellow.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)\n```\n\n## Thank you\n\nTo ***[Lorenzo D'Ianni](https://github.com/lorenzodianni)*** for the great effort creating the CSS and the HTML for the new UI.\n\nTo [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host our project, giving us a lot of [amazing built in functionality](https://www.netlify.com/features/) for free.\n\nTo `semver.org`: we used [semver.org](https://github.com/mojombo/semver.org) as a blueprint for\nthe structure of this specification and the first version of the website.\n"
