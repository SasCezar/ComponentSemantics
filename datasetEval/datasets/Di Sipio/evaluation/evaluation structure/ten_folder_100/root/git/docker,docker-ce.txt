b'# Docker CE\n\nThis repository hosts open source components of Docker CE products. The\n`master` branch serves to unify the upstream components on a regular\nbasis. Long-lived release branches host the code that goes into a product\nversion for the lifetime of the product.\n\nThis repository is solely maintained by Docker, Inc.\n\n## Issues\n\nThere are separate issue-tracking repos for the end user Docker CE\nproducts specialized for a platform. Find your issue or file a new issue\nfor the platform you are using:\n\n* https://github.com/docker/for-linux\n* https://github.com/docker/for-mac\n* https://github.com/docker/for-win\n* https://github.com/docker/for-aws\n* https://github.com/docker/for-azure\n\n## Unifying upstream sources\n\nThe `master` branch is a combination of components adapted from\ndifferent upstream git repos into a unified directory structure using the\n[moby-components](https://github.com/shykes/moby-extras/blob/master/cmd/moby-components)\ntool.\n\nYou can view the upstream git repos in the\n[components.conf](components.conf) file. Each component is isolated into\nits own directory under the [components](components) directory.\n\nThe tool will import each component git history within the appropriate path.\n\nFor example, this shows a commit\nis imported into the component `engine` from\n[moby/moby@a27b4b8](https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/a27b4b8cb8e838d03a99b6d2b30f76bdaf2f9e5d)\ninto the `components/engine` directory.\n\n```\ncommit 5c70746915d4589a692cbe50a43cf619ed0b7152\nAuthor: Andrea Luzzardi <aluzzardi@gmail.com>\nDate:   Sat Jan 19 00:13:39 2013\n\n    Initial commit\n    Upstream-commit: a27b4b8cb8e838d03a99b6d2b30f76bdaf2f9e5d\n    Component: engine\n\n components/engine/container.go       | 203 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/container_test.go  | 186 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/docker.go          | 112 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/docker_test.go     | 175 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/filesystem.go      |  52 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/filesystem_test.go |  35 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n components/engine/lxc_template.go    |  94 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/state.go           |  48 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/utils.go           | 115 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/utils_test.go      | 126 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n 10 files changed, 1146 insertions(+)\n```\n\n## Updates to `master` branch\n\nMain development of new features should be directed towards the upstream\ngit repos. The `master` branch of this repo will periodically pull in new\nchanges from upstream to provide a point for integration.\n\n## Branching for release\n\nWhen a release is started for Docker CE, a new branch will be created\nfrom `master`. Branch names will be `YY.MM` to represent the time-based\nrelease version of the product, e.g. `17.06`.\n\n## Adding fixes to release branch\n\nNote: every commit of a fix should affect files only within one component\ndirectory.\n\n### Fix available upstream\n\nA PR cherry-picking the necessary commits should be created against\nthe release branch. If the the cherry-pick cannot be applied cleanly,\nthe logic of the fix should be ported manually.\n\n### No fix yet\n\nFirst create the PR with the fix for the release branch. Once the fix has\nbeen merged, be sure to port the fix to the respective upstream git repo.\n\n## Release tags\n\nThere will be a git tag for each release candidate (RC) and general\navailability (GA) release. The tag will only point to commits on release\nbranches.\n'
