One of the biggest features of the development of the front-end is that it changes quickly, and sometimes it has to deal with changes in various demand scenarios, and has to develop many versions or modifications to the interface. Various businesses rely on a strong underlying data platform to grow rapidly, and how to efficiently provide data support for various services is a concern for everyone. Moreover, the front-end solution is to componentize the view. Each line of business can be either the user of the component or the producer of the component. If the common content can be extracted and provided to each business party for repeated use, it will be able to Save valuable development time and development manpower. Then the problem comes. The front-end implements cross-business reuse through components. How does the back-end interface improve development efficiency accordingly? GraphQL, it is a new way to deal with complex scenes.\n\nOfficial explanation:\n\n>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.\n\nHere are some of the benefits of GraphQL:\n\n* Ask for what you need, get exactly that\n\n* Get many resources in a single request\n\n* Describe what\xe2\x80\x99s possible with a type system\n\n* Move faster with powerful developer tools\n\n* API evolution does not require a version\n\n\nThis article will be used with koa to implement a GraphQL query example, gradually from the simple kao service to mongodb data insertion query to the use of GraphQL,\nLet everyone quickly see:\n\n* Build a koa to build a backstage project\n* Simple routing method\n* Simple operation mongodb with mongoose\n* Getting started with GraphQL\n\nThe project is shown below\n\n1\xe3\x80\x81Build GraphQL tool query interface\xe3\x80\x82\n\n![](https://user-gold-cdn.xitu.io/2018/1/2/160b58e712e0db1a?w=1173&h=855&f=gif&s=1376761)\n\n2\xe3\x80\x81The front end uses jq to send ajax usage\n\n\n![](https://user-gold-cdn.xitu.io/2018/1/2/160b5927554c21cc?w=962&h=716&f=gif&s=2278918)\n\n\n## install \n\n````\ngit clone https://github.com/naihe138/GraphQL-demo.git\n\nnpm install \n\nnode start\n\n````\n'
