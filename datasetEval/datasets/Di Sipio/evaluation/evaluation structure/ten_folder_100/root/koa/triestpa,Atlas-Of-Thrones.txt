b'# Atlas-Of-Thrones\n\nAn interactive "Game of Thrones" map powered by Leaflet, PostGIS, and Redis.\n\nVisit https://atlasofthrones.com/ to explore the application.\n\nVisit http://blog.patricktriest.com/game-of-thrones-map-node-postgres-redis/ for a tutorial on building the backend, using Node.js, PostGIS, and Redis.\n\nVisit https://blog.patricktriest.com/game-of-thrones-leaflet-webpack/ for part II of the tutorial, which provides a detailed guide to building the frontend webapp using Webpack, Leaflet, and framework-less Javascript components.\n\n![](https://cdn.patricktriest.com/blog/images/posts/got_map/got_map.jpg)\n\n#### Structure\n- `app/` - The front-end web application source.\n- `public/` - The compiled and minified front-end code.\n- `server/` - The Node.js API server code.\n- `data_augmentation/` - A collection of scripts to augment the shapefile data with summary data scraped from various wikis.\n- `geojson_preview` - A simple html page to preview geojson data on a map.\n\n#### Setup\n\nTo setup the project, simply download or clone the project to your local machine and `npm install`.\n\nYou can find a SQL database dump here with all of the content pre-loaded and ready to be queried - https://cdn.patricktriest.com/atlas-of-thrones/atlas_of_thrones.sql\n\nThe only extra step is adding a `.env` file in order to properly initialize the required environment variables.\n\nHere\'s an example `.env` file with sensible defaults for local development -\n```\nPORT=5000\nDATABASE_URL=postgres://patrick@localhost:5432/atlas_of_thrones?ssl=false\nREDIS_HOST=localhost\nREDIS_PORT=6379\nCORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080\n```\n\nYou\'ll need to change the username in the DATABASE_URL entry to match your PostgreSQL user credentials. Unless your name is "Patrick", that is, in which case it might already be fine.\n\nRun `npm run dev` to start the API server on `localhost:5000`, and to build/watch/serve the frontend code from `localhost:8080`.\n\n___\n\n\nThis app is 100% open-source, feel free to utilize the code however you would like.\n\n```\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2018 Patrick Triest\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
