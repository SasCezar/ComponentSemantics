PRAW aims to be easy to use and\ninternally follows all of `Reddit\'s API rules\n<https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API>`_. With PRAW there\'s no need to\nintroduce ``sleep`` calls in your code. Give your client an appropriate user\nagent and you\'re set.\n\n.. _installation:\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPRAW is supported on Python 3.5+. The recommended way to\ninstall PRAW is via `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   pip install praw\n\nTo install the latest development version of PRAW run the following instead:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   pip install --upgrade https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/archive/master.zip\n\nFor instructions on installing Python and pip see "The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to\nPython" `Installation Guides\n<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`_.\n\nQuickstart\n----------\n\nAssuming you already have a credentials for a script-type OAuth application you\ncan instantiate an instance of PRAW like so:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  import praw\n  reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id=\'CLIENT_ID\', client_secret="CLIENT_SECRET",\n                       password=\'PASSWORD\', user_agent=\'USERAGENT\',\n                       username=\'USERNAME\')\n\nWith the ``reddit`` instance you can then interact with Reddit:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  # Create a submission to r/test\n  reddit.subreddit(\'test\').submit(\'Test Submission\', url=\'https://reddit.com\')\n\n  # Comment on a known submission\n  submission = reddit.submission(url=\'https://www.reddit.com/comments/5e1az9\')\n  submission.reply(\'Super rad!\')\n\n  # Reply to the first comment of a weekly top thread of a moderated community\n  submission = next(reddit.subreddit(\'mod\').top(\'week\'))\n  submission.comments[0].reply(\'An automated reply\')\n\n  # Output score for the first 256 items on the frontpage\n  for submission in reddit.front.hot(limit=256):\n      print(submission.score)\n\n  # Obtain the moderator listing for r/redditdev\n  for moderator in reddit.subreddit(\'redditdev\').moderator:\n      print(moderator)\n\nPlease see PRAW\'s `documentation <http://praw.readthedocs.io/>`_ for\nmore examples of what you can do with PRAW.\n\nPRAW Discussion and Support\n---------------------------\n\nFor those new to Python, or would otherwise consider themselves a Python\nbeginner, please consider asking questions on the `r/learnpython\n<https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython>`_ subreddit.
