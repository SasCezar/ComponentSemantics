b'# JSONPlaceholder\n\n[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) is a simple fake REST API for testing and prototyping.\n\nIt\'s like an [image placeholder](http://placehold.it/) but for web developers.\n\nJSONPlaceholder is powered by [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).\n\n<a href="https://www.patreon.com/typicode">\n  <img src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button@2x.png" width="160">\n</a>\n\n## Why?\n\nMost of the time when trying a new library, hacking a prototype or following a tutorial, I found myself in need of some data.\n\nI didn\'t like the idea of using some public API because I had the feeling that I was spending more time registering a client and understanding a complex API than focusing on my task.\n\nBut I liked the idea of image placeholders for web designers. So I decided to code a little Express server inspired by that and here is JSONPlaceholder.\n\nYou can find it running here and are free to use it in your developments: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com. \n\nI hope you will find it useful.\n\n## Features\n\n* No registration\n* Zero-config\n* Basic API\n* "Has many" relationships\n* Filters and nested resources\n* Cross-domain ([CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) and [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP))\n* Supports GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS verbs\n* HTTP or HTTPS\n* Compatible with React, Angular, Vue, Ember, ...\n\n## Guide\n\nFor examples and more, you can visit https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\n'
