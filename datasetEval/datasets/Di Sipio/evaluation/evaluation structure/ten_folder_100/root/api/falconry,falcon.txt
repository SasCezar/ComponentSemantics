I hacked together a quick test for a\ntiny server of mine and was ~40% faster with only 20 minutes of\nwork."\n\n"Falcon is rock solid and it\'s fast."\n\n"I\'m loving #falconframework! Super clean and simple, I finally\nhave the speed and flexibility I need!"\n\n"I feel like I\'m just talking HTTP at last, with nothing in the\nmiddle. Falcon seems like the requests of backend."\n\n"The source code for Falcon is so good, I almost prefer it to\ndocumentation. It basically can\'t be wrong."\n\n"What other framework has integrated support for 786 TRY IT NOW ?"\n\nHow is Falcon Different?\n------------------------\n\n    Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything\n    to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.\n\n    *- Antoine de Saint-Exup\xc3\xa9ry*\n\nWe designed Falcon to support the demanding needs of large-scale\nmicroservices and responsive app backends. Falcon complements more\ngeneral Python web frameworks by providing bare-metal performance,\nreliability, and flexibility wherever you need it.\n\n**Fast.** Same hardware, more requests. Falcon turns around\nrequests several times faster than most other Python frameworks. For\nan extra speed boost, Falcon compiles itself with Cython when\navailable, and also works well with `PyPy <https://pypy.org>`__.\nConsidering a move to another programming language? Benchmark with\nFalcon + PyPy first.\n\n**Reliable.** We go to great lengths to avoid introducing\nbreaking changes, and when we do they are fully documented and only\nintroduced (in the spirit of\n`SemVer <http://semver.org/>`__) with a major version\nincrement. The code is rigorously tested with numerous inputs and we\nrequire 100% coverage at all times. Falcon does not depend on any\nexternal Python packages.\n\n**Flexible.** Falcon leaves a lot of decisions and implementation\ndetails to you, the API developer. This gives you a lot of freedom to\ncustomize and tune your implementation. Due to Falcon\'s minimalist\ndesign, Python community members are free to independently innovate on\n`Falcon add-ons and complementary packages <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki>`__.\n\n**Debuggable.** Falcon eschews magic. It\'s easy to tell which inputs\nlead to which outputs. Unhandled exceptions are never encapsulated or\nmasked. Potentially surprising behaviors, such as automatic request body\nparsing, are well-documented and disabled by default. Finally, when it\ncomes to the framework itself, we take care to keep logic paths simple\nand understandable. All this makes it easier to reason about the code\nand to debug edge cases in large-scale deployments.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n-  Highly-optimized, extensible code base\n-  Intuitive routing via URI templates and REST-inspired resource\n   classes\n-  Easy access to headers and bodies through request and response\n   classes\n-  DRY request processing via middleware components and hooks\n-  Idiomatic HTTP error responses\n-  Straightforward exception handling\n-  Snappy unit testing through WSGI helpers and mocks\n-  CPython 3.5+ and PyPy 3.5+ support\n-  ~20% speed boost under CPython when Cython is available\n\nWho\'s Using Falcon?\n-------------------\n\nFalcon is used around the world by a growing number of organizations,\nincluding:\n\n- 7ideas\n- Cronitor\n- EMC\n- Hurricane Electric\n- Leadpages\n- OpenStack\n- Rackspace\n- Shiftgig\n- tempfil.es\n- Opera Software\n\nIf you are using the Falcon framework for a community or commercial\nproject, please consider adding your information to our wiki under\n`Who\'s Using Falcon? <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki/Who\'s-using-Falcon%3F>`_\n\nCommunity\n---------\n\nA number of Falcon add-ons, templates, and complementary packages are\navailable for use in your projects. We\'ve listed several of these on the\n`Falcon wiki <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki>`_ as a starting\npoint, but you may also wish to search PyPI for additional resources.\n\nThe Falconry community on Gitter is a great place to ask questions and\nshare your ideas. You can find us in `falconry/user\n<https://gitter.im/falconry/user>`_. We also have a\n`falconry/dev <https://gitter.im/falconry/dev>`_ room for discussing\nthe design and development of the framework itself.\n\nPer our\n`Code of Conduct <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/blob/master/CODEOFCONDUCT.md>`_,\nwe expect everyone who participates in community discussions to act\nprofessionally, and lead by example in encouraging constructive\ndiscussions. Each individual in the community is responsible for\ncreating a positive, constructive, and productive culture.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPyPy\n^^^^\n\n`PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`__ is the fastest way to run your Falcon app.\nPyPy3.5+ is supported as of PyPy v5.10.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install falcon\n\nOr, to install the latest beta or release candidate, if any:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install --pre falcon\n\nCPython\n^^^^^^^\n\nFalcon also fully supports\n`CPython <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ 3.5+.\n\nA universal wheel is available on PyPI for the the Falcon framework.\nInstalling it is as simple as:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install falcon\n\nInstalling the Falcon wheel is a great way to get up and running\nquickly in a development environment, but for an extra speed boost when\ndeploying your application in production, Falcon can compile itself with\nCython.\n\nThe following commands tell pip to install Cython, and then to invoke\nFalcon\'s ``setup.py``, which will in turn detect the presence of Cython\nand then compile (AKA cythonize) the Falcon framework with the system\'s\ndefault C compiler.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install cython\n    $ pip install --no-binary :all: falcon\n\nIf you want to verify that Cython is being invoked, simply\npass `-v` to pip in order to echo the compilation commands:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install -v --no-binary :all: falcon\n\n**Installing on OS X**\n\nXcode Command Line Tools are required to compile Cython. Install them\nwith this command:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ xcode-select --install\n\nThe Clang compiler treats unrecognized command-line options as\nerrors, for example:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    clang: error: unknown argument: \'-mno-fused-madd\' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]\n\nYou might also see warnings about unused functions. You can work around\nthese issues by setting additional Clang C compiler flags as follows:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ export CFLAGS="-Qunused-arguments -Wno-unused-function"\n\nDependencies\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFalcon does not require the installation of any other packages, although if\nCython has been installed into the environment, it will be used to optimize\nthe framework as explained above.\n\nWSGI Server\n-----------\n\nFalcon speaks WSGI, and so in order to serve a Falcon app, you will\nneed a WSGI server. Gunicorn and uWSGI are some of the more popular\nones out there, but anything that can load a WSGI app will do.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install [gunicorn|uwsgi]\n\nSource Code\n-----------\n\nFalcon `lives on GitHub <https://github.com/falconry/falcon>`_, making the\ncode easy to browse, download, fork, etc. Pull requests are always welcome! Also,\nplease remember to star the project if it makes you happy. :)\n\nOnce you have cloned the repo or downloaded a tarball from GitHub, you\ncan install Falcon like this:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cd falcon\n    $ pip install .\n\nOr, if you want to edit the code, first fork the main repo, clone the fork\nto your desktop, and then run the following to install it using symbolic\nlinking, so that when you change your code, the changes will be automagically\navailable to your app without having to reinstall the package:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cd falcon\n    $ pip install --no-use-pep517 -e .\n\nYou can manually test changes to the Falcon framework by switching to the\ndirectory of the cloned repo and then running pytest:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cd falcon\n    $ pip install -r requirements/tests\n    $ pytest tests\n\nOr, to run the default set of tests:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install tox && tox\n\nSee also the `tox.ini <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/blob/master/tox.ini>`_\nfile for a full list of available environments.\n\nRead the docs\n-------------\n\nThe docstrings in the Falcon code base are quite extensive, and we\nrecommend keeping a REPL running while learning the framework so that\nyou can query the various modules and classes as you have questions.\n\nOnline docs are available at: https://falcon.readthedocs.io\n\nYou can build the same docs locally as follows:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install tox && tox -e docs\n\nOnce the docs have been built, you can view them by opening the following\nindex page in your browser. On OS X it\'s as simple as::\n\n    $ open docs/_build/html/index.html\n\nOr on Linux:\n\n    $ xdg-open docs/_build/html/index.html\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nHere is a simple, contrived example showing how to create a Falcon-based\nAPI.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # examples/things.py\n\n    # Let\'s get this party started!\n    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server\n\n    import falcon\n\n\n    # Falcon follows the REST architectural style, meaning (among\n    # other things) that you think in terms of resources and state\n    # transitions, which map to HTTP verbs.\n    class ThingsResource:\n        def on_get(self, req, resp):\n            """Handles GET requests"""\n            resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200  # This is the default status\n            resp.body = (\'\\nTwo things awe me most, the starry sky \'\n                         \'above me and the moral law within me.\\n\'\n                         \'\\n\'\n                         \'    ~ Immanuel Kant\\n\\n\')\n\n\n    # falcon.API instances are callable WSGI apps\n    # in larger applications the app is created in a separate file\n    app = falcon.API()\n\n    # Resources are represented by long-lived class instances\n    things = ThingsResource()\n\n    # things will handle all requests to the \'/things\' URL path\n    app.add_route(\'/things\', things)\n\n    if __name__ == \'__main__\':\n        with make_server(\'\', 8000, app) as httpd:\n            print(\'Serving on port 8000...\')\n\n            # Serve until process is killed\n            httpd.serve_forever()\n\nYou can run the above example directly using the included wsgiref server:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install falcon\n    $ python things.py\n\nThen, in another terminal:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ curl localhost:8000/things\n\nA more complex example\n----------------------\n\nHere is a more involved example that demonstrates reading headers and\nquery parameters, handling errors, and working with request and response\nbodies.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # examples/things_advanced.py\n    import json\n    import logging\n    import uuid\n    from wsgiref import simple_server\n\n    import falcon\n    import requests\n\n\n    class StorageEngine:\n\n        def get_things(self, marker, limit):\n            return [{\'id\': str(uuid.uuid4()), \'color\': \'green\'}]\n\n        def add_thing(self, thing):\n            thing[\'id\'] = str(uuid.uuid4())\n            return thing\n\n\n    class StorageError(Exception):\n\n        @staticmethod\n        def handle(ex, req, resp, params):\n            description = ("Sorry, couldn\'t write your thing to the "\n                           \'database.
