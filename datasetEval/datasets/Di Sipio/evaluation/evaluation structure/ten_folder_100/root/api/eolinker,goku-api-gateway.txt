When you build websites, apps, IOT, and even API transactions, Goku API Gateway can help you extract duplicate components from your internal system and place them on the Goku gateway, such as user authorization, access control, traffic monitoring, firewalls, data cache, data conversion and so on.\n\nGoku API Gateway CE provides comprehensive usage guide and customization guide. Goku is written in pure Go language, with good performance and scalability, and the built-in plug-in system enables enterprises to customize development for their own business.\n\nGoku API Gateway also can combine with EOLINK API Studio to enhance API Management,API Monitor and Automated test.\n\nAll in all, Goku API Gateway enables enterprise to focus on their business.\n\n[![Stargazers over time](https://starchart.cc/eolinker/goku-api-gateway.svg)](#)\n\n# Product Features\n- **Dashboard**: Built-in dashboard to configure Goku.\n- **Cluster Management**\xef\xbc\x9aGoku nodes are stateless and can be expanded horizontally. Also the configuration can be synchronized automatically.\n- **Hot Updates**: Continuously updates configurations without restart nodes.\n- **Orchestration**\xef\xbc\x9aOrchestration can correspond to multiple backends. The backend input parameter supports the client incoming, and also supports the parameter transfer between backend. The return data of backend supports filter, delete, move, rename, target and group. API can set the exception return when the orchestration call fails.\n- **Data transform ** :Support for converting returned data to JSON or XML.\n- **Load balancing**: Round-robin load balancing with weight.\n- **Service Discovery**: Service discorvery from Consul or Eureka.\n- **HTTP(S) Forward Proxy**: Hide real backend services, support Rest API, Webservice.\n- **Multi-tenant management**: According to different strategies to regnorize different users.\n- **Strategies**: Support different strategies to access different APIs, configure different authentication (anonymous, Apikey, Basic) and so on.\n- **API Alert**: Support the webhook and email to alert abnormal services.\n- **Flexible transmit rules**: support fuzzy matching request path, support rewriting transmit path, etc.\n- **IP Whitelist/Blacklist**\n- **Custom plugins**: Allow plugins to be mounted in common phases, such as before match, access, and proxy.\n- **CLI**: Start\\stop\\reload Goku through the command line.\n- **Serverless**: Invoke functions in each phase in Goku.\n- **Access Log**:Only record the basic content in proxy, customize the record fields and sort order, and automatically clean up the logs periodically.\n- **System Log**:Provide running logs of consoles and nodes,only record the error information, adjust the level to INFO, WARN or DEBUG according to the actual situation.\n- **Scalability**: plug-in mechanism is easy to extend.\n- **High performance**: Performance excels among many gateways.\n- **Open API**\xef\xbc\x9aProvide OPEN API for users to operate on the gateway for easy integration.\n- **Configured version management** : Support for the release of operations and multiple rollbacks.\n- **Monitoring and indicators**: Support for Prometheus, Graphite.\n\n# Benchmark\n![](https://data.eolinker.com/p7NFG6lb4c73b26cc880e838fe45aa31bc037b7415e3770.jpg)\n[Benchmark Detail](https://help.eolinker.com/#/tutorial/?groupID=c-362&productID=19#tip7 "Benchmark Detail")\n\n# Console Preview\n[Console Preview Detail](https://github.com/eolinker/goku-api-gateway/blob/master/docs/CONSOLE_PREVIEW.md "See Console Preview")\n\n# Quick Start\n* [Deployment Tutorial](https://help.eolinker.com/#/tutorial/?groupID=c-371&productID=19 "Deployment Tutorial")\n* [Docker for Console](https://hub.docker.com/r/eolinker/goku-api-gateway-ce-console "Docker for Console")\xe3\x80\x81[Docker for Gateway Node](https://hub.docker.com/r/eolinker/goku-api-gateway-ce-node "Docker for Gateway Node")\n* [Quick Start](https://help.eolinker.com/#/tutorial/?groupID=c-307&productID=19 "Quick Start Tutorial")\n* [Source Code Compilation](https://help.eolinker.com/#/tutorial/?groupID=c-350&productID=19 "Source Code Compilation")\n\n# Enterprise Support\nGoku API Gateway EE (Enterprise Version) has more powerful functions, plug-in libraries and professional technical support services.
