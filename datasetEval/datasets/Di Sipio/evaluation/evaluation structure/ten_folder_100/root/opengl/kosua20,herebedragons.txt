b"# Here be dragons\n\n> Hic sunt dracones.\n\nThis repository contains multiple implementations of the same 3D scene, using different APIs and frameworks on various platforms. The goal is to provide a comparison between multiple rendering methods. This is inherently biased due to the variety of algorithms used and available CPU/GPU configurations, but can hopefully still provide interesting insights on 3D rendering.\n\n![](image.png)\n\nThe following versions are currently available:\n\n- [OpenGL](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/opengl)\n- [WebGL](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/webgl) \n- [Vulkan](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/vulkan) \n- [Metal](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/metal)\n- [SceneKit](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/scenekit)\n- [Unity](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/unity)\n- [Blender Cycles](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/cycles)\n- [Ptah](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/ptah) (a custom real-time renderer, see [the Github page](https://github.com/kosua20/PtahRenderer/))\n- [Nintendo DS](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/nds)\n- [Nintendo Game Boy Advance](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/gba)\n- [PlayStation 2](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/ps2)  \n- [PICO-8](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/pico8) \n\nThe following versions are (tentatively) planned:\n\n- DirectX, OpenGL ES\n- other console hardwares\n- another raytracing\n\nIn the directory of each version, one can find the source code, the corresponding resources (as each method has its own format/quality constraints), along with a readme describing the method and a few examples. The only exception is the OpenGL project, which is described below.\n\n## Resources\nThe scene is composed of four main elements:\n\n- a plane representing the ground, with a pavement texture.\n- a dragon (the Stanford dragon).\n- a monkey head ('Suzanne') rotating around its vertical axis.\n- a skybox surrounding the scene, textured with a cloudy sky.\n\nAdditionally, the sun is simulated by using a directional light, and the camera should be able to rotate around the scene.\nThe initial 3D models and textures are contained in the `opengl/resources` [directory](https://github.com/kosua20/herebedragons/tree/master/opengl/resources).\n\n## Other implementations\nHere you can find implementations using some of the above APIs combined with other programming languages, submitted by awesome people!\n\n- An OpenGL + Python version, by cprogrammer1994: [herebedragons-python](https://github.com/cprogrammer1994/herebedragons-python).
