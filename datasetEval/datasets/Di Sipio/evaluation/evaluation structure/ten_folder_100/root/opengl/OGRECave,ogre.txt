The class library abstracts all the details of\nusing the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and\nprovides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive\nclasses.\n\n| Build | Status |\n|-------|-----------------|\n| Ubuntu, OSX, Android, iOS | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OGRECave/ogre.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OGRECave/ogre) |\n| MSVC | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/kcki7y0n1ahrggdw/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/paroj/ogre-bsrh7/branch/master) |\n\n## Index Of Contents\n* [What's New?](Docs/1.12-Notes.md)  \nA summary of the new and altered features in this release.\n* [Building the core OGRE libraries](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/api/latest/building-ogre.html)  \nIf you're using the full source release, this will help you build it. If you're using a precompiled SDK then most of the work has already been done for you, and you should use the sample projects to see how to compile your own code against OGRE.\n* [The OGRE Manual](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/api/latest/manual.html)  \nA high-level guide to the major parts of the engine and script reference.\n* [API Reference](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/api/latest/)  \nThe full OGRE API documentation, as generated from the (heavily!) commented source.\n* [The OGRE Tutorials](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/api/latest/tutorials.html)  \nA gold mine of tutorials, tips and code snippets which will help you get up to speed with the engine.\n\n## Try it\n* [Online Emscripten Demo](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/emscripten/)\n* [Linux Snap Package](https://snapcraft.io/ogre)\n* [Android App on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.ogre.browser/)\n\n## Features\n\nFor an exhaustive list, see the [features page](http://www.ogre3d.org/about/features) and try our Sample Browser.
