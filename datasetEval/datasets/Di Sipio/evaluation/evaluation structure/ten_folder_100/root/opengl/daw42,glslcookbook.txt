b'\n:tada: **NEW** *The [3rd Edition is now available][cookbookv3]!!!* :tada:\n\nExample code from the [OpenGL Shading Language Cookbook, 2nd Edition][cookbook]\n=========================================================\n\nThe example code from the [OpenGL Shading Language Cookbook, 2nd Edition][cookbook],\nby David Wolff and published by Packt Publishing, 2013 (ISBN: 9781782167020).\n\nRecent changes:\n * Most examples now run on MacOS!\n * CMake build now uses package config files when finding GLM and GLFW.  This should make for a more\n streamlined configuration.  Use [`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`][cmake_prefix] to point CMake to your installs.\n * Examples now properly support high-density displays.\n\nRequirements\n-------------\nTo compile these examples, you\'ll need the following:\n\n* The [GLM Mathematics Library][GLM] version 0.9.6 or later.  Note that versions\n  prior to 0.9.6 may not work properly because of a switch from degrees to\n  radians.  GLM 0.9.5 will work, but you\'ll need to add `#define GLM_FORCE_RADIANS`\n  prior to including the glm header files.\n* [GLFW][] version 3.0 or later.\n\nCompiling the examples\n----------------------\nThe example code builds with [CMake][].  Note that the\nexamples for Chapter 10 will not function on MacOS due to lack of support for\ncompute shaders on that platform.\n\n1.  Install [GLFW][] by following the instructions on their [web site][GLFW].\n2.  Install the latest version of [GLM][].  Note that for [CMake][] to find GLM\n    correctly, you need to run the install "build" (e.g. `make install`) or install GLM from your\n    favorite package manager.  Otherwise, the CMake config files will not be created/available.\n3.  Download this example code from [github][ghcookbook], or clone using git.\n4.  Run cmake.  If cmake has difficulties finding the GLFW or GLM installations,\n    set the variable [`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`][cmake_prefix] to help cmake find them.\n5.  Compile by running `make`.\n\nAny problems, [create an issue](https://github.com/daw42/glslcookbook/issues) on [github][ghcookbook].\n\nTips for compiling for Windows with Visual Studio\n---------------------------------------------\n* Use the Visual Studio target in [CMake][]:  `-G "Visual Studio..."`, open the\n  Visual Studio solution.  You should see one project per chapter.\n* Each chapter requires a command line argument to choose a recipe.  When\n  running in VS, be sure to set the \'Command Argument\' under \'Properties\' for\n  the appropriate recipe.\n\nOpenGL Function Loading\n-----------------------\n\nAn OpenGL header file and a function loader for a 4.3 core profile are\nincluded with this project.  They were generated using\n[GLAD][].  This loader should also work on MacOS under a 4.1 core profile, but of course not all functions will load.\n\nThe code has been tested with OpenGL 4.3 on Windows/Linux and OpenGL 4.1 on MacOS.\n\n[GLM]: http://glm.g-truc.net\n[GLFW]:  http://glfw.org\n[ghcookbook]:  http://github.com/daw42/glslcookbook\n[cookbook]: http://www.packtpub.com/opengl-4-shading-language-cookbook-second-edition/book\n[cookbookv3]: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/OpenGL-4-Shading-Language-Cookbook-Third-Edition\n[GLLoadGen]:  https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/glloadgen/wiki/Home\n[CMake]: http://www.cmake.org/\n[GLAD]: https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad\n[cmake_prefix]: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html\n'
