b'# SHADERed\n\nSHADERed is a lightweight tool for creating and testing **HLSL and GLSL shaders**. It is easy to use,\nopen source, cross-platform (runs on Windows & Linux - HLSL shaders work on both OS) and frequently updated with new features.\n\n**[13.10.2019] Development slowed down due to me working on [ShaderDebugger](https://github.com/dfranx/ShaderDebugger)**\n\n<img src="./Screenshots/IMG2.png"/>\n\n## Partners / Sponsors\n...\n\nContact: **dfranx00 at gmail dot com**\n\n## Supporters\n**Silver supporter(s):**\n[Hugo Locurcio](https://github.com/Calinou)\n\n\n## Support\nSupport the development of this project on Patreon: [<img width="120" src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button@2x.png">](https://www.patreon.com/dfranx)\n\nYou can support the development of this project via **PayPal**: [<img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/en_US/i/buttons/pp-acceptance-medium.png" alt="Buy now with PayPal" />](https://paypal.me/dfranx) \n\nMy e-mail address for businesses (or if you just want to contact me):\n**dfranx00 at gmail dot com**\n\n## Features\n\n### Compute & geometry shaders\nYou are not limited to vertex and pixel shaders. SHADERed also has support for compute & geometry\nshaders. To use GS enable it in your shader pass\' properties and set the path to your shader. You can create advanced\nanimations and effects using geometry shaders.\n<p align="center">\n    <img width="200" src="./Screenshots/geometryshader.gif">\n</p>\n\nYou can also add **compute pass**es alongside shader passes:\n<p align="center">\n    <img width="200" src="./Screenshots/computeshader.gif">\n</p>\n\n### See changes instantly\nSHADERed offers different ways of recompiling your changed shaders. You can press\nF5 to manually recompile your shader, make it recompile shaders on file modify event (this also allows\nyou to use external editors with ease) or make it recompile shaders every 200ms:\n<img src="./Screenshots/instantresult.gif">\n\nSince the built-in text editor is buggy in the latest version, you can turn on\nthe `"Recompile shader on file change"` and `"Open shaders in an external editor"` options.\nOpen the shader files in an external editor & once you make changes to the file, SHADERed will instantly\ndetect them and recompile your shaders:\n<img src="./Screenshots/detectfilechange.gif">\n\nWant to see how a certain object affects your scene? Grab the object and scale, rotate and move it\naround the scene:\n<img src="./Screenshots/gizmo.gif">\n\n### Render states\nYou can modify rasterizer, blend and depth-stencil states. Using these states you can: turn on wireframe mode,\ndisable depth test, use stencil buffer, disable culling, custom blending, etc... All those things help you achieve even more advanced effects.\n\n### 3D models, textures (2D, 3D, cubemaps) & audio files\nYou can add music and create amazing visualizers!\n\nCustom 3D models can also be easily added to the scene. You can also use built-in geometry objects such as cubes, spheres, planes,\nfull screen quads, etc...\n\nLoad textures from files and bind them to your shader. SHADERed also supports cubemaps & 3D textures.\n<p align="center">\n    <img width="260" src="./Screenshots/texture.jpg">\n</p>\n\n### Render textures\nYou can render your scene to custom render textures. You can bind multiple render textures\nto one shader pass. This helps with create G-Buffers and similar things more easily. \n<p align="center">\n    <img width="220" src="./Screenshots/multiplert.jpg">\n</p>\n\n### Shader input variables\nYou can create your own variables and edit their values in real time. SHADERed also comes with lots of built-in \'system\' shader variables (elapsed time, window size, various\nview matrices, etc...).\n<img src="./Screenshots/varmanager.jpg">\n\nYou can also change shader variable value only for a specific 3D object. No programming is required.\n<p align="center">\n    <img width="400" src="./Screenshots/itemvarvalue.gif">\n</p>\n\n### Zooming in & pausing\nWorking on an antialiasing shader? You can zoom in and inspect edges of 3D objects.\nHold ALT and select an area that you want to look at in more detail\n<p align="center">\n    <img width="400" src="./Screenshots/zoomin.gif"><br/>\n    <em>Shader made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcAlTqd9zID6aNX3TzwxJXg">The Art Of Code</a></em>\n</p>\n\n### Workspace\nYou can modify SHADERed workspace however you want to thanks to Omar Cornut\'s great work on\n[Dear ImGUI\'s docking branch](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/docking), which implements window docking.\n\n### Error markers\nThe built-in code editor has error markers. They help you locate and identify your shader errors more easily.\nHover over a line with an error to see the message or just check it in the "Output" window.\n<p align="center">\n    <img width="370" src="./Screenshots/error.jpg">\n</p>\n\n**NOTE: You are not forced to use the built-in code editor** (and you probably shouldn\'t use it right now to avoid some\nannoying bugs).\n\n### Custom themes\nYou can create your own SHADERed theme. SHADERed themes allow you to\ncustomize everything. SHADERed comes with a few built-in themes. I am bad at designing \nso please submit your custom themes!\n\nWant to create your own theme but don\'t know how? Visit [TUTORIAL.md](./TUTORIAL.md).\n\n### Custom templates\nYou can create your own custom templates. SHADERed comes with a GLSL, HLSL and HLSL deferred rendering template.\nTemplates help you start developing shaders quickly. To create your own project template, paste your project\ndirectory in the "templates" directory and name your project file `template.sprj`. You have to reopen SHADERed if it was\nalready running to see the template under `File -> New`. A menu item for creating a template will\nhave the same text as the parent directory of the template.\n\n### And many more\nInstancing, buffers, audio shaders, ability to have more than one camera, shader macros, pausing time, input layout/vertex attribute manager, export as image and image sequence, variable pointers, etc...\nCheck out the list of features that I want to implement in near future: [TODO.md](./TODO.md)\n\n## Binaries\nYou can download precompiled binaries here: [Releases](https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed/releases)\n\n## Building\nFirst clone the project & submodules:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed.git\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\n```\n\n### Linux\nInstall all the libraries that are needed:\n```\n# Ubuntu\nsudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsfml-dev libglew-dev libglm-dev libassimp-dev libgtk-3-dev\n# Fedora\nsudo dnf install assimp-devel SFML-devel glm-devel glew-devel SDL2-devel gtk3-devel\n```\n\nBuild:\n```\ncmake .\nmake\n```\n\n**NOTE:** If you dont have SFML 2.5 installed on your machine, run these commands:\n```\ncmake -DUSE_FINDSFML=ON .\nmake\n```\n\nRun:\n```\n./bin/SHADERed\n```\n\n### Windows\n1. Install SDL2, SFML, GLEW, GLM, ASSIMP through your favourite package manager (I recommend vcpkg)\n2. Run cmake-gui and set CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable\n3. Press Configure and then Generate if no errors occured\n4. Open the .sln and build the project!\n\n## Tutorial\nDon\'t know how or where to start?
