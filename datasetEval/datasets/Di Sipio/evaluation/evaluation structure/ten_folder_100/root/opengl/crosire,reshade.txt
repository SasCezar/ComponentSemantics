b'ReShade\n=======\n\nThis is a generic post-processing injector for games and video software. It exposes an automated way to access both frame color and depth information and a custom shader language called ReShade FX to write effects like ambient occlusion, depth of field, color correction and more which work everywhere.\n\n## Building\n\nYou\'ll need Visual Studio 2017 or higher to build ReShade and Python for the `gl3w` dependency. The [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) is required if building with Vulkan support.\n\n1. Clone this repository including all Git submodules\n2. Open the Visual Studio solution\n3. Select either the "32-bit" or "64-bit" target platform and build the solution (this will build ReShade and all dependencies).\n\nAfter the first build, a `version.h` file will show up in the [res](/res) directory. Change the `VERSION_FULL` definition inside to something matching the current release version and rebuild so that shaders from the official repository at https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders won\'t cause a version mismatch error during compilation.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny contributions to the project are welcomed, it\'s recommended to use GitHub [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\n## License\n\nAll source code in this repository is licensed under a [BSD 3-clause license](LICENSE.md).\n'
