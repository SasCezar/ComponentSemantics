b'# thi.ng/geom\n\n![SVO mesh created with geom-voxel module](assets/svo-d7.jpg)\n\n(https://conventionalcommits.org/)\n[![Discord chat](https://img.shields.io/discord/445761008837984256.svg)](https://discord.gg/JhYcmBw)\n\nComprehensive and modular geometry toolkit for Clojure/ClojureScript\ndeveloped in a literate programming style.\n\nCurrently BETA quality, largely stable, but pre-release software. The\nlibraries have been used in production for several projects, but\nfurther breaking API changes are still forthcoming...\n\n**Note:** This library relies on the new\nconditional reader syntax of recent Clojure & Clojurescript versions\nand therefore is **not compatible with Clojure versions < 1.7.0**...\n\n## Description & usage\n\n~~See [index.org](src/index.org) for details. Also please note, the\n[dev branch](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom/tree/develop) is (as one\nmight expect) often quite a bit ahead of master and I\'m aiming to push\nat least weekly snapshots of all modules to\n[clojars.org](http://clojars.org)...~~\n\nUpdate 2018: I gave in to community demand and have converted the project to use\nstandard CLJC sources and **NOT** rely on org-mode any longer. This\nversion also constitutes the currently latest version and can be found\nin the [no-org branch](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom/tree/feature/no-org/)\nof this repo.\n\n## Current Leiningen coordinates\n\n```clj\n[thi.ng/geom "1.0.0-RC4"]\n```\n\n## Getting started\n\nTutorials are non-existing so far, but are on the TODO list. However for examples, there are various snippets lingering throughout the codebase and various workshop repos:\n\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/geom/blob/master/src/index.org#example-usage\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/geom/blob/master/geom-viz/src/core.org#example-usage\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/geom/blob/master/geom-svg/src/examples.org\n\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/ws-ldn-1\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/ws-ldn-2\nhttps://github.com/learn-postspectacular/resonate-workshop-2015\nhttps://github.com/learn-postspectacular/resonate-workshop-2014\n\nhttps://github.com/cassiel/thi-ng-geom-starter\n\n## Project overview\n\n![project overview](assets/overview.png)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2013-2015 Karsten Schmidt\n\nDistributed under the\n[Apache Software License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n'
