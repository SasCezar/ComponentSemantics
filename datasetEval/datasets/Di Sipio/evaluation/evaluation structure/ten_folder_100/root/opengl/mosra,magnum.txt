b"Magnum \xe2\x80\x94 *Lightweight and modular C++11/C++14 graphics middleware for games and data visualization*\n\nLooking for an open-source library that gives you graphics abstraction and\nplatform independence on major desktop, mobile and web platforms? Do you want\nit to have all the convenience utilities around yet stay small, powerful and\nnot give up on flexibility? *Here it is.* And it's free to use, even for\ncommercial purposes.\n\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/mosra/magnum](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/mosra/magnum?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mosra/magnum.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mosra/magnum)\n[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/5b477m034cfaskse/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mosra/magnum/branch/master)\n[![Coverage Status](https://codecov.io/gh/mosra/magnum/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/mosra/magnum)\n[![Hunter Package](https://img.shields.io/badge/hunter-magnum-lightgrey.svg)](https://docs.hunter.sh/en/latest/packages/pkg/magnum.html)\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n-   Project homepage \xe2\x80\x94 https://magnum.graphics/\n-   Documentation \xe2\x80\x94 https://doc.magnum.graphics/\n-   GitHub project page \xe2\x80\x94 https://github.com/mosra/magnum\n\nBeauty of simplicity\n====================\n\nAmong Magnum essentials is a UTF-8-aware OS, filesystem and console\nabstraction, a feature-packed vector math library and a slim C++11 wrapper of\nOpenGL / WebGL family of APIs. Build on top of that or opt-in for more.\n\n[See all core features](https://magnum.graphics/features/)\n\nWith batteries included\n=======================\n\nShaders and primitives for fast prototyping, algorithms, debugging and\nautomatic testing, asset management, integration with popular windowing\ntoolkits and a UI library. Everything fits together but you still have a\nchoice.\n\n[List the extra features](https://magnum.graphics/features/extras/)\n\nScrews are not glued in\n=======================\n\nThere's always more than one way to do things. Enjoy the freedom of choice and\nintegrate your own asset loader, texture compressor, font format or math\nlibrary, if you feel the need. Or use any of the various plugins.\n\n[View extension points](https://magnum.graphics/features/extensions/)\n\n-------\n\n*Wondering if Magnum is a good fit for your project?* We prepared\n[a few case studies](https://magnum.graphics/is-magnum-what-i-am-looking-for/)\nto help you decide.\n\nSUPPORTED PLATFORMS\n===================\n\n-   **Linux** and embedded Linux\n-   **Windows**, **Windows RT** (Store/Phone)\n-   **macOS**, **iOS**\n-   **Android**\n-   **Web** ([asm.js](http://asmjs.org/) or [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/)),\n    through [Emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/)\n\nGraphics APIs:\n\n-   **OpenGL** 2.1 through 4.6, core profile functionality and modern\n    extensions\n-   **OpenGL ES** 2.0, 3.0\xe2\x80\x933.2 and extensions to match desktop OpenGL\n    functionality\n-   **WebGL** 1.0, 2.0 and extensions to match desktop OpenGL functionality\n\nSee the [Build Status page](https://magnum.graphics/build-status/) for detailed\nper-platform build status.\n\nWHAT'S NEW?\n===========\n\nCurious about what was added or improved recently? Check out the\n[Changelog](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/changelog.html#changelog-latest)\npage in the documentation.\n\nGETTING STARTED\n===============\n\nThe best way to get started is to read the thorough\n[download, build, install and start using Magnum](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/getting-started.html)\nin your project. There is also a complete\n[building documentation](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/building.html) \xe2\x80\x94 we\nprovide packages for many platforms, including Windows, Linux and macOS. After\nthat, there are various [tutorials and examples](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/example-index.html)\nand a complete [feature guide](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/features.html)\nexplaining all aspects of the library.\n\nApart from that, various Magnum functionality is available through\n[single-header libraries](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/singles.html).\nJust download a file, `#include` it in your project and you're ready to go! No\nbuildsystem wrangling needed.\n\nRELATED PROJECTS\n================\n\nThe engine itself is kept as small as possible with only a few dependencies.\nAdditional functionality, often depending on external libraries, is provided in\nseparate repositories.\n\n-   **Corrade** \xe2\x80\x94 main Magnum dependency, a multiplatform utility library:\n    https://github.com/mosra/corrade\n-   **Magnum Bootstrap** \xe2\x80\x94 bootstrap projects for many use cases, helping you\n    get up and running in no time: https://github.com/mosra/magnum-bootstrap\n-   **Magnum Plugins** \xe2\x80\x94 various importer plugins for image, font, audio and\n    3D model formats are at https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins\n-   **Magnum Integration** \xe2\x80\x94 integration with various external math and\n    physics, get it at https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration\n-   **Magnum Examples** \xe2\x80\x94 examples of engine usage, varying from simple\n    *Hello World*-like example to more advanced applications, such as viewer\n    for complex 3D models.
