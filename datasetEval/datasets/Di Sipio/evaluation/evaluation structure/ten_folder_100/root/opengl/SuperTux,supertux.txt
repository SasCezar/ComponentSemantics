Suddenly, a creature jumped from behind an ice bush, there\nwas a flash, and Tux fell asleep!\n\nWhen Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny is missing. Where she lay\nbefore now lies a letter:\n>Tux, my arch enemy! I have captured your beautiful Penny and have\n>taken her to my fortress. The path to my fortress is littered with my\n>minions. Give up on the thought of trying to reclaim her, you haven\'t\n>got a chance!\n>\n>-Nolok\n\nTux looks and sees Nolok\'s fortress in the distance. Determined to\nsave his beloved Penny, he begins his journey.\n\n## Installation\n\nFor major platforms, stable releases are built and available for download from\n[supertux.org](https://www.supertux.org/download.html) or alternatively directly\nfrom [GitHub](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/releases). You should be able\nto install these using default tools provided by your platform. On macOS, when\nGatekeeper is enabled (default) it will refuse to open SuperTux. This is due to\nthe lack of a signature on the application. If you wish to open SuperTux anyway\nwithout disabling the Gatekeeper feature entirely, you can open the application\nfrom the context menu (control click on the icon). macOS will then remember your\nchoice the next time.\n\n## Documentation\n\nImportant documentation for SuperTux is contained in multiple files.\nPlease see them:\n\n* `INSTALL.md` - Requirements, compiling and installing.\n* `README.md` - This file\n* `NEWS.md` - Changes since the previous versions of SuperTux.\n* `LICENSE.txt` - The GNU General Public License, under whose terms SuperTux is\nlicensed. (Most of the data subdirectory is also licensed under\nCC-by-SA)\n* `docs/levelguidelines.txt` - Very useful information for those that want to\ndesign levels for SuperTux.\n* `data/credits.stxt` - Credits for people that contributed to the creation of\nSuperTux. (You can view these in the game menu as well.)\n\n\n## Playing the game\n\nBoth keyboards and joysticks/gamepads are supported. You can change\nthe controls via the Options menu. Basically, the only keys you will\nneed to use in-game are to do the following actions: jump, duck,\nright, left, action and \'P\' to pause/unpause the game. There isn\'t much\nto tell about the first few, but the "action" key allows you to pick\nup objects and use any powerup you got. For instance, with the fire\nflower, you can shoot fireballs, or with the ice flower fire ice pellets.\n\nOther useful keys include the Esc key, which is used to go to the menu\nor to go up a level in the menu. The menu can be navigated using the\narrow keys or the mouse.\n\nIn the worldmap, the arrow keys are used to navigate and Enter to\nenter the current level.\n\n## Community\n\nIn case you need help, feel free to reach out using the following means:\n\n* **IRC:** [#supertux](ircs://chat.freenode.net/#supertux) on\n  [freenode](https://freenode.net) hosts most of the discussions between\n  developers. Also, real-time support can be provided here. If you don\'t know\n  how to use an IRC client, you access the channel using a web-based\n  [client](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net:+6697/?nick=Guest?#supertux).\n  Please stay around after asking questions, otherwise you will be disconnected\n  and might miss potential answers.\n* **Matrix:** [#supertux:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#supertux:matrix.org)\n  is bridged to our IRC room.\n* **[Forum](https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=66):** The SuperTux\n  community is very active on the forum, the discussion ranges from feature\n  proposals to support questions. In particular, most community-contributed\n  add-ons are published there first, so this is worth checking.\n* **Mailing Lists:** The\n  [supertux-devel](http://lists.lethargik.org/listinfo.cgi/supertux-devel-lethargik.org)\n  mailing list is intended for development purposes. However, it is not very\n  active at the moment.\n* **Social Media:** Mostly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/supertux_team) at\n  the moment.\n\n## Development status\n\nWith the release of SuperTux 0.6.0 (December 2018), the Forest World finally found\nit\'s way back to the core part of the game. It\'s now considered stable, but it\nstill misses the second half, which consists of the ghostforest and the boss\nof the Forest World. The Team will continue with the development of the Forest\nWorld, and, as always, constructive feedback and contributions regarding\nthe game is highly welcome.\n'
