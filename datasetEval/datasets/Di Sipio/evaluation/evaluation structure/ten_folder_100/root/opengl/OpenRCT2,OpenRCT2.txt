Introduction\n\n**OpenRCT2** is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 (RCT2). The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an amusement park containing attractions, shops and facilities. The player must try to make a profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst keeping the guests happy. OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox play. Scenarios require the player to complete a certain objective in a set time limit whilst sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible park with optionally no restrictions or finance.\n\nRollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was originally written by Chris Sawyer in x86 assembly and is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon. The engine was based on Transport Tycoon, an older game which also has an equivalent open-source project, [OpenTTD](http://openttd.org). OpenRCT2 attempts to provide everything from RCT2 as well as many improvements and additional features, some of these include support for modern platforms, an improved interface, improved guest and staff AI, more editing tools, increased limits, and cooperative multiplayer. It also re-introduces mechanics from RollerCoaster Tycoon that were not present in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Some of those include; mountain tool in-game, the *"have fun"* objective, launched coasters (not passing-through the station) and several buttons on the toolbar.\n\n---\n\n# 2. Downloading the game (pre-built)\n\nOpenRCT2 requires original files of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 to play. It can be bought at either [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/) or [GOG.com](http://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2). If you have the original RollerCoaster Tycoon and its expansion packs, you can [point OpenRCT2 to these](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Loading-RCT1-scenarios-and-data) in order to play the original scenarios.\n\n[OpenRCT2.org](https://openrct2.org/downloads) offers precompiled builds and installers of the latest master and the develop branch. There is also a cross platform [Launcher](https://github.com/LRFLEW/OpenRCT2Launcher/releases) available that will automatically update your build of the game so that you always have the latest version.\n\nSome Linux distributions offer native packages already. These packages are usually third-party, but we\'re trying to resolve issues they are facing.\n* ArchLinux AUR: [openrct2-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openrct2-git) and [openrct2](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openrct2)\n* Ubuntu PPA: [`develop` branch](https://launchpad.net/~openrct2/+archive/ubuntu/nightly) (nightly builds)\n* openSUSE OBS: [games/openrct2](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=games&package=openrct2)\n* Gentoo (main portage tree): [games-simulation/openrct2](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/games-simulation/openrct2)\n* NixOS (`nixos-unstable` channel): [openrct2](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/games/openrct2/default.nix)\n* Fedora 28 i386/amd64: [openrct2](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/nauticalnexus/openrct2/)\n\nSome \\*BSD operating systems offer native packages. These packages are usually third-party, but we\'re trying to resolve issues they are facing.\n* OpenBSD: [games/openrct2](http://openports.se/games/openrct2)\n\n---\n\n# 3. Building the game\n\n## 3.1 Building prerequisites\n\nOpenRCT2 requires original files of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 to play. It can be bought at either [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/) or [GOG.com](http://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2).\n\n### Windows:\n- 7 / 8 / 10\n- Visual Studio 2017 update 7 (Enterprise / Professional / [Community (Free)](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/))\n  - Desktop development with C++\n  - [Windows 10 SDK (10.0.14393.0)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=838916)\n- [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) (for deployment only)\n- [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/) (for deployment only)\n\n\n### macOS:\n- Xcode 8\n\nThe program can also be built as a command line program using CMake. This type of build requires:\n\n- Xcode Command Line Tools\n- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)\n- CMake (available through Homebrew)\n\n\n### Linux:\n- sdl2 (only for UI client)\n- freetype (can be disabled)\n- fontconfig (can be disabled)\n- libzip (>= 1.0)\n- libpng (>= 1.2)\n- speexdsp (only for UI client)\n- curl (only if building with http support)\n- jansson (>= 2.5)\n- openssl (>= 1.0; only if building with multiplayer support)\n- icu (>= 59.0)\n- zlib\n- gl (commonly provided by Mesa or GPU vendors; only for UI client, can be disabled)\n- cmake\n\n---\n\n## 3.2 Compiling and running\n### Windows:\n1. Check out the repository. This can be done using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or [other tools](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use).\n2. Open a new Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017, then navigate to the repository (e.g. `cd C:\\GitHub\\OpenRCT2`).\n3. To build the 64-bit version, use `msbuild openrct2.proj /t:build /p:platform=x64`.\n\n   To build the 32-bit version, use `msbuild openrct2.proj /t:build /p:platform=Win32`.\n4. Run the game, `bin\\openrct2`\n\nOnce you have ran msbuild once, further development can be done within Visual Studio by opening `openrct2.sln`. Make sure to select the correct target platform for which you ran the build in point #3 (`Win32` for the 32-bit version, `x64` for the 64-bit version), otherwise the build will fail in Visual Studio.\n\nOther examples:\n```\nset platform=x64\nmsbuild openrct2.proj /t:clean\nmsbuild openrct2.proj /t:rebuild /p:configuration=release\nmsbuild openrct2.proj /t:g2\nmsbuild openrct2.proj /t:PublishPortable\n```\n\n### macOS:\n#### Xcode:\nThe recommended way of building OpenRCT2 for macOS is with Xcode. The Xcode build will create a self-contained application bundles which include all the necessary game files and dependencies. Open the project file OpenRCT2.xcodeproj in Xcode and build from there. Building this way will handle the dependencies for you automatically. You can also invoke an Xcode build from the command line using `xcodebuild`.\n\n#### CMake:\nA command line version of OpenRCT2 can be built using CMake. This type of build requires you to provide the dependencies yourself. The supported method of doing this is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). Once you have Homebrew installed, you can download all the required libraries with this command:\n```\nbrew install cmake openssl jansson libpng sdl2 speexdsp libzip freetype pkg-config\n```\n\nOnce you have the dependencies installed, you can build the project using CMake using the following commands:\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake\nln -s ../data data\n```\nThen you can run the game by running `./openrct2`.\n\n### Linux:\nThe standard CMake build procedure is to install the [required libraries](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2#mac--linux), then:\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ../ # set your standard cmake options, e.g. build type here - For example, -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\nmake # you can parallelise your build job with e.g. -j8 or consider using ninja\nDESTDIR=. make install # the install target creates all the necessary files in places we expect them\n```\n\nYou can also use Ninja in place of Make, if you prefer, see Wiki for details.\n\nDetailed instructions can be found on our [wiki](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Building-OpenRCT2-on-Linux).\n\n---\n\n# 4. Contributing\nOpenRCT2 uses the [gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow). If you are implementing a new feature or logic from the original game, please branch off and perform pull requests to ```develop```. If you are fixing a bug for the next release, please branch off and perform pull requests to the correct release branch. ```master``` only contains tagged releases, you should never branch off this.\n\nPlease read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information.\n\n## 4.1 Bug fixes\nA list of bugs can be found on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/issues). Feel free to work on any bug and submit a pull request to the develop branch with the fix. Mentioning that you intend to fix a bug on the issue will prevent other people from trying as well.\n\n## 4.2 New features\nPlease talk to the OpenRCT2 team first before starting to develop a new feature. We may already have plans or reasons against it, therefore contacting us will allow us to help you or prevent you from wasting any time. You can talk to us via gitter, see links at the top of this page.\n\n## 4.3 Translation\nYou can translate the game into other languages by editing the language files in ```data/language``` directory. Please join discussions and submit pull requests to [OpenRCT2/Localisation](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/Localisation).\n\n## 4.4 Graphics\nYou can help create new graphics for the game by visiting the [OpenGraphics project](https://gitter.im/OpenRCT2/OpenGraphics). 3D modellers needed!\n\n## 4.5 Audio\nYou can help create the music and sound effects for the game, drop by [the OpenMusic chat](https://gitter.im/OpenRCT2/OpenMusic) to find out more.\n\n## 4.6 Scenarios\nWe also need need scenarios to distribute with the game, when the time comes. For that, we need talented scenario makers! Come chat with us [over here](https://gitter.im/PFCKrutonium/OpenRCT2-OpenScenarios)!\n\n---\n\n# 5.
