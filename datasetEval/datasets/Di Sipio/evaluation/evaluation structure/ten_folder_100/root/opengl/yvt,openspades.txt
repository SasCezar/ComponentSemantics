See the [Building Guide](https://github.com/yvt/openspades/wiki/Building), which may be up to date\n 2. Or [open an issue](https://github.com/yvt/openspades/issues) if the problem persists\n\n### On Linux\n\n#### Snap package\nOn [snap enabled](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install) systems, the latest pre-built stable release of OpenSpades can be installed with:\n\n```bash\nsudo snap install openspades\n```\nOnce installed, you'll be able to launch OpenSpades from inside the desktop menu or from your terminal with the `openspades`\n\n#### Flatpak package\nOn [flatpak enabled](https://flatpak.org/setup/) systems, OpenSpades can be installed with:\n\n```bash\nflatpak install flathub jp.yvt.OpenSpades\n```\n\nOnce installed, you'll be able to launch OpenSpades from inside the desktop menu or from your terminal with `flatpak run jp.yvt.OpenSpades`\n\n#### Building and installing from source\nGCC 4.9 / Clang 3.2 or later is recommended because OpenSpades relies on C++11 features heavily.\n\n1. Install dependencies:\n\n   *On Debian-derived distributions*:\n   ```\n   sudo apt-get install pkg-config libglew-dev libcurl3-openssl-dev libsdl2-dev \\\n     libsdl2-image-dev libalut-dev xdg-utils libfreetype6-dev libopus-dev \\\n     libopusfile-dev cmake imagemagick\n   ```\n   (because of a bug in some distributions, you might also\n   have to install more packages by `sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev libxinerama-dev libxft-dev`)\n\n   *On other distributions*:\n   Install corresponding packages from your repository (or compile from source).\n\n2. Clone OpenSpades repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/yvt/openspades.git && cd openspades\n   ```\n\n3. Create directory `openspades.mk` in cloned/downloaded openspades repo and compile:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir openspades.mk\n   cd openspades.mk\n   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo && make\n   ```\n\n4. Install OpenSpades (optional but recommended):\n\n   `sudo make install`\n\n   **note**: If you have a previous installation of OpenSpades, you have to uninstall it manually by `sudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/games/openspades` before installing a new one.\n\n5. Launch:\n\n   `openspades` (if installed) or `cd $REPO_DIRECTORY/openspades.mk; bin/OpenSpades` and enjoy\n\n\n### On Windows (with Visual Studio)\n1. Get the required software if you haven't already:\n  * CMake 2.8+\n  * PowerShell 5.0\n    * Integrated with Windows 10.\n    * Older versions are not tested, but might work\n  * *Visual Studio 2017*\n    * VS2015 is also supported, but VS2017 is more recommended\n    * VS2013 is no longer supported, but might work\n2. Grab the source code:\n  * Stable version: https://github.com/yvt/openspades/releases\n  * Latest development version (0.1.x): https://github.com/yvt/openspades/archive/master.zip\n3. Extract or checkout the source\n  * All examples will assume `E:/Projects/openspades`, update paths in the examples to reflect yours\n4. Get (pre-compiled) copies of glew, curl, sdl2 and zlib, and place them in `E:/Projects/openspades/Sources/Externals`\n  * See the file `E:/Projects/openspades/Sources/Externals/readme.txt` for details and links to pre-compiled sets of libraries for your version of Visual Studio\n5. Run CMake:\n  * Source: `E:/Projects/openspades`\n  * Binaries: `E:/Projects/openspades/OpenSpades.msvc`\n  * Generator:\n    * For VS2017: `Visual Studio 15 (2017)` (not Win64!)\n    * For VS2015: `Visual Studio 14 (2015)` (not Win64!)\n\n6. Open `E:/Projects/openspades/OpenSpades.msvc/OpenSpades.sln` in Visual Studio.\n7. Build the solution.\n * The recommended build configuration is `MinSizeRel` or `Release` if you're not an developer\n * The default build output directory is `E:/projects/OpenSpades/OpenSpades.msvc/bin/BUILD_TYPE/`\n8. Copy all `.dll` files from `Source/Externals/lib` to the build output directory.\n9. To get audio working, download a [Windows release of OpenSpades](https://github.com/yvt/openspades/releases), extract it, and copy the following dlls to the build output directory:\n * For OpenAL audio: `openal32.dll`\n * For YSR audio: `YSRSpades.dll`, `libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll`, `libstdc++-6.dll`, `pthreadGC2.dll`\n10. Download the [Non-free pak](https://github.com/yvt/openspades-paks/releases/download/r33/OpenSpadesDevPackage-r33.zip), extract it, and copy `Nonfree/pak000-Nonfree.pak` to the `Resources` folder inside your build output directory, which is probably `E:/Projects/openspades/openspades.msvc/bin/BUILD_TYPE/Resources`. You can also copy the paks contained in `Official Mods/` folder of OpenSpades 0.0.12b to add more fonts and improve localization support of your build.\n11. Copy `Resources/PackageInfo.json` to the `Resources` folder inside your build output directory.\n\n### On macOS (with Xcode)\n1. Get the latest version of Xcode and OpenSpades source.\n2. Get (pre-compiled) copies of libraries, and place them in `Sources/Externals`\n  * See the file `Sources/Externals/readme.txt` for details\n4. Download [macOS release of OpenSpades](https://github.com/yvt/openspades/releases), show the package contents, and copy `libysrspades.dylib` to `Sources/Externals/lib`.\n5. Download and extract the [Non-free pak](https://github.com/yvt/openspades-paks/releases/download/r33/OpenSpadesDevPackage-r33.zip). After that, copy `Nonfree/pak000-Nonfree.pak` and `font-unifont.pak` to `Resources/`.\n6. Open `OpenSpades.xcodeproj` and build.\n\n## Troubleshooting\nFor troubleshooting and common problems see [TROUBLESHOOTING](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).\n\n## Licensing\nPlease see the file named LICENSE.\n"
