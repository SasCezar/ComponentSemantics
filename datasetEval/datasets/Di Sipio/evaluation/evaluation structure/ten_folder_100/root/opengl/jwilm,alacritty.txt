With such a strong focus on performance, included features are\ncarefully considered and you can always expect Alacritty to be blazingly fast.\nBy making sane choices for defaults, Alacritty requires no additional setup.\nHowever, it does allow [configuration](#configuration) of many aspects of the\nterminal.\n\nThe software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness -- there are\na few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as\na daily driver.\n\nPrecompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/releases).\n\n## Further information\n\n- [Announcing Alacritty, a GPU-Accelerated Terminal Emulator](https://jwilm.io/blog/announcing-alacritty/) January 6, 2017\n- [A short talk about Alacritty at the Rust Meetup January 2017](https://air.mozilla.org/rust-meetup-january-2017/) (starts at 57:00)\n- [Alacritty Lands Scrollback, Publishes Benchmarks](https://jwilm.io/blog/alacritty-lands-scrollback/) September 17, 2018\n- [Version 0.3.0 Release Announcement](https://blog.christianduerr.com/alacritty_030_announcement) April 07, 2019\n\n## Installation\n\nSome operating systems already provide binaries for Alacritty, for everyone\nelse the instructions to build Alacritty from source can be found [here](INSTALL.md).\n\n### Arch Linux\n\n```sh\npacman -S alacritty\n```\n\n### Fedora\n\nUnofficial builds of stable tags can be found in Fedora Copr:\n[pschyska/alacritty](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/pschyska/alacritty/).\n\n``` sh\ndnf copr enable pschyska/alacritty\ndnf install alacritty\n```\n\nIf you want to help test pre-releases, you can additionally enable\n[pschyska/alacritty-testing](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/pschyska/alacritty-testing/).\n\n### Gentoo Linux\n\n```sh\nemerge x11-terms/alacritty\n```\n\n### Mageia\n\n```sh\nurpmi alacritty\n```\n\n### NixOS\n\n```sh\nnix-env -iA nixos.alacritty\n```\n\n### openSUSE Tumbleweed\n\n```sh\nzypper in alacritty\n```\n\n### Pop!\\_OS / Ubuntu\n\n> If you\'re not running Pop!_OS, you\'ll have to add a third party repository first:\n>\n> ```sh\n> add-apt-repository ppa:mmstick76/alacritty\n> ```\n\n```sh\napt install alacritty\n```\n\n### Solus\n\n```sh\neopkg install alacritty\n```\n\n### Void Linux\n\n```sh\nxbps-install alacritty\n```\n\n### FreeBSD\n\n```sh\npkg install alacritty\n```\n\n### macOS\n\n```sh\nbrew cask install alacritty\n```\n\nOnce the cask is installed, it is recommended to setup the [manual page](INSTALL.md#manual-page),\n[shell completions](INSTALL.md#shell-completions), and [terminfo definitions](INSTALL.md#terminfo).\n\n### Windows\n\n#### Via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)\n\n```batch\nchoco install alacritty\n```\n\n#### Via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh)\n\n```batch\nscoop bucket add extras\nscoop install alacritty\n```\n\n### Other\n\nPrebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows can be downloaded from the\n[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/releases).\n\nTo work properly on Windows, Alacritty requires winpty to emulate UNIX\'s PTY\nAPI. The agent is a single binary (`winpty-agent.exe`) which **must** be in\nthe same directory as the Alacritty executable and is available through the\n[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/releases).\n\nOn Windows, Alacritty also requires Microsoft\'s VC++ redistributable to work\nproperly.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can find the default configuration file with documentation for all available\nfields on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/releases) for each release.\n\nAlacritty looks for the configuration file at the following paths:\n\n1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.yml`\n2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.yml`\n3. `$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml`\n4. `$HOME/.alacritty.yml`\n\n### Windows\n\nOn Windows the config file is located at:\n\n`%APPDATA%\\alacritty\\alacritty.yml`\n\n## Contributing\n\nA full guideline about contributing to Alacritty can be found in the\n[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n## Issues (known, unknown, feature requests, etc.)\n\nIf you run into a problem with Alacritty, please file an issue. If you\'ve got a\nfeature request, feel free to ask about it. Please just keep in mind Alacritty\nis focused on simplicity and performance, and not all features are in line with\nthat goal.\n\nBefore opening a new issue, please check if it has already been reported.\nThere\'s a chance someone else has already reported it, and you can subscribe to\nthat issue to keep up on the latest developments.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**\n\nIn the terminals we\'ve [benchmarked](http://github.com/jwilm/vtebench),\nAlacritty is either faster or **way** faster than the others. If you\'ve found a\ncase where this isn\'t true, please report a bug.\n\n**_Why isn\'t feature X implemented?_**\n\nAlacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other\nterminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it\'s just not a\ngood fit for Alacritty. This means you won\'t find things like tabs or splits\n(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor\nniceties like a GUI config editor.\n\n**_macOS + tmux + vim is slow! I thought this was supposed to be fast!_**\n\nThis appears to be an issue outside of terminal emulators; either macOS has an\nIPC performance issue, or either tmux or vim (or both) have a bug. This same\nissue can be seen in `iTerm2` and `Terminal.app`. I\'ve found that if tmux is\nrunning on another machine which is connected to Alacritty via SSH, this issue\ndisappears. Actual throughput and rendering performance are still better in\nAlacritty.\n\n**_My arrow keys don\'t work._**\n\nIt sounds like you deleted some key bindings from your config file. Please\nreference the default config file to restore them.\n\n## IRC\n\nAlacritty discussion can be found in `#alacritty` on freenode.\n\n## Wayland\n\nWayland is used by default on systems that support it.
