b'OpenTK\n======\n\nOpenTK is a large project. There are many components to work on, and we\'d welcome almost any contribution. The community is friendly, welcoming and always ready to help you get your PRs merged!\n\nWe have a very active discord server, if you need help, want to help, or are just curious, come join us!\n\n[![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/337627185248468993/widget.png)](https://discord.gg/6HqD48s)\n\nThe Open Toolkit library is a fast, low-level C# binding for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and OpenAL. It runs on all major platforms and powers hundreds of apps, games and scientific research.\n\nUse OpenTK to add cross-platform 3d graphics, audio, compute and haptics to your C# application. Integrate it into your existing user interface or use it standalone without any external dependencies.\n\n\n\nProject website: https://opentk.net\n\nOfficial git repository: https://github.com/opentk/opentk\n\nBuild Status\n========\n\n| Platform       | Status         |\n| -------------- | -------------- |\n| Windows        | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/c9b9754wa0v1p9rb?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/varon/opentk) |\n| Mono/Linux     | [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/opentk/opentk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opentk/opentk) |\n\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n- Create cutting-edge graphics with OpenGL 4.6 and OpenGL ES 3.0\n- Spice up your GUI with 3d acceleration\n- Improve your code flow with strong types and inline documentation\n- Windowing systems to help get you started\n- Input, and other game essentials.\n- Performant, highly optimized and reliable linear algebra library\n- Write once run everywhere\n\nOpenTK is available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, *BSD, SteamOS, Android and iOS. It can be used standalone or integrated into a GUI (Windows.Forms, WPF, GTK+, Qt, VTK, ...)\n\n\nInstructions\n============\n\nOpenTK is available as a [NuGet Package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK/).\n\nNote what installing NuGet package will add reference to OpenTK.dll, but OpenTK.dll.config\nwill not be copied to the project output directory automatically, so you need to add it to your project\nand then enable the "Copy to Output Directory" option (as in step 3 below).\n\nNews\n===\n\n\n### 2019-08-04\n\nOpenTK 3.1.0 is available.\n\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK/3.1.0\n\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK.GLControl/3.1.0\n\n\n\n### 2018-10-19\n\nWork is well underway on OpenTK 4.0, which targets .netstandard 2.0.\n\nWe would welcome any contributions!\n\n[Click here](https://github.com/opentk/opentk/issues/823) to view the tracking issue.\n\n### 2018-06-07\n\nOpenTK 3.0.1 is available.\n\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK/3.0.1\n\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK.GLControl/3.0.1\n\n### 2018-01-05\n\nOpenTK 3.0.0 is available.\n\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK/3.0.0\n\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK.GLControl/3.0.0\n\n\nBuilding from source\n============\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/opentk/opentk   # Download source code from git\ncd opentk                                    # Enter the source directory\ndotnet build                                 # Build using .Net Core\n```\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nOpenTK uses and encourages [Early Pull Requests](https://medium.com/practical-blend/pull-request-first-f6bb667a9b6). Please don\'t wait until you\'re done to open a PR!\n\n1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and the [.Net Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)\n1. [Fork OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk/fork)\n1. Create a branch on your fork.\n1. Add an empty commit to start your work off (and let you open a PR): `git commit --allow-empty -m "start of [thing you\'re working on]"`\n1. Open a Pull request with `[WIP]` in the title. Do this **before** you actually start working.\n1. Make your commits in small, incremental steps with clear descriptions.\n1. Tag a maintainer when you\'re done and ask for a review!\n\n[Click here for good first issues.](https://github.com/opentk/opentk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\n\n[Click here for everything we need help with.](https://github.com/opentk/opentk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n- Windows (7/8,10), Linux, Mac OS X, *BSD, SteamOS, Android or iOS\n- For graphics, OpenGL drivers or a suitable emulator, such as [ANGLE](https://github.com/opentk/opentk/tree/develop/Dependencies/Readme.txt)\n- For audio, OpenAL drivers or OpenAL Soft\n- To develop desktop applications: Visual Studio, Rider, or the command line tools.\n- To develop Android applications: Visual Studio and Xamarin\n- To develop iOS applications: Visual Studio, Xamarin and XCode\n\n\nKnown issues\n============\n\n1. The SDL2 backend has a number of limitations compared to the native platform backends. In particular, SDL2 does not support:\n   - `OpenTK.GLControl`. OpenTK will automatically switch to a native platform backend instead.\n   - `DisplayDevice.ChangeResolution()` without a fullscreen `INativeWindow`.\n   - Switching between `WindowBorder.Fixed` and `WindowBorder.Resizable`.\n   - High-resolution mouse input. Additionally, it is limited to a single keyboard and mouse device.\n2. OpenTK.Input.GamePad.SetVibration is currently not implemented. This API will be implemented in a future release.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nAPI Documentation is available on the [official website](https://opentk.net) or inline from favourite IDE.\n\nYou can also browse the full API on the official website\n\nAdditional information can be found in the [OpenTK Manual](http://web.archive.org/web/20150325224427/http://www.opentk.com/doc).\n\nTechnical documentation about the implementation of OpenTK can be found in the [Technical Wiki](https://github.com/opentk/opentk/wiki).\n\n\n\nNeed Help?\n==========\n\nCome chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6HqD48s).\n\nWe\'re happy to help with anything from learning OpenGL to advanced OpenTK questions.\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nThe Open Toolkit is distributed under the permissive MIT/X11 license and is absolutely free.\n'
