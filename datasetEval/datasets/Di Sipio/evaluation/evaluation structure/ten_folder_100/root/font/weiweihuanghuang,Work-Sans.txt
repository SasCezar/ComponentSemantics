The core of the fonts are optimised for on-screen medium-sized text usage (14px-48px) \xe2\x80\x93 but still can be used in print well. The fonts at the extreme weights are designed more for display use. Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen resolutions \xe2\x80\x93 for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they would be in print.\n\nThe fonts under **/fonts/static/OTF** are OTF fonts for desktop programs such as the Adobe Suite or Office (Office fonts are only styled linked for Regular and Bold). The metrics are set so that they are more consistent across desktop programs.\n\nThe fonts under **/fonts/static/TTF**, **/fonts/static/WOFF**, **/fonts/static/WOFF2** contain formats for web use. They have been autohinted with ttfautohint.\n\nThe fonts under **/fonts/variable** are variable TTF fonts.\n\nThis typeface was funded by Google and is distributed by Google Fonts \xe2\x80\x93 many thanks to Dave Crossland for the commission.\n\nPlease see BUILD.md for build instructions.\n\n### [Web specimen](http://weiweihuanghuang.github.io/Work-Sans/).\n\n### [Print PDF Specimen](documentation/Work-Sans-Print-Specimen.pdf?raw=true).\n\n## Suggestion, Comments, Contributions\nIf you spot any errors or have any suggestions for improvements you can fork this project, create an [Issue](../../issues) or email me at <a href="mailto:wweeiihhuuaanngg@gmail.com">wweeiihhuuaanngg@gmail.com</a>.\n\n## Notes\nThe project started in June 2014 and the brief was to have a [minimum viable product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (alpha release with 9 weights) by December 2014. Work Sans was first available on Google fonts in July 2015.\n\n## All the Thanks\nHjerteleg tusen takk til Tone Sj\xc3\xa5stad for her suport, patience, encouragement and inspiration throughout the process. \n\nMany thanks to the following who provided valuable feedback and encouragement:\nMathieu Cannavo, Vincent Chan, Greg Gazdowicz, Jack Jennings, Seb McLauchlan, Dan Milne, Scott Rankin, Dan Reynolds, David Jonathan Ross, Adam Twardoch, David Wise. \n\nThanks to the following people for their assitance and contributions:\n\n[CrystalType](https://github.com/crystaltype)\n\n[Dennis Grauel](https://dennisgrauel.com/)\n\n[Denis Moyogo Jacquerye](https://github.com/moyogo)\n\n[Stephen Nixon](http://www.thundernixon.com/)\n\n[Desmond Wong](http://desmondwong.com/)\n\n[Kia Tasbihgou](http://www.kiatas.me/)\n\nThanks to Simon Egli for inviting me to work together on Metapolator in the first place.\n\nThanks to everyone who was in my pocket the whole time.\n\n## License\nWork Sans is licensed under the SIL Open Font License v1.1 (<http://scripts.sil.org/OFL>)\n\nTo view the copyright and specific terms and conditions please refer to [OFL.txt](OFL.txt).'
