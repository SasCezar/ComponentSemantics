b'\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://jam-icons.com/static/img/logo.svg">\n</p>\n\nJam icons is a set of icons designed for web projects, illustrations, print projects, etc. Shipped in JavaScript, font &amp; SVG versions. Licensed under MIT.\nIcons: [https://jam-icons.com](https://jam-icons.com)\n\n## What\'s new?\n\nJam Icons v2 is a totally new version of this icons set. Read more below, especially if you are using the first version.\nEach icon has been re-shaped with a 2px stroke on a 24x24 grid. I mainly used a 20x20 grid, letting 4px for extra design.\nRecreating the entire set was huge, but needed. I wanted the set to be more reliable, more consistent, and bigger.\n\n\n## Getting Started\nThis version is shipped in three formats: JavaScript, SVG and font and contains more than 890 icons.\n### Javascript\n#### Usage\nThe recommended approach. It turns your tag into a clean svg markup. You just have to use the `data-jam` attribute inside a `span` or a `whatever` tag to select your icon (The attributes are listed below). So if you write:\n```html\n<span class="your-custom-class" data-jam="backpack" data-fill="#222"></span>\n```\n\nIt becomes:\n```html\n<svg class="jam jam-backpack your-custom-class" data-fill="#222">[...]</svg>\n```\n\n\n#### Install\n##### Via CDN (recommended)\n\n```html\n<script src="https://unpkg.com/jam-icons/js/jam.min.js"></script>\n```\n##### Via NPM\n\n```\n$ npm install jam-icons\n```\n##### Manually\nJust hit the **download** button and use a `script` tag like below:\n```html\n<script src="/path/to/js/jam.min.js"></script>\n```\n\n\n#### Attributes\n\n`data-jam` (required) *The icon you want to use, e.g `data-jam="backpack"`*\n\n`data-fill` (optional) *RGB or Hexadecimal, e.g `data-fill="#F5C25A"`*\n\n`data-width` (optional) *Integer, e.g `data-width="32"`*\n\n`data-height` (optional) *Integer, e.g `data-height="32"`*\n\n\n#### More infos\n\nYou can easily customize your icons using css, such as width, height and color. I provided the `data-fill`, `data-width` and `data-height` attributes to support a direct way to color the icon, in the case you do not want to add extra lines of css.\n\n\n### CSS / Font\n\n#### Usage\nThe alternative approach. You load the CSS stylesheet and use Jam icons as a font icons. You just have to use the `jam` class followed by the name of the icon you want to use prefixed by `jam-`, like below:\n```html\n<span class="jam jam-backpack"></span>\n```\n#### Install\n##### Via CDN (recommended)\n```html\n<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/jam-icons/css/jam.min.css">\n```\n##### Via NPM\n```\n$ npm install jam-icons\n```\n##### Manually\nJust hit the **download** button and use a `link` tag like below:\n```html\n<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/css/jam.min.css">\n```\n\n\n### SVGS\n#### Usage\nThe complete set as independents SVGs files is available too.\nHit the **download** button to download it.\n\n\n## Complete icons list\nYou can see the complete icons list on [https://jam-icons.com](https://jam-icons.com)\n\n## Support\nIf you have some icons ideas, please open a new **issue**, add a `icons-request` label and make your proposal.\nLikewise, if you see a bug or something that needs to be fixed, please open a new **issue** too with a `bug` label.\n\n## Compatibility\n#### Version 1.X.X\nUnfortunately, the v2 is a major version including major breaking changes: I kept the icons names availables in the v1 but the shapes are totally new.
