b'[Jost*](http://indestructible-type.github.io/Jost.html)\n========\n![Jost* Picture](https://indestructibletype.com/assets/Jost-h.svg)\nJost* is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired by \nthe designs of Paul Renner. This is version 3.4.\n\nJost* is designed and maintained by [Owen Earl](https://ewonrael.github.io/), who is the creator of the font foundry [indestructible type*](http://indestructible-type.github.io).\n\nAbout\n-----\nJost* is a font for the digital age. It\'s based off of the work of Paul Renner, the designer of Futura. \nJost* is an origonal font that aims to keep the attitude of Futura rather than the exact design. Futura \nwas designed to be functional in its day and in that spirit, Jost* aims to be as functional as possible \nin the digital era. For that reason it deviates from the exact designs of Paul Renner, favoring, for example, \na larger x-height. It also includes features, many of which would not be possible in the era of Paul Renner.\nJost* has 9 weights, ranging from Hairline to Black. It can support many languages, includes stylistic \nalternatives, and both tabular and proportional numbers. Using Jost* on the web is as easy as copying a \nline of code into your webpage and includes automatic updates. As of version 3.0, Jost* supports OpenType \nVariable Font technology that allows users to control the exact weight and italic of the font. Best of all\nJost* is still being actively developed meaning it will continue to improve and future updates may include \nfeatures requested by you!

However, because of the difficulty \nassociated with creating the OpenType Variable Font features, the compliled, functoning version of this font \nrequires a payment of $10 or more on the website. However, if you\'d like to build this font yourself using \nthe source code, the follow the following instructions.\n\nDownload the complete source code, either by cloning this repository or downloading the .zip file.\n\nDownload and install fontmake which can be found [here](https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake).\n\nNavigate to the "Variable Font Files" folder and run `fontmake -o variable -m jost.designspace`. This \nshould build the finished font file. If you have any questions don\'t look at me, I don\'t know what I\'m doing.\n\nContact\n-------\nIf you have questions or want to help out, send me and email at indestructibletype@gmail.com\n'
