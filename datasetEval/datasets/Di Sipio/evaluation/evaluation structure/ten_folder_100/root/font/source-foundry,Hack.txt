Check out our [gitter Hack channel](https://gitter.im/source-foundry/Hack).  Have a quick question that doesn\'t require an issue report?  Drop by our [gitter Help channel](https://gitter.im/source-foundry/Help) and ask away.\n\n### A typeface designed for source code\n\nHack is designed to be a workhorse typeface for source code. It has deep roots in the free, open source typeface community and expands upon the contributions of the [Bitstream Vera](https://www.gnome.org/fonts/) &amp; [DejaVu](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) projects.  The large x-height + wide aperture + low contrast design make it legible at commonly used source code text sizes with a sweet spot that runs in the 8 - 14 range.  The full set of changes to the upstream source are available in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).\n\nThe project is in active development, and we welcome your input and contributions.  You may view our design objectives and instructions on how to contribute in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nFrequently asked questions are answered in our [FAQ](FAQ.md).\n\n### Contents\n\n* [Features](#overview-of-features)\n* [Quick installation](#quick-installation)\n* [Package manager installation](#package-managers)\n* [Web font usage](#web-font-usage)\n* [Additional tools for font customization](#additional-tools-for-hack-font-customization)\n* [Resources](#resources)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n* [Build tools](#built-with)\n* [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments)\n* [License](#license)\n\n\n### Specimen\n\n<a href="http://source-foundry.github.io/Hack/font-specimen.html"><img src="img/hack-specimen-3-crunch.png" alt="Hack &mdash; a typeface designed for source code" width="728"></a>\n\n## Overview of features\n\n- **Typeface Name**: Hack\n- **Category**: Monospaced\n- **Character set support**: ASCII, Latin-1, Latin Extended A, Greek, Cyrillic\n- **Powerline Support**: Yes, included by default\n- **Included Styles**: Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic\n\n## Quick installation\n\n**NOTE ON FONT UPDATES**\n*If you are updating your version of Hack, be sure to remove the previously installed version and clear your font cache first to avoid conflicts that can lead to platform-specific rendering errors.  Many platforms/distros offer package managers that automate this process. We release a Windows installer to automate the install/update process on the Windows platform. See below for additional details.*\n\n### Linux\n\n1. Download the [latest version of Hack][ttf_latest].\n2. Extract the files from the archive (`.zip`).\n3. Copy the font files to either your system font folder (often `/usr/share/fonts/`) or user font folder (often `~/.local/share/fonts/` or `/usr/local/share/fonts`).\n4. Copy the font configuration file in `config/fontconfig/` to either the system font configuration folder (often `/etc/fonts/conf.d/`) or the font user folder (often `~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d`)\n5. Clear and regenerate your font cache and indexes with the following command:\n\n```\n$ fc-cache -f -v\n```\n\nYou can confirm that the fonts are installed with the following command:\n\n```\n$ fc-list | grep "Hack"\n```\n\nSome Linux users may find that font rendering is improved on their distro with [these instructions](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Improve_Font_Rendering).\n\n### macOS\n\n1. Download the [latest version of Hack][ttf_latest].\n2. Extract the files from the archive (`.zip`) and click to open them.\n3. Follow the instructions from your operating system.\n4. Enjoy!\n\n\n### Windows\n\n[![Hack Windows Installer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-Installer-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack-windows-installer/releases/latest)\n\nThe [Hack Windows Installer](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack-windows-installer/releases/latest) simplifies installation on the Windows platform.  The tool guides you through the installation process and addresses some common rendering issues that occur with font installs/updates on the Windows platform.  This tool is the recommended installation approach for Windows users.\n\n\n### Chrome/ChromeOS\n\nTo use with [Secure Shell](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo),\nedit the following fields in Options:\n\n  - font-family: `"Hack"`\n  - user-css: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hack-font@3/build/web/hack.css`\n\n## Package managers\n\nWe highly recommend the convenience of a community developed package manager or other auto-updating utility if this is available on your platform. While the package manager releases may be a bit delayed relative to the repository releases, the packages distributed through these package managers were designed to tune and automate font installs and updates on your system.\n\nWe are aware of Hack support in the following package managers (with associated package names):\n\n- **Arch Linux**: `ttf-hack`\n- **Chocolatey (Windows)**: `hackfont`\n- **Debian**: `fonts-hack-ttf`\n- **Fedora / CentOS**: `dnf-plugins-core :: heliocastro/hack-fonts :: hack-fonts`\n- **Gentoo Linux**: `media-fonts/hack`\n- **Homebrew Cask (OS X)**: `caskroom/fonts/font-hack`\n- **Open BSD**: `fonts/hack-fonts`\n- **OpenSUSE**: `hack-fonts`\n- **Ubuntu**: `fonts-hack-ttf`\n- **Visual Studio Package Manager**: `hack.font`\n\nFor installation issues with Hack packages, please contact the package maintainer directly.\n\n\n## Web font usage\n\nHack is available in the woff and woff2 web font formats. **Bold** and *italic* styles are included by default and work out-of-the-box via the `<strong>` and `<em>` tags.\n\nHack is available through the jsDelivr and cdnjs CDN services:\n\n[![jsDelivr](https://img.shields.io/badge/jsDelivr-Hack_web_font_CDN-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/hack-font)\n[![cdnjs](https://img.shields.io/badge/cdnjs-Hack_web_font_CDN-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/hack-font)\n\nThe following snippets provide examples of Hack web font use through the jsDelivr CDN.  Adjust the URL paths to those provided by cdnjs (click the link above to find the appropriate URL) to switch to the cdnjs CDN.\n\n#### 1. Add Hack to HTML\n\nInclude one of the following in the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML file:\n\n**Subset web fonts**\n\n```html\n<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hack-font@3/build/web/hack-subset.css">\n```\n\n**Full character set web fonts**\n\n```html\n<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hack-font@3/build/web/hack.css">\n```\n\n#### 2. Add Hack to CSS\n\n\n```css\npre, code { font-family: Hack, monospace; }\n```\n\nSee the [WEBFONT_USAGE.md](docs/WEBFONT_USAGE.md) documentation for additional details, including instructions on how to download, host, and serve the web fonts on your web server.\n\n## Additional tools for Hack font customization\n\n### Customize your build with alternate glyph styles\n\nThe [alt-hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/alt-hack) library includes a (growing) collection of alternate glyph styles that can be used to customize your Hack fonts.  Don\'t like the default zero style?  Swap out the UFO design source with a slashed zero or dotted zero and build new fonts that work better for you.\n\nWe welcome contributions of new alternate glyph styles in the alt-hack repository.  Design something new that works well with rest of the typeface and submit a pull request to the alt-hack repository so that others can use it in their custom builds.\n\nDetailed build instructions are available on the [alt-hack repository README.md](https://github.com/source-foundry/alt-hack).  Font renaming instructions to support side-by-side installs with upstream Hack are available below.\n\n### Line spacing adjustments\n\n[font-line](https://github.com/source-foundry/font-line) is a tool that modifies the default line spacing used in the Hack design (20% UPM).\n\nThe following gist installs font-line and modifies line spacing for all desktop font files contained in the same directory:\n\n- [linespace.sh](https://gist.github.com/chrissimpkins/f39e85f5f157d839e46168de1b61a174) ([download .zip](https://gist.github.com/chrissimpkins/f39e85f5f157d839e46168de1b61a174/archive/f3f93dea87d64ddc4684a61cbc96ddf79d30824a.zip))\n\n### Install modified and unmodified versions of Hack on the same system\n\nIf you modify the upstream Hack source or the released font binaries and would like to install your modified fonts on the same system with the Hack fonts as released here, you can use the [fontname.py Python script](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/fontname.py) to define a new font name in the binary files.  For example, you can install `Hack` on your platform along with a 15% UPM line spacing adjusted version as `Hack Fifteen`.  Modify default glyphs with those in our [alt-hack repository](https://github.com/source-foundry/alt-hack) or design your own and define your creation with any name that you\'d like.  Following installation, your renamed fonts should show under the name that you define with the script so that you can switch between any of them as you need.\n\nUsage details and examples are provided on the fontname.py repository README.\n\n\n## Resources\n* [Full specimen](http://source-foundry.github.io/Hack/font-specimen.html)\n* [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)\n* [Project website](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)\n* [Contributors](docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to Hack!
