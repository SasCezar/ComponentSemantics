b"Welcome to the Open Baskerville project.\n\nOpen Baskerville is an open source project to create a digital revival of the famous \xe2\x80\x98Baskerville\xe2\x80\x99 typefaces. To be more exact, Open Baskerville is based upon Fry\xe2\x80\x99s Baskerville, a Baskerville derivative created by Isaac Moore, a punchcutter who worked for John Baskerville.\n\nThe general information page for this project can be found at:\nhttp://klepas.org/openbaskerville\n\nThe issue tracker and message threads can be found at:\nhttp://openbaskerville.lighthouseapp.com\n\nThe source code repository can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/klepas/open-baskerville\n\n## About the Font Files ##\n\nThe UFO folders contain font source files. These are the files you edit if you want to contribute back to the project. You can not directly install UFO\xe2\x80\x99s on your system\xe2\x80\x94for that you need OTF files. You can generate the OTF files from the UFO either with a font editing program or by running the 'rake' command. Alternatively, you can download pre-built font files from the project website.\n\nFontForge supports UFO natively, as will the upcoming version of Fontlab. For Fontlab 5 you need to install the RoboFab scripting library. The RoboFab site provides detailed instructions: http://www.robofab.org\n\n## License ##\n\nThe Open Baskerville font files are dual-licensed under the GNU GPL version 3 (GNU General Public License) and the SIL Open Font License (OFL).
