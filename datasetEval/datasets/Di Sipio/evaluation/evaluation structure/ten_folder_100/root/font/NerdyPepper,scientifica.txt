b"![heroimage.png](https://0x0.st/scCW.png)\n\n# Scientifica\n\n![deets.png](./img/sci0.png)\n\nTall and condensed bitmap font for geeks.  \n\nScientifica is largely based on [creep](https://github.com/romeovs/creep), with a number\nof minor tweaks to improve readablity (*a matter of taste of course*).\n\nMost characters are just 4px wide, which is brilliant for low dpi(90-120) displays.\n\n\n## What's different?\n\n\nScientifica has a **bold** and an **italic** variant.\n\nHere are a few characters that recieved a revamp:\n\n`V, *, f, W, M, ~, & , i, t, a, (), [], {}`\n\nI have also added characters to the following unicode blocks:\n\n - Geometric Shapes\n - Arrows\n - Miscellaneous Technical\n - Miscellaneous Symbols\n - Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-A\n - Private Use Area\n - Mathematical Operators\n - Box Drawings\n\nI will be constantly adding glyphs to this font. **Keep a lookout.**\n\n\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Dark background\n\nScientifica in the wild:\n\n![preview.png](./img/sci4.png)\n\n\nScientifica now has most box drawing glyphs as well!\n\n![tree.png](./img/sci2.png)\n\n\nLatin, Polish, Solvakian, French, German accents included!\n\n![polski.png](./img/sci3.png)\n\n\nPowerline glyphs\n\n![powerline.png](./img/sci1.png)\n\n\nUnicode Python:\n\n![scientificapyligs.png](https://0x0.st/scvt.png)\n\n\nUnicode C++ (Ligatures included)\n\n![scientificaligs.png](https://0x0.st/scv4.png)\n\n\n*Please read [this](./ligature_plugins/README.md) for instructions on ligatures.*\n\n### Light background\n\n\nYou're kidding me right?\n\n\n## Installation\n\n\n### Linux\n\n\n 1. Enable bitmap fonts\n ```shell\n cd /etc/fonts/conf.d/\n sudo rm /etc/fonts/conf.d/10* && sudo rm -rf 70-no-bitmaps.conf && sudo ln -s ../conf.avail/70-yes-bitmaps.conf\n sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig\n  ```\n\n 2. Get Scientifica\n ```shell\n cd ~ \n git clone https://github.com/nerdypepper/scientifica --depth 1\n ```\n\n 3. Symlink it to the right folder\n ```shell\nln -fs ~/scientifica/regular/scientifica-11.bdf ~/.local/share/fonts/scientifica-11.bdf\nln -fs ~/scientifica/bold/scientificaBold-11.bdf ~/.local/share/fonts/scientificaBold-11.bdf\n ```\n\n 4. Use it. `rxvt` for example:\n\n ``` ini\nURxvt.font:xft:scientifica:size=11\nURxvt.font:xft:scientifica:size=22  !for the doubled variant\n ```\n\n\n### MacOS\n\n\n 1. Get Scientifica\n ```shell\n cd ~\n git clone https://github.com/nerdypepper/scientifica --depth 1\n ```\n\n 2. Open the `.dfont` in the Font Book.app  \n(This may not always be up to date. Try downloading the `.bdf` and exporting it to `.dfont` through fontforge)\n\n 3. You are done, I guess ... dont have a Mac to test it out.\n\n 4. Submit an issue in case you face any problems, or a pull request if you would like to correct me.\n\n\n\n## TODO\n\nFollowing agenda *may* be followed:\n\n - Add Control Pictures\n - ~~Add all mathematical operators~~ (Almost) Done!\n - ~~Get scientifica to work on windows~~ Done!\n - ~~Work on a bold version (Probably never)~~ Done!\n - Add variants for `a, i, l, 1` etc.\n\n\n\n## Credits\n\nMost Basic Latin characters are from [creep](https://github.com/romeovs/creep) by [romeovs](https://github.com/romeovs/).\n\nCreep has been optimized for linux terminals by [raymond-w-ko](https://github.com/raymond-w-ko/). Check out his version [here](https://github.com/raymond-w-ko/creep2).\n\nSome characters are based on [Lemon](http://artwizaleczapka.sourceforge.net/).\n\nThanks to the creators of [Font Forge](https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/) for, well, creating fontforge.\n"
