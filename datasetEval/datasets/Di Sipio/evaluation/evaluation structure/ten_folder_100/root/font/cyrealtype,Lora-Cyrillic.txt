b'### Lora Fonts\n\n#### by Olga Karpushina \nand Lora project authors\n\nLora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text. A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs. The overall typographic voice of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a modern-day story, or an art essay.\n\nTechnically Lora is optimised for screen appearance, and works equally well in print.\n\nDesigned by Olga Karpushina, and Alexei Vanyashin for Cyreal.\n\n![Lora Font](sources/sample.png "Lora Font by Cyreal")\n\nLora is a Unicode typeface family that supports \nlanguages that use the Latin and Cyrillic scripts and its variants, and \ncould be expanded to support other scripts.\n\n![Lora Font](sources/sample2.png "Lora Font by Cyreal")\n\nProject [information](http://www.cyreal.org/2012/07/lora/) on Cyreal Fonts\' website:\n\n### Variable Fonts\n[Version 2.202](https://github.com/cyrealtype/Lora-Cyrillic/releases/tag/v2.202)\nincludes a variable font version with one weight axis.\n\n### Cyrillic \n\nCyrillic Extension designed by Alexei Vanyashin @alexeiva in May, 2013. \n\n### GF Cyrillic Plus, Pro, and locl.\n\nExpansion to GF Cyrillic Plus, Pro, and locl has been completed by original author Olga Karpushina in August-September 2016.\n\n### Vietnamese\n\nVietnamese glyphs were added by Nhung Nguyen @crystaltype\n\n### License\n\nThis Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.\nThis license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/OFL\n'
