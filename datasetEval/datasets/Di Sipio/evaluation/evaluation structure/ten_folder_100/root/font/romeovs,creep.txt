b'\n![Creep](screens/logo.png "Creep logo")\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Features](#features) \xc2\xb7 [Installation](#installation) \xc2\xb7 [Attribution](#attribution) \xc2\xb7\n[Licence](#license)\n\nI never found the pixel font that was perfect for me, so I decided to roll\nmy own with creep.  It is a pretty compact (only 4px wide!) font that\'s great\nfor smaller screens (like my 11" laptop).\n\nI\'m constantly adding in new characters (diacritics, box-drawing characters, etc.),\nso I figured I\'d put it up on github for poeple to reap benefits of this.\n\nI also recently added some nice [Haskell features](https://github.com/romeovs/creep/wiki/Haskell-syntax-sugar) (that\ncan be used in other languages too)!\n\n![screenshot1](screens/screen.png  "screenshot of the ASCII characters")\n![screenshot2](screens/screen2.png "in the wild example")\n\n### Features\n[Box Drawing](#box-drawing) \xc2\xb7 [Sparklines](#sparklines) \xc2\xb7\n[Haskell](#better-haskell-syntax) \xc2\xb7 [Braille and\nDrawille](#braille-and-drawille)\n#### Box drawing\nCreep has most of the basic box drawing characters implemented.  Therefore creep\nusually works with most ncurses-type programs or with tmux window-splitting for\nexample.\n\n![box drawing](screens/box.png "boxdrawing screenshot")\n\n#### Powerline\nCreep supports all the symbols needed for Lokaltog\'s awesome [powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline) plugin\nfor vim:\n\n![powerline](screens/powerline.png "powerline screenshot")\n\n#### Sparklines\nCreep has the necessary symbols for creating sparklines. This is cool\nfor tools like [rainbarf](https://github.com/creaktive/rainbarf) and others.\nI mean, see how good it makes [iStats](https://github.com/Chris911/iStats) look:\n\n![istats](screens/istats.png "istats screenshot")\n\n#### Better Haskell syntax\nI\'ve added support for a better-looking Haskell syntax.  Take a look at [the Haskell wiki\npage](https://github.com/romeovs/creep/wiki/Haskell-syntax-sugar) to get an idea\nof how it looks and how to use it in vim.\n\n#### Braille and Drawille\nCreep now supports the full\n[braille alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_Patterns_(Unicode)),\nwhich was an easy thing to do because of the clever braille encoding scheme.\nAll of the braille characters are simply generated using a little script.\n\nBecause creep supports braille, it also supports the wonderful\n[Drawille](https://github.com/asciimoo/drawille) libraries:\n\n![drawille](screens/drawille.png "drawille screenshot")\n\n## Installation\nThe font is maintained using the awesome [gbdfed](http://sofia.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/Software/gbdfed/) \nwhich unfortunatly does not support a lot of export formats besides `bdf`.\n\nTo install creep in Mac OS X, you can use [font forge](http://fontforge.org/) to convert the `bdf`\nfile to a `dfont` file that can be used by Font Book.app to install the font.  To do this:\n\n1. open the font in font forge:\n\n   ```shell\n   $ fontforge creep.bdf\n   ```\n2. select `File > Generate Fonts`\n3. from the left dropdown select `No Outline Font`\n4. from the right dropdown select `Apple bitmap only sfnt (dfont)`\n5. click `Save`\n6. open the `.dfont` file in Font Book.app\n7. You\'re done!\n\nAlternativatly you can download one of the [releases](https://github.com/romeovs/creep/releases),\nthese are not the latest versions of the font but I will try to update them regulary so you don\'t\nhave to go trought these steps.\n\nI\'m not a professional font creator so there are some little quirks in the character\nsizing.  To get past these I set the line height to 0.9 and the character spacing\nto 0.75 in Terminal.app (using a Size of 16px) to make it look airtight.\n\n![terminal](screens/info.png "Terminal.app settings")\n\n## Attribution\nBefore I created creep I was using [Proggy Tiny](http://www.proggyfonts.net/), which is also \ngreat font and has given me the inspiration to create my own font.\n\nAlso I would like to compliment the creators of\n[gbdfed](http://www.math.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/Software/gbdfed/) on their work.  I\nreally enjoy using it.\n\nAlso if you have some ideas on what I should implement, please contact me.  I\'d\nbe happy to implement extra features.\n\nThanks go out to [Chase Colman](https://github.com/chase) for fixing the\nmetric issues creep had, a wercker script and just for being a helpful fellow.\n\n[Creepin\'](https://soundcloud.com/youngmustard/creepin-no-sleep-remasterd)\n\n## License\nI love you all, so please use this font as much as you like for free.  However, I would like to make sure\nyou provide others the same liberty in creep\'s new incarnations.
