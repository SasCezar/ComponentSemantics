b'# Playfair Display\n\n## An Open Source typeface family for display and titling use\n\n![Playfair Display specimen](https://rawgithub.com/clauseggers/playfair-Display/master/Images/Playfair-Display-A4-specimen.svg)\n\nPlay\xc2\xadfair is a trans\xc2\xaditional design. From the time of enlight\xc2\xaden\xc2\xadment in the late 18th cen\xc2\xadtury, the broad nib quills were replaced by poin\xc2\xadted steel pens. This influ\xc2\xadenced typo\xc2\xadgraph\xc2\xadical let\xc2\xadter\xc2\xadforms to become increas\xc2\xadingly detached from the writ\xc2\xadten ones. Devel\xc2\xadop\xc2\xadments in print\xc2\xading tech\xc2\xadno\xc2\xadlogy, ink and paper mak\xc2\xading, made it pos\xc2\xadsible to print let\xc2\xadter\xc2\xadforms of high con\xc2\xadtrast and del\xc2\xadic\xc2\xadate hairlines.\n\nThis design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any par\xc2\xadtic\xc2\xadu\xc2\xadlar design, it takes influ\xc2\xadence from the designs of printer and typeface designer John Bask\xc2\xaderville, the punch\xc2\xadcut\xc2\xadter Wil\xc2\xadliam Martin\xe2\x80\x99s typeface for the \xe2\x80\x98Boy\xc2\xaddell Shak\xc2\xadspeare\xe2\x80\x99 (sic) edi\xc2\xadtion, and from the \xe2\x80\x98Scotch Roman\xe2\x80\x99 designs that fol\xc2\xadlowed thereafter.\n\nAs the name indic\xc2\xadates, Play\xc2\xadfair Dis\xc2\xadplay is well suited for titling and head\xc2\xadlines. It has an extra large x-height and short des\xc2\xadcend\xc2\xaders. It can be set with no lead\xc2\xading if space is tight, for instance in news head\xc2\xadlines, or for styl\xc2\xadistic effect in titles. Cap\xc2\xadit\xc2\xadals are extra short, and only very slightly heav\xc2\xadier than the lower\xc2\xadcase char\xc2\xadac\xc2\xadters. This helps achieve a more even typo\xc2\xadgraph\xc2\xadical col\xc2\xadour when type\xc2\xadset\xc2\xadting proper nouns and ini\xc2\xadtial\xc2\xadisms. Lan\xc2\xadguages, like Ger\xc2\xadman, where nouns are cap\xc2\xadit\xc2\xadal\xc2\xadized, par\xc2\xadtic\xc2\xadu\xc2\xadlarly bene\xc2\xadfit from this lower con\xc2\xadtrast between lower and upper case glyphs. In Ger\xc2\xadman, with its many cap\xc2\xadit\xc2\xadal\xc2\xadized words, and other European lan\xc2\xadguages that use many dia\xc2\xadcrit\xc2\xadical char\xc2\xadac\xc2\xadters, it is advised to use more leading.\n\nBeing a trans\xc2\xaditional design, styl\xc2\xadist\xc2\xadic\xc2\xadally Play\xc2\xadfair can accom\xc2\xadpany Geor\xc2\xadgia, where Geor\xc2\xadgia is used for body text.\n\nPlay\xc2\xadfair includes a full set of small-caps, com\xc2\xadmon lig\xc2\xadat\xc2\xadures, and dis\xc2\xadcre\xc2\xadtion\xc2\xadary lig\xc2\xadat\xc2\xadures. For Pol\xc2\xadish, a set of altern\xc2\xadate dia\xc2\xadcrit\xc2\xadical char\xc2\xadac\xc2\xadters designed with \xe2\x80\x98kreska\xe2\x80\x99s are included. All European lan\xc2\xadguages using the latin script are sup\xc2\xadpor\xc2\xadted. A set of eight arrow devices are also included.\n\nPlay\xc2\xadfair Dis\xc2\xadplay also cover the cyril\xc2\xadlic glyphs used in Bul\xc2\xadgarian, Belarus\xc2\xadian, Rus\xc2\xadsian, Bosnian/Serbian (includ\xc2\xading Ser\xc2\xadbian mor\xc2\xadpho\xc2\xadlogy for \xd0\xb1), and Ukrainian.\n\nPlay\xc2\xadfair Dis\xc2\xadplay comes in three weights and two styles, includ\xc2\xading small-caps for all weights and styles \xe2\x80\x93 also for the cyrillic.\n\nGo to **[Google Web\xc2\xadfonts to use Play\xc2\xadfair Dis\xc2\xadplay as a web\xc2\xadfont](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Playfair+Display)**. Spe\xc2\xadcial fonts con\xc2\xadtain\xc2\xading small-cap glyphs in the place of the lower\xc2\xadcase glyphs have also been put on Google Web\xc2\xadfonts. Use these fonts for true small-caps in browsers without Open\xc2\xadType cap\xc2\xadab\xc2\xadil\xc2\xadit\xc2\xadies. You do not need to down\xc2\xadload these fonts as the small-caps are already in Play\xc2\xadfair Dis\xc2\xadplay proper.\n\nPlay\xc2\xadfair Dis\xc2\xadplay is pub\xc2\xadlished under the [SIL Open Font License Version 1.1](https://github.com/clauseggers/Playfair-Display/blob/master/OFL.txt), grant\xc2\xading you license to use the fonts free of charge, and enables you to extend & modify the fam\xc2\xadily should you wish to.
