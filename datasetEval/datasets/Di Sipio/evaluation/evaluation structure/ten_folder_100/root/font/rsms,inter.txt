b'# Inter\n\nInter is a typeface specially designed for user interfaces\nwith focus on high legibility of small-to-medium sized text on computer screens.\n\nThe family features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and\nlower-case text. Several OpenType features are provided as well,\nlike contextual alternates that adjusts punctuation depending on the shape of\nsurrounding glyphs, slashed zero for when you need to disambiguate "0" from "o",\ntabular numbers, etc.\n\n[![Sample](docs/res/sample.png)](https://rsms.me/inter/samples/)\n\n### [\xe2\xac\x87\xef\xb8\x8e Download the latest release](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/latest)\n\nAfter downloading the zip from above:\n\n1.

Some trade-offs were made in order to make this typeface work really well at small sizes:\n\n- Currently not suitable for very large sizes because of some small-scale glyph optimizations (like "pits" and "traps") that help rasterization at small sizes but stand out and interfere at large sizes.\n- Rasterized at sizes below 12px, some stems\xe2\x80\x94like the horizontal center of "E", "F", or vertical center of "m"\xe2\x80\x94are drawn with two semi-opaque pixels instead of one solid. This is because we "prioritize" (optimize for) higher-density rasterizations. If we move these stems to an off-center position\xe2\x80\x94so that they can be drawn sharply at e.g. 11px\xe2\x80\x94text will be less legible at higher resolutions.\n\nCurrent font styles:\n\n| Name                 | Weight class\n| -------------------- | ----------------\n| Thin                 | 100\n| Thin Italic          | 100\n| Extra Light          | 200\n| Extra Light Italic   | 200\n| Light                | 300\n| Light Italic         | 300\n| Regular              | 400\n| Italic               | 400\n| Medium               | 500\n| Medium Italic        | 500\n| Semi Bold            | 600\n| Semi Bold Italic     | 600\n| Bold                 | 700\n| Bold Italic          | 700\n| Extra Bold           | 800\n| Extra Bold Italic    | 800\n| Black                | 900\n| Black Italic         | 900\n\nInter also ships as a variable font.\n\n\n### Font metrics\n\nThis font was originally designed to work at a specific size: 11px. Thus, the Units per [EM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)) (UPM) is defined in such a way that a power-of-two multiple of one EM unit ends up at an integer value compared to a pixel. Most fonts are designed with a UPM of either 1000 or 2048. Because of this we picked a value that is as high as possible but also as close as possible to one of those common values (since it\'s reasonable to assume that some layout engines and rasterizers are optimized for those value magnitudes.) We ended up picking a UPM of 2816 which equates to exactly 256 units per pixel when rasterized for size 11pt at 1x scale. This also means that when rasterized at power-of-two scales (like 2x and 4x) the number of EM units corresponding to a pixel is an integer (128 units for 2x, 64 for 4x, and so on.)\n\nHowever, as the project progressed and the typeface was put into use, it quickly\nbecame clear that for anything longer than a short word, it was actually hard to\nread the almost monotonically-spaced letters.\n\nA second major revision was created where the previously-strict rule of geometry being even multiples of 256 was relaxed and now the rule is "try to stick with 128x, if you can\'t, stick with 64x and if you can\'t do that either, never go below 16x." This means that Inter is now much more variable in pace than it used to be, making it work better at higher resolutions and work much better in longer text, but losing some contrast and sharpness at small sizes.\n\n![Metrics](docs/res/metrics.png)\n\nThe glyphs are designed based on this "plan"; most stems and lines will be positioned at EM units that are even multiples of 128, and in a few cases they are at even multiples of 64 or as low as 16.\n\nMetrics:\n\n- UPM:        2816\n- Descender:  -640\n- x-height:   1536\n- Cap height: 2048\n- Ascender:   2688\n\nTranslating between EM units and pixels:\n\n- Rasterized at 11px: 1px = 256 units\n- Rasterized at 22px: 1px = 128 units\n- Rasterized at 44px: 1px =  64 units\n\nThere\'s a Figma workspace for glyphs, with configured metrics: ["Inter glyphs"](https://www.figma.com/file/RtScFU5NETY3j9E0yOmnW4gv/)\n\n\n## Development\n\nFor instructions on how to work with the source files and how to\n[compile & build font files](CONTRIBUTING.md#compiling-font-files),\nrefer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nInter is licensed under the [SIL Open Font License](LICENSE.txt)\n'
