b'# Bungee\n\nIn the crowded urban environment, space for signage is always at a premium. From dumpy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signs have nowhere to go but up. Bungee is a font family that celebrates urban signage by wrangling the Latin alphabet to work vertically as well as horizontally; with separately glyphs, spacing, and kerning for each orientation. Bungee comes equipped with chromatic inlines, outlines, shades, and ornaments, making it the perfect toolkit to take your text in a new direction.\n\nLearn more about Bungee at [djr.com/bungee](https://djr.com/bungee).\n\n## Specimen\n\n![Bungee Specimen](specimen.png)\n\n## Family structure\n\nBungee contains several different font sets that allow access to the chromatic layers and vertical forms. \n\nThe basic *Bungee* family includes Regular and Hairline weights, as well as three composite layerings: Inline, Outline, and Shade.\n\n*Bungee Layers* contains each layer in a separate font, which can be used in combination to create chromatic text.\n\n*Bungee Layers Rotated* implements Bungee\xe2\x80\x99s vertical forms by default, with all characters rotated 90\xc2\xb0 counterclockwise. These fonts can be set in a textbox rotated 90\xc2\xb0 clockwise to simulate vertical type.\n\n*Bungee Color* contains experiments with the various color font formats out there, including SVG, COLR/CPAL and sbix. None of these formats are widely supported (yet!), so your milage may vary. These fonts are built with Jens Kut\xc3\xadlek\xe2\x80\x99s [RoboChrome](https://github.com/fontfont/RoboChrome), and produced with help from [Roel Nieskens](https://pixelambacht.nl).\n\n[Check out the docs](/documentation) to learn more about how to use Bungee\xe2\x80\x99s chromatic layers, vertical forms, stylistic alternates, and ornaments.\n\nBungee was designed in [RoboFont](http://www.robofont.com) and its drawing and build sources are available in [UFO format](http://www.unifiedfontobject.org).\n\n![Another Bungee Specimen](specimen2.png)\n\n## License\n\nThanks to support from Google and The Font Bureau, Bungee is released under the SIL Open Font License.
