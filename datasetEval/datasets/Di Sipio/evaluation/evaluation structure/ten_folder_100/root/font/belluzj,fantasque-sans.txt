b'Fantasque Sans Mono\n===================\n\nA programming font, designed with functionality in mind, and with some\nwibbly-wobbly handwriting-like fuzziness that makes it unassumingly cool.\n[Download](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans/releases/latest) or \nsee [installation instructions](#installation).\n\n\n![](Specimen/urxvt13.png)\n\nPreviously known as *Cosmic Sans Neue Mono*. It\nappeared that [similar names were already in use for other\nfonts](https://github.com/belluzj/cosmic-sans-neue/issues/16), and that\npeople tended to extend their instinctive hatred of Comic Sans to this very\nfont of mine (which of course can only be *loved*). Why the previous name?\nHere is my original explanation:\n\n> The name comes from my realization that at some point it looked like the\n> mutant child of Comic Sans and Helvetica Neue. Hopefully it is not the\n> case any more.\n\nInspirational sources include Inconsolata and Monaco. I have also been using\nConsolas a lot in my programming life, so it may have some points in common.\n\n![](Specimen/kdevelop11.png)\n![](Specimen/sublime11.png)\n\nWeights, variants and glyph coverage\n------------------------------------\n\nThe font includes a bold version, with the same metrics as the regular one.\nBoth versions include the same ranges of characters : latin letters, some\naccented glyphs (quite a lot), some greek letters, some arrows.\n\nPlease note that I have not tested all of the glyphs I have drawn (some letters\nhave those two layers of crazy accents that I have never witnessed before), so\nit might look bad in some cases. Please report these problems: see next section.\n\nIt also features a good italic version, which I designed in a fashion similar\nto Consolas\' italic version, with new glyph designs, not just an added slant.\n\n![](Specimen/vim21.png)\n\nStylistic set(s)\n----------------\n\n### `ss01`: nondescript `k`\n\nNo ~~distractive~~ lovely loop.\n[Get the pre-activated version here](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans/releases/download/1.8.0/FantasqueSansMono-NoLoopK.zip)\nor see the [issue #67](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans/issues/67)\nfor techniques to activate the stylistic set.\n\n![](Specimen/noloopk.png)\n\nAuthor and license\n------------------\n\nCreated by Jany Belluz \\<jany.belluz AT hotmail.fr\\>\n\nLicensed under the SIL Open Font License (see [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt)).\n\nPlease send me an e-mail or [report an issue on\nGithub](http://github.com/belluzj/cosmic-sans-neue/issues) if you stumble upon\nbad design or rendering problems (with screen shot if possible), or if you need\nmore characters, or if you want to compliment me (I love compliments).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can [download the latest version](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans/releases/latest)\nand install it by hand. In the `NoLoopK` variant, the looped lowercase `k` is \nreplaced with a straight version. The `LargeLineHeight` variant is especially \nuseful for users of accented capitals. For more info, see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).\n\nAutomatic installation on macOS with [homebrew](https://brew.sh):\n\n    brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts #You only need to do this once for cask-fonts\n    brew cask install font-fantasque-sans-mono\n\nInstructions for other platforms might follow.\n\nBuilding installable font files\n-------------------------------\n\nThe build process requires:\n* FontForge with python scripting support,\n* `ttfautohint`\n* `sfnt2woff` (from the `woff-tools` package on Ubuntu)\n* `woff2_compress` from [the Google WOFF2\n  tools](https://github.com/google/woff2) or `woff2` package on Ubuntu\n\nRun `make`. You should see green stuff and some "OK" messages.\n\nIf you are using Ubuntu, please note that the FontForge version\nin the default Ubuntu repositories is much outdated at the time of this writing,\nand that [is known to have caused subtle problems](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans/issues/59).\nYou are advised to install FontForge from\n[this PPA](https://launchpad.net/~fontforge/+archive/ubuntu/fontforge)\n(using `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fontforge/fontforge` prior to the installation).\nAlternatively, you can always [download](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans/releases/latest)\nthe latest prebuilt release of these fonts.\n\n`make install` will install the TTF fonts into your local `.fonts/` directory\nand update the font cache. It comes in handy while modifying the font.\n\n[![](Specimen/Specimen.png)](Specimen/Specimen.pdf)\n\nWebfonts\n--------\n\nEach variant has a `Webfonts/` folder which contains various font formats for\nuse on the web, along with the matching CSS font declarations. To use them,\nyou must combine in the same folder:\n* a custom `.css` file that you can assemble from the `*-decl.css` fragments\n  (you can only pick the styles that you need, e.g. normal and bold)\n* the matching `.svg`, `.woff`, `.woff2` files from `Webfonts/`\n* the matching `.ttf` files from the `TTF/` folder\n* the matching `.otf` files from the `OTF/` folder.\n\nVersions\n--------\n\n[Check out the changelog](CHANGELOG.md).\n'
