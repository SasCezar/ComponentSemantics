Creates panes as necessary. Displays git changes if there is a repository found. | ... |\n| Disable `split-diff:disable` | Disables a diff. Removes any panes that were created by this package. | ... |\n| Set Ignore Whitespace `split-diff:set-ignore-whitespace` | Toggles the Ignore Whitespace setting. | ... |\n| Set Auto Diff `split-diff:set-auto-diff` | Toggles the Auto Diff setting. | ... |\n| Move to Next Diff `split-diff:next-diff` | Highlights the next difference.
