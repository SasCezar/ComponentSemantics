Cypht is not your\nfather\'s webmail. Unless you are one of my daughters, in which case it is your\nfather\'s webmail. Cypht is like a news reader, but for E-mail. Cypht does not\nreplace your existing accounts - it combines them into one. And it\'s also a\nnews reader.\n\n![screenshot](https://github.com/jasonmunro/cypht-website/blob/master/img/cypht_shot1.png "Unread View").\n\nThe driving force behind Cypht development is to provide combined views for\nmultiple accounts, but it\'s also a standard E-mail client that lets you browse\nand manage IMAP folders (or POP3 inboxes), and send outbound messages with\nSMTP.\n\nCypht is an application built entirely of plugins, or as we call them, module\nsets (which is obviously way cooler sounding than plugins), that are executed\nby the framework. Modules provide a flexible way to add new features or\ncustomize the program without hacking the code.\n\n\nInstallation instructions [https://cypht.org/install.html](https://cypht.org/install.html)\n\nSecurity details: [https://cypht.org/security.html](https://cypht.org/security.html)\n\nModule info: [https://cypht.org/modules.html](https://cypht.org/modules.html)\n\nFeatures: [https://cypht.org/features.html](https://cypht.org/features.html)\n\nLicense: [https://cypht.org/license.html](https://cypht.org/license.html)\n\nContact: [jason@cypht.org](mailto:jason@cypht.org)\n'
