This ensures your autocomplete suggestions are kept up to date.\n\n## Platforms\n\nThe package has CI for OS X, Windows and Ubuntu.\n\n## Installing Missing Tools\n\nIf you are missing any required tools, you may be prompted to install them. You can also manually install the required tools in your terminal:\n\n```\ngo get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports\ngo get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gorename\ngo get -u github.com/sqs/goreturns\ngo get -u github.com/mdempsky/gocode\ngo get -u github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter\ngo get -u github.com/mgechev/revive\ngo get -u github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint\ngo get -u github.com/zmb3/gogetdoc\ngo get -u github.com/zmb3/goaddimport\ngo get -u github.com/rogpeppe/godef\ngo get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru\ngo get -u github.com/fatih/gomodifytags\ngo get -u github.com/tpng/gopkgs\ngo get -u github.com/ramya-rao-a/go-outline\n```\n\n## Having Issues?\n\nPlease consult the [FAQ](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/wiki/FAQ) prior to [opening an issue](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/issues/new): https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/wiki/FAQ\n\nIf you have an issue with debugging, file an issue with [`go-debug`](https://github.com/lloiser/go-debug) [here](https://github.com/lloiser/go-debug/issues/new).\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- Joe Fitzgerald ([@joefitzgerald](https://github.com/joefitzgerald))\n- Zac Bergquist ([@zmb3](https://github.com/zmb3))\n- Lukas Beranek ([@lloiser](https://github.com/lloiser))\n\n## Contributors\n\nA list of contributors can be found at https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/graphs/contributors.
