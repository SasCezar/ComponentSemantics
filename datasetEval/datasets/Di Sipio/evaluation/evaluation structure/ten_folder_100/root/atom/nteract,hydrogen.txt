b'# Hydrogen <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/nteract/hydrogen/17eda245/static/animate-logo.svg" alt="hydrogen animated logo" height="50px" align="right" />\n\n[![slack in](https://slackin-nteract.now.sh/badge.svg)](https://slackin-nteract.now.sh)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nteract/hydrogen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nteract/hydrogen)\n\nHydrogen is an interactive coding environment that supports Python, R, JavaScript and [other Jupyter kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).\n\nCheckout our [Documentation](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/) and [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/nteract/hydrogen-interactive-computing-in-atom-89d291bcc4dd) to see what you can do with Hydrogen.\n\n![hero](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13285808/20360886/7e03e524-ac03-11e6-9176-37677f226619.gif)\n\n## Contents\n\n1.

[License](#license)\n\n## Background\n\nHydrogen was inspired by Bret Victor\'s ideas about the power of instantaneous feedback and the design of [Light Table](http://lighttable.com/). Running code inline and in real time is a more natural way to develop. By bringing the interactive style of Light Table to the rock-solid usability of Atom, Hydrogen makes it easy to write code the way you want to.\n\nYou also may be interested in our latest project \xe2\x80\x93 [nteract](https://github.com/nteract/nteract) \xe2\x80\x93 a desktop application that wraps up the best of the web based Jupyter notebook.\n\n## Features\n\n- execute a line, selection, or block at a time\n- rich media support for plots, images, and video\n- watch expressions let you keep track of variables and re-run snippets after every change\n- completions from the running kernel, just like autocomplete in the Chrome dev tools\n- code can be inspected to show useful information provided by the running kernel\n- one kernel per language (so you can run snippets from several files, all in the same namespace)\n- interrupt or restart the kernel if anything goes wrong\n- use a custom kernel connection (for example to run code inside Docker), read more in the "Custom kernel connection (inside Docker)" section\n\n## [Documentation](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/)\n\n- [Installation](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Installation.html)\n- [Usage](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Usage/GettingStarted.html)\n  - [Getting started](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Usage/GettingStarted.html)\n  - [Examples](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Usage/Examples.html)\n  - [Notebook Import and Export](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Usage/NotebookFiles.html)\n  - [Remote Kernels](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Usage/RemoteKernelConnection.html)\n- [Troubleshooting Guide](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Troubleshooting.html)\n- [Style Customization](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/StyleCustomization.html)\n- [Plugin API](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/PluginAPI.html)\n\n## Plugins for Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen has support for plugins. Feel free to add your own to the list:\n\n- [Hydrogen Launcher](https://github.com/lgeiger/hydrogen-launcher)\n- [hydrogen-python](https://github.com/nikitakit/hydrogen-python)\n- [Data Explorer](https://github.com/BenRussert/data-explorer)\n- [Cell Navigation](https://github.com/hoishing/cell-navigation)\n- [Hydrogen Cell Separator](https://github.com/jhabriel/hydrogen-cell-separator)\n\nIf you are interested in building a plugin take a look at our [plugin API documentation](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/PluginAPI.html).\n\n## How it works\n\nHydrogen implements the [messaging protocol](http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messaging.html) for [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Jupyter (formerly IPython) uses ZeroMQ to connect a client (like Hydrogen) to a running kernel (like IJulia or iTorch). The client sends code to be executed to the kernel, which runs it and sends back results.\n\n## Why "Hydrogen"?\n\nHydrogen atoms make up 90% of Jupiter by volume.\n\nPlus, it was easy to make a logo.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThanks for taking the time to contribute. Take a look at our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.\n\nThen, take a look at any issue labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) that has not been claimed.
