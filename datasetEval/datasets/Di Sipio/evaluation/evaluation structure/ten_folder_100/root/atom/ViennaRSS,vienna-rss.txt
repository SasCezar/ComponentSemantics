b"![Vienna](https://vienna-rss.sourceforge.io/img/vienna_logo.png)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss)\n[![Crowdin](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/vienna-rss/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/vienna-rss)\n[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/ViennaRSS/Lobby)\n\n[Vienna](http://www.vienna-rss.com) is an RSS/Atom reader for macOS.\n\nVienna can connect directly to the websites you want to track.\nAdditionally or alternatively, you can also sync with a server supporting the [Open Reader API](http://rss-sync.github.io/Open-Reader-API/rssconsensus/) (an adaptation of the now deceased Google Reader API). Vienna has been successfully tested with BazQux.com, FreshRSS.org, FeedHQ.org, InoReader.com and TheOldReader.com.\n\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nSince version 3.2, Vienna requires a minimum of OS X 10.9 (Mavericks).\n\nVienna 3.1.x requires a minimum of OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion).\nVienna 3.0.x requires a minimum of OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nAdmins upload release and test versions at [bintray](https://bintray.com/viennarss/vienna-rss/vienna-rss/) and [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vienna-rss/files/).  \nAlternatively, you can download releases from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss/releases).\n\n**Homebrew**\n\nVienna is also available as a Cask for [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask).\n```bash\nbrew cask install vienna\n```\n\nGetting support\n---------------\n\nIf the in-application help files and the [FAQs](http://www.vienna-rss.com/?page_id=96) don\xe2\x80\x99t answer your questions, head over to our [Support forum](https://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewforum.php?f=18) which is hosted by Cocoaforge.\n\nReporting an issue\n------------------\n\nIf after reading the forum and asking your questions there, you are convinced that there is a problem in Vienna's code or an important feature is missing, you may open an [issue](https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open) on Github.\n\nBe concise, but as precise as possible to allow other people reproducing the issue. To keep things short, you can provide a link to a relevant thread or message on the Cocoaforge forum.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nWant to contribute? Great! There are many ways you can, even if you aren't a developer.\n\n### Writing code\n\nPlease check [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nVienna now uses [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) for managing dependencies.\n\n### Localizing ###\n\nWe need help keeping Vienna translations up to date into different languages. You can contribute localizations at [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/vienna-rss). Registration is required, but the account is free. If you want to contribute for a language that is not yet listed, then contact us. Do not localize the project's \\*.strings files directly. Localizable \\*.plist files have to be localized directly.\n\n### Writing custom styles\n\nVienna supports a variety of different display styles for articles. These styles are provided on the Styles sub-menu off the View menu. A style is a combination of an HTML template that is used to control the placement of various parts of the article and a CSS stylesheet that controls the appearance of the article.\n\nYou can write styles by referring to [this document](http://www.vienna-rss.com/?page_id=65). Have a look at existing styles in the __Styles__ folder.\n\n### Writing plugins\n\nVienna supports plugins which are installed in menus and/or on the toolbar and can run defined actions. These plugins are XML-based and can be created by editing a simple .plist-file without any knowledge of Cocoa programming, in as little as 15 minutes.\n\nYou can write plugins by referring to [this document](http://www.vienna-rss.com/?page_id=120). Have a look at existing plugins in the __Plugins__ folder.\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\n[Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENCE.md).\n"
