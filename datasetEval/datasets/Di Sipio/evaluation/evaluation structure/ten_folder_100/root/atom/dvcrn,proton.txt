All you need to do is configure your `~/.proton` file \xe2\x80\x94 your central configuration point \xe2\x80\x94 and Proton will do the rest.\n\n##### :ok_hand: easy to remember keybindings\n\nNo one has time to remember a ton of keybindings and then learn another ton for a new tool. Proton leverages Spacemacs mnemonics in which each keybinding is assigned to a specific category:\n\n- <kbd>SPC g s</kbd> will execute [__g__]it [__s__]tatus\n- <kbd>SPC p t</kbd> will toggle the [__p__]rojects [__t__]ree-view\n\nYou get the idea!\n\n##### :mag: discoverable\n\nNo time to read through the docs? No problem. Proton is very easily discoverable through the keybindings helper. Just hit <kbd>SPC</kbd> and it will pop up:\n\n![keybinding-helper][5]\n\n##### :battery: batteries included\nAtom has __a ton__ of packages but only a subset of them are actually useful. Instead of finding all the good bits yourself, rely on a crowd-configured layer system that does it for you! Every bit of functionality of Proton is encapsulated in layers. Enable what you want and don\'t care about the rest.\n\nCheck out [all available layers here][4].\n\n##### :package: layer based configuration\nImagine you want to do some JavaScript in Atom but you have no idea what to install and what to set up. Instead of just installing random packages by yourself, you include the `:javascript` layer and boom! Proton installs all the good packages and configuration for you.\n\n\n\n### Install\n\nThere are 2 ways of installing Proton: You can compile the latest master (which should be fairly stable) or use the [apm-published](https://atom.io/packages/proton-mode) version.\n\n#### Pre-warning\nProton tries to be your unified configuration system. Please use a fresh Atom installation or backup your existing config as Proton will very likely __wipe your settings and packages__. Alternatively make sure your `~/.proton` file contains your current configuration or add `["proton.core.wipeUserConfigs" false]` to your `~/.proton`. The template is available for download [here](https://github.com/dvcrn/proton/blob/master/plugin/templates/proton.edn).\n\n#### Going full Proton\n\n```\napm install proton-mode\n```\n\nor through the package manager here: https://atom.io/packages/proton-mode\n\n### Compiling\n\n#### Requirements\n- atom / apm\n- [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)\n\n#### Running it\n\n```\nlein run -m build/release\n\n# or if you want auto-compile on change:\nlein run -m build/dev-repl\n```\nwill compile the ClojureScript code into JavaScript. Once that\'s done, go into the `plugin/` folder and run\n\n```\napm install\napm link\n```\n\nProton should now be installed inside Atom under `proton-mode`.\n\n### Help\n\nJoin us on the [clojurians slack](http://clojurians.net), channel #proton.\n\n### License\n\nGPLv3\n\n[1]: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/\n[2]: https://github.com/dvcrn/sublimious\n[3]: http://i.imgur.com/UmxjocD.gif\n[4]: https://github.com/dvcrn/proton/tree/master/src/cljs/proton/layers\n[5]: http://i.imgur.com/npGILXj.png\n'
