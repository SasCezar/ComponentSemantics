b'git-s3-push\n===========\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bobbo/git-s3-push.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bobbo/git-s3-push)\n[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/bobbo/git-s3-push)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/bobbo/git-s3-push)\n\n**git-s3-push** is a tool to deploy git repositories to AWS S3 buckets. **git-s3-push** keeps track of which commits have been pushed and supports deploying only recently modified files.\nIt can be used for deploying [static websites hosted on S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html), maintaining versioned bucket data or using S3 to backup git repositories.\n\n## Features\n- Simple method to deploy git repos to S3.\n- Fast uploads by only uploading new commits.\n- Automatically detects and sets the S3 content type of files.\n- Can automatically make your files publicly available (private by default).\n- Single binary, no [dependencies on language runtimes](https://github.com/schickling/git-s3).\n\n## Installation\n\nGrab a binary for your platform from the releases. Or check out the code, run `go get` and `go run git-s3-push.go`.\n\nGit must be installed on your path.\n\n## Usage\nAuthentication credentials are taken from the standard AWS environment variables. Bucket name and AWS region are supplied as arguments.\n\n```$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<...>```\n\n```$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<...>```\n\n```$ git-s3-push -b my-bucket-name -r aws-region-1 -save```\n\nThe `-save` flag stores the bucket name and region so you can push to the same location by just running:\n\n\n```$ git-s3-push```\n\nThe `-public` flag can be used to make the files uploaded to your bucket publicly readable. When running without the `-public` flag, pushed files are stored privately.\n\nAll usage options can be shown using the `-help` flag.\n\n## Config\nAfter using the `-save` flag, `git-s3-push` creates a JSON configuration file (`.git_s3_push`) storing bucket and region information. This file also includes other configuration directives that cannot be specified using flags:\n\n- `Ignore`: Files in the git repo that *should not* be pushed. This could include source files (for example .coffee files), or any other file in the git repository you don\'t want pushed to the S3 bucket. Files are specified in a JSON list of regexes. For example: `"Ignore":["src/*.coffee"]`\n\n- `IncludeNonGit`: Files not tracked by git that should be pushed to the destination bucket. Files are specified in a JSON list of paths. Paths can be absolute or relative to the root of the git repository.\n\n## License\n* MIT license. See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/bobbo/git-s3-push/blob/master/LICENSE) file.\n'
