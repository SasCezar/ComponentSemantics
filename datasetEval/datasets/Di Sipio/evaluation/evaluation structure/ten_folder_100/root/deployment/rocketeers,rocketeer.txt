It is inspired by the [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com/) philosophy and thus aims to be fast, elegant, and more importantly easy to use.\n\nLike the latter, emphasis is put on smart defaults and modern development. While it is coded in PHP, it can deploy any project from small HTML/CSS websites to large Rails applications.\n\n## Main features\n\n- **Versatile**, support for multiple connections, multiserver connections, multiple stages per server, etc.\n- **Fast**, queue tasks and run them in parallel across all your servers and stages\n- **Modulable**, not only can you add custom tasks and components, every core part of Rocketeer can be hot swapped, extended, hacked to bits, etc.\n- **Preconfigured**, tired of defining the same routines again and again ? Rocketeer is made for modern development and comes with smart defaults and built-in tasks such as installing your application's dependencies\n- **Powerful**, releases management, server checks, rollbacks, etc. Every feature you'd expect from a deployment tool is there\n\n## Installation\n\nThe fastest way is to grab the binary:\n\n```bash\n$ wget http://rocketeer.autopergamene.eu/versions/rocketeer.phar\n$ chmod +x rocketeer.phar\n$ mv rocketeer.phar /usr/local/bin/rocketeer\n```\n\nMore ways to setup Rocketeer can be found in the [official documentation](http://rocketeer.autopergamene.eu/#/docs/docs/I-Introduction/Getting-started).\n\n## Usage\n\nThe available commands in Rocketeer are :\n\n```\n$ php rocketeer\n  check        Check if the server is ready to receive the application\n  cleanup      Clean up old releases from the server\n  current      Display what the current release is\n  deploy       Deploys the website\n  flush        Flushes Rocketeer's cache of credentials\n  help         Displays help for a command\n  ignite       Creates Rocketeer's configuration\n  list         Lists commands\n  rollback     Rollback to the previous release, or to a specific one\n  setup        Set up the remote server for deployment\n  strategies   Lists the available options for each strategy\n  teardown     Remove the remote applications and existing caches\n  test         Run the tests on the server and displays the output\n  update       Update the remote server without doing a new release\n```\n\nDocumentation can be [found here](http://rocketeer.autopergamene.eu/#/docs/rocketeer/README)\n\n## Testing\n\n``` bash\n$ composer test\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n## Security\n\nIf you discover any security related issues, please email :author_email instead of using the issue tracker.\n\n## Credits\n\n- [Anahkiasen](https://github.com/Anahkiasen)\n- [All Contributors](https://github.com/rocketeers/rocketeer/contributors)\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT).

I've used Capistrano in the past, it does everything you want it to do, that's a given.\n\nBut, it remains a Ruby package and one that's tightly coupled to Rails in some ways; Rocketeer makes it so that you don't have Ruby files hanging around your app. That way you configure it once and can use it wherever you want in the realm of your application, even outside of the deploy routine.\nIt's also meant to be a lot easier to comprehend, for first-time users or novices, Capistrano is a lot to take in at once \xe2\x80\x93 Rocketeer aims to be as simple as possible by providing smart defaults and speeding up the time between installing it and first hitting `deploy`.\n\nIt's also more thought out for the PHP world \xe2\x80\x93 although you can configure Capistrano to run Composer and PHPUnit, that's not something it expects from the get go, while those tasks that are a part of every PHP developer are integrated in Rocketeer's core deploy process.\n"
