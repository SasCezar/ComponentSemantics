b'Kickster\n========\n\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/nielsenramon/kickster](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/nielsenramon/kickster?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\nKickster provides a basic Jekyll project setup packed with web best practises and useful optimization tools increasing your overall project quality. Kickster ships with automated and worry-free deployment scripts for GitHub Pages.\n\nUsed tools:\n\n  - [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)\n  - [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/)\n  - [Html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer)\n  - [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)\n  - [Jekyll Assets](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-assets)\n  - [Jekyll Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)\n  - [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) (Influenced by)\n  - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you haven\'t installed the following tools then go ahead and do so (make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed):\n\n    brew install ruby\n    brew install npm\n\nOn windows, install Ruby and Node with the installers found here:\n\n  - [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/)\n  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\n\nInstall the gem:\n\n    gem install kickster\n\nExecute gem and scaffold Kickster files:\n\n    kickster new site_name\n\nSetup your environment:\n\n    cd site_name\n    bin/setup\n\nYou can push your project to any branch except `gh-pages`. For `sitename.github.io` repo users make sure to use another branch than `master`.\n\n## Development\n\nRun Jekyll:\n\n    bundle exec jekyll serve\n\n*If you do not want the Kickster setup but just the deploy scripts then copy them from the `bin` folder.*\n\n## Deploy to GitHub Pages\n\nRun this in the root project folder in your console:\n\n    bin/deploy\n\n*Don\'t forget to enable your repository on [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/docs/getting-started) and update the `_config.yml` file with your url!*\n\n## Automated deployment with Circle CI\n\nAutomated deployment is by default not included in your Kickster generated Jekyll project. Please follow the steps below to include automated deployment.\n\n*Note that changes will only deploy when your code is merged into master.*\n\n#### 1. Copy the required automated deploy script\n\nCopy the [automated](https://github.com/nielsenramon/kickster/blob/master/snippets/circle/automated) script inside the `/bin` folder of your project (make sure the file has execute permissions!).\n\n#### 2. Update `circle.yml`\n\nReplace your `circle.yml` file with [this](https://github.com/nielsenramon/kickster/blob/master/snippets/circle/circle.yml) one. And adjust the following 2 lines with your information:\n\n    - USER_NAME: <your-github-username>\n    - USER_EMAIL: <your-github-email>\n\n#### 3. Enable Circle CI.\n\nMake sure you enabled your repository on Circle CI.\nAfter that we have to create a Read/Write deployment key. All 3 steps can be found [here](https://circleci.com/docs/adding-read-write-deployment-key/).\n\nIn short:\n\n  1. Create a ssh key on your computer: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"` (leave the passphrase empty).\n\n  2. Create a new deploy key in your GitHub project and paste the public key in there and make sure you "Allow write access".\n\n  ![Enable Circle CI Step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nielsenramon/kickster/master/images/kickster-step2.png)\n  3. Create a new SSH key in the "SSH Permissions" tab under your project settings in Circle CI and paste the private key in there with the hostname: `github.com`.\n\n  ![Enable Circle CI Step 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nielsenramon/kickster/master/images/kickster-step3.png)\n\nThat\'s it, start pushing changes and enjoy your automated deployments from now on!\n\n_Want to use Travis CI?
