b"# ZEIT Now Examples\n\nThis is the public list of examples for **ZEIT Now**.\n\nAll of these ready to deploy examples feature a frontend framework or static site, created with zero configuration using the CLI tools they provide.\n\nThe `+functions` examples feature an `/api` directory as well, highlighting how to use serverless functions on top of a framework, again with zero configuration required.\n\n## What is ZEIT Now?\n\nZEIT Now is a cloud platform for static frontends and serverless functions. It enables developers to host websites and web applications that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and require no supervision.\n\n## What Does this Repository Contain?\n\nThis repository consists of multiple examples, created for use with the [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/now) platform. In addition to this, it also contains:\n\n- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - our Code of Conduct, adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org)\n- [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) - a guide on how to contribute to the Now Examples repository\n- [License](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/blob/master/LICENSE.md) - the standard MIT license under which these examples are published\n- [`manifest.json`](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/blob/master/manifest.json) - a JSON file that makes examples available as template on the ZEIT dashboard\n\nWe recommend familiarizing yourself with the above sections, particularly if you are looking to make a contribution.\n\n## Deploying Examples\n\nTo get started using any of these examples as your own project, [install Now](https://zeit.co/download) and use either of the following commands in your terminal:\n\n```sh\nnow init                    # Pick an example in the CLI\nnow init <example>          # Create a new project from a specific <example>\nnow init <example> <name>   # Create a new project from a specific <example> with a different folder <name>\n```\n\nDeploying your project takes seconds and can be done with **just a single command**:\n\n```sh\nnow                         # Deploys the project with Now\n```\n\nWith the `now` command, your project will be built and served by Now, providing you with a URL that can be shared immediately.\n\n## New Examples\n\nWe are continuously improving our examples based on best practices and feedback from the community. As a result, it is possible that example names will change and on occasion deprecated in favor of an improved implementation.\n\nFor example, the previous `nodejs` example showed a static frontend with a Node.js API. This is illustrated now in the `svelte-functions` example. Below is a table that lists some of the most popular previous examples and the equivalent replacement:\n\n| Previous Example  | New Example                                                                                               |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **monorepo**      | [gatsby-functions](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/gatsby-functions)                     |\n| **nodejs**        | [svelte-functions](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/svelte-functions)                     |\n| **nextjs-static** | [nextjs](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/nextjs)                                         |\n| **vanilla-go**    | [create-react-app-functions](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/create-react-app-functions) |\n| **typescript**    | [gatsby-functions](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/gatsby-functions)                     |\n\n## Migrating and Upgrading\n\nIf you have an existing project you would like to deploy with ZEIT Now, we recommend reading our guide on [migrating to Now and zero configuration](https://zeit.co/guides/migrate-to-zeit-now/). By combining the guide with this repository, you will quickly be able to understand how to deploy your application.\n\nIf you would like to upgrade a project to take advantage of zero configuration, you may find the [upgrade guide](https://zeit.co/guides/upgrade-to-zero-configuration/) useful. The upgrade guide covers how to remove configuration from existing projects along with how to use the `/api` directory.\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nContributing to Now Examples should be an enjoyable experience, as such we have created a set of [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/zeit/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to help you do so.\n\nThe guidelines cover important information such as the requirements for new examples and where to get help if you have any questions.\n\nWe have tried to make contributing to Now Examples as easy as possible, especially for those new to Open Source.
