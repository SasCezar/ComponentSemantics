b'# Crowbar Documentation README\n\n[![Reviewed by Hound](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reviewed_by-Hound-8E64B0.svg)](https://houndci.com)\n\n_This is not the documentation you are looking for... it is a pointer to the real documentation._\n\n## Looking for Crowbar Resources?\n\n[The Crowbar website](https://crowbar.github.io) has links to all information and is our recommended starting place.\n\n## Specific Crowbar Documentation\n\nWe track Crowbar documentation with the code so that we can track versions of documentation with the code.\n\nHere are commonly requested references:\n\n* [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar/blob/master/doc/gettingstarted.md)\n\n> You may need to look in subdirectories under the links above for additional details.\n\n## Background\nCrowbar documentation is distributed into multiple places under the /doc directory of each Crowbar module (aka "barclamps").  When the modules are installed, Crowbar combines all the /doc directories into a master documentation set.  These directories are structured into subdirectories for general topics.  This structure is common across all barclamps in the [Crowbar project](https://github.com/crowbar/)\n\n> Please, do NOT add documentation in locations besides /doc!  If necessary, expand this README to include pointers to important /doc information.\n\n'
