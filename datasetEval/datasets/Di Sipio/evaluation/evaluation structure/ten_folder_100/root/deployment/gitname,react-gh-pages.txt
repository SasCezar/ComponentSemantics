b'# Deploying a React App* to GitHub Pages\n\n\\* created using `create-react-app`\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial, I\'ll show you how I deployed a React app\xe2\x80\x94which I created using `create-react-app`\xe2\x80\x94to GitHub Pages.\n\nYou can visit the deployed app, at [https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages/](https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages/).\n\nThis repository contains the files related to the app. The `master` branch contains the app\'s source code (the code the app\'s developers edit), and the `gh-pages` branch contains a *built* version of the app (i.e. the code that GitHub Pages serves to the app\'s visitors).\n\nThe remainder of this document contains a tutorial on creating a React app (using `create-react-app`) and deploying that app to GitHub Pages.\n\n# Tutorial\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. An adequate version of [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) is installed. Here\'s the adequate version I use:\n\n    ```sh\n    $ node --version\n    v6.10.1\n    ```\n\n2. An adequate version of  [`npm`](https://nodejs.org/) is installed. Here\'s the adequate version I use:\n\n    ```sh\n    $ npm --version\n    3.10.10\n    ```\n3. An adequate version of [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is installed. Here\'s the adequate version I use:\n\n    ```sh\n    $ create-react-app --version\n    1.3.1\n    ```\n\n    In the case of `create-react-app`, you can either install it globally (i.e. `$ npm install -g create-react-app`) or install it locally (i.e. `$ npm install create-react-app`). If you choose the latter, you will have to specify its path whenever you invoke it (e.g. `path/to/node_modules/.bin/create-react-app`).\n\n4. (**Optional**) An adequate version of [`sed`](http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) is installed. Here\'s the adequate version I use:\n\n   ```sh\n   $ sed --version\n   sed (GNU sed) 4.4\n   ```\n\n5. A [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account. :octocat:\n\n6. A command-line Git client [setup according to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).\n\n## Procedure\n\n1. **Create an *empty* repository on GitHub.** (2 minutes)\n\n    * For this tutorial, I\'ll create a repository named `react-gh-pages`.\n    * By *empty*, I mean *without* a `README.md` file, a `.gitignore` file, a `LICENSE` file, or any other files.\n\n2. **Create a new React app on your computer.** (5 minutes)\n\n    ```sh\n    $ create-react-app react-gh-pages\n    ```\n    \n    * This is the app you will deploy to GitHub Pages in step 7.\n    * I opted to give the app the same name as my GitHub repository (i.e. `react-gh-pages`). However, you can name them differently from one another (e.g. you can name your app `app-123` and your GitHub Repository `repo-456`).\n    * This will create a new folder named `react-gh-pages` (or whatever you named your app) on your computer.\n\n3. **Install the `gh-pages` package as a "dev-dependency" of the app.** (1 minute)\n\n    ```\n    $ cd react-gh-pages\n    $ npm install gh-pages --save-dev\n    ```\n    \n    * The commands shown in the following steps can all be issued from within the app\'s folder.\n\n4. **Add some properties to the app\'s `package.json` file.** (3 minutes)\n\n    * At the top level, add a `homepage` property. Define its value to be the string `http://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}`, where `{username}` is your GitHub username, and `{repo-name}` is the name of the GitHub repository you created in step 1. Since my GitHub username is `gitname` and the name of my GitHub repository is `react-gh-pages`, I added the following property:\n    \n    ```js\n    //...\n    "homepage": "http://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages"\n    ```\n    \n    * In the existing `scripts` property, add a `predeploy` property and a `deploy` property, each having the values shown below:\n\n    ```js\n    "scripts": {\n      //...\n      "predeploy": "npm run build",\n      "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    * **Shortcut:** Instead of adding those properties using a text editor; if I have `sed` installed on my system, I can add the properties by issuing the following shell commands:\n    \n    ```sh\n    $ sed -i \'5i\\  "homepage": "http://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages",\' ./package.json\n    $ sed -i \'15i\\    "predeploy": "npm run build",\' ./package.json\n    $ sed -i \'16i\\    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",\' ./package.json\n    ```\n    \n5. **Create a git repository in the app\'s folder.** (1 minute)\n\n    ```\n    $ git init\n    Initialized empty Git repository in C:/path/to/react-gh-pages/.git/\n    ```\n\n6. **Add the GitHub repository as a "remote" in your local git repository.** (1 minute)\n\n    ```\n    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages.git\n    ```\n    \n    * This will make it so the `gh-pages` package knows where you want it to deploy your app in step 7.\n    * It will also make it so git knows where you want it to push your source code (i.e. the commits on your `master` branch) in step 8.\n\n7. **Generate a *production build* of your app, and deploy it to GitHub Pages.** (2 minutes)\n\n    ```\n    $ npm run deploy\n    ```\n    \n    * That\'s it! Your app is now accessible at the URL you specified in step 4.\n    * In my case, my app is now accessible at: https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages/\n    * I recommend exploring the GitHub repository at this point. When I explored it, I noticed that, although a `master` branch did not exist, a `gh-pages` branch did exist. I noticed the latter contained the *built* app code, as opposed to the app\'s source code.\n\n8. **Optionally, commit your source code to the "master" branch and push your commit to GitHub.** (1 minute)\n\n    ```\n    $ git add .\n    $ git commit -m "Create a React app and publish it to GitHub Pages"\n    $ git push origin master\n    ```\n\n    * I recommend exploring the GitHub repository once again at this point. When I did that, I noticed that a `master` branch now existed, and it contained the app\'s source code.\n    * So, the `master` branch held the source code, and the `gh-pages` branch held the *built* app code.\n\n# References\n\n1. [Facebook\'s tutorial on deploying a React app to GitHub Pages](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment#github-pages-https-pagesgithubcom)\n\n# Notes\n\n* I created this React app using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). By default, apps created using `create-react-app` have a README.md file that looks like [this](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). Indeed, the README.md file you\'re now reading originally looked like that. I have since changed it to look the way it looks today.\n* Special thanks to GitHub, Inc., for providing us with the GitHub Pages hosting functionality at no extra charge.\n* And now, time to turn the default `create-react-app` app into something unique!\n'
