It can help with installation,\nDNS, DHCP, package updates, power management, configuration management orchestration, and much more.\n\nRead more at [https://cobbler.github.io](https://cobbler.github.io)\n\nTo view the manpages, install the RPM and run `man cobbler` or run `perldoc cobbler.pod` from a source checkout.\n\nTo build the RPM, run `make rpms`.
