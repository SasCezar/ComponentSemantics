b'# Seldon Core ![API](./doc/source/seldon.png)\n\nSeldon Core is an open source platform for deploying machine learning models on a Kubernetes cluster.\n\n * Deploy machine learning models in the cloud or on-premise.\n * Get metrics and ensure proper governance and compliance for your running machine learning models.\n * Create powerful inference graphs made up of multiple components.\n * Provide a consistent serving layer for models built using heterogeneous ML toolkits.\n\n## So Why Seldon?\n\n * Lets you focus on your model by [making it easy to serve on kubernetes](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/workflow/README.html)\n * The same workflow and base API for a range of toolkits such as scikit-learn, tensorflow and R\n * Out of the box best-practices for logging, tracing and base metrics, applicable to all models across toolkits\n * Support for deployment strategies such as running A/B test and canaries\n * Inferences graphs for microservice-based serving strategies such as multi-armed bandits or pre-processing\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation can be found [here](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/).\n\n## Community\n\n * [Join our Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/seldondev/shared_invite/enQtMzA2Mzk1Mzg0NjczLTJlNjQ1NTE5Y2MzMWIwMGUzYjNmZGFjZjUxODU5Y2EyMDY0M2U3ZmRiYTBkOTRjMzZhZjA4NjJkNDkxZTA2YmU)\n\n\n| Branch      | Status |\n|-------------|-------|\n| master      | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SeldonIO/seldon-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SeldonIO/seldon-core) |\n| release-0.3 | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SeldonIO/seldon-core.svg?branch=release-0.3)](https://travis-ci.org/SeldonIO/seldon-core) |\n| release-0.2 | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SeldonIO/seldon-core.svg?branch=release-0.2)](https://travis-ci.org/SeldonIO/seldon-core) |\n| release-0.1 | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SeldonIO/seldon-core.svg?branch=release-0.1)](https://travis-ci.org/SeldonIO/seldon-core) |\n\n\n'
