This makes TYPO3 Console a perfect companion for development, deployment, Docker setups, continuous integration workflows or anything else where automation is required or beneficial.\n\nExamples for such commands are:\n\n* `typo3cms install:setup` to completely set up TYPO3 from command line\n* `typo3cms upgrade:all` to execute upgrades from command line\n* `typo3cms extension:setupactive` to set up all active extensions (database schema update, data import, \xe2\x80\xa6)\n\n## Features\n* TYPO3 installation and upgrades from command line\n* Flexible bootstrap for commands (not every command needs a fully bootstrapped framework)\n* Reliable cache flush commands\n* Many commands useful for deployment\n* Support for command controllers and Symfony commands registered within TYPO3 extensions and Composer packages\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installation using Composer\n\nThe recommended way to install TYPO3 Console is by using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):\n\n    composer require helhum/typo3-console\n\nThe `typo3cms` binary will be installed by Composer in the specified `bin-dir` (by default `vendor/bin`).\nTYPO3 Console is a perfect companion for Composer-based, enjoyable [TYPO3 projects](https://github.com/helhum/TYPO3-Distribution).\n\n### Installation as extension from TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER)\n\nDownload and install the extension with the *Extensions* module.\nFor the extension to work, it **must** be installed in the `typo3conf/ext` directory **not** in any other extension location.\nThis directory **must not** be a symlink to another location!\nThe `typo3cms` command line tool will be copied into the installation root directory during activation,\nin case it is not present as a symlink to `typo3conf/ext/typo3_console/Libraries/helhum/typo3-console/typo3cms`.\nThe build extension is automatically published to [TER](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/typo3_console/)\nand to a [read only repository](https://github.com/TYPO3-Console/Extension) representing the released state as tags,\nas well as current state of development in the respective branches.\n\n## Submit bug reports or feature requests\n\nLook at the [Issues](https://github.com/TYPO3-Console/typo3_console/issues)\nfor what has been planned to be implemented in the (near) future.\n\n## Credits\nThanks to all contributors and everybody providing feedback.\n\nSpecial thanks to [@hzoo](https://github.com/hzoo) for creating great Github issue templates for [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel),\nwhich were adopted for this package.\n'
