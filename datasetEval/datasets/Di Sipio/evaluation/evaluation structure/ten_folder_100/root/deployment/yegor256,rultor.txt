It helps your programmers and\nrelease managers automate routine operations (merge, deploy and release),\nwith an easy-to-use intuitive chat-bot interface. Just say `@rultor hello` in\nany of your GitHub issue and the converstaion will start.\n\nFull documentation is at [doc.rultor.com](http://doc.rultor.com)\n\nNeed help online?

Rultor attempts to\ntackle the problems those scripts do not.\n\nThe first benefit of Rultor is that it gives you isolation of your deployment\nscript in its own virtual environment by using Docker containers. This\nsubstantially reduces the amount of external state that could affect your build\nand makes errors more easily reproducible.\n\nAdditionally, because of the way Rultor integrates with modern issue trackers,\nall the logs are stored and published to the ticket on which Rultor was\nmentioned. Making vital information easily accessible to all developers.\n\nRultor performs pre-flight builds. Instead of merging into master and then\nseeing if your changes broke the build or not, Rultor checks out the master\nbranch, apply your changes to it, then runs everything it was set up to run.\nIf, and only if, everything goes well, Rultor merges the changes into master.\nThis programmatically prevents the master from being broken by developers. Not\nhaving to worry about breaking the build for everyone else has a very positive\nimpact in the way developers write code, increasing their productivity and\nmitigating their fear of making mistakes.\n\nLastly, Rultor provides an integrated and humanized interface to DevOps tools,\nas a human-readable sentence suffices to trigger a merge or a release.\n\n## How Rultor Works?\n\nOnce Rultor finds a [merge command](http://doc.rultor.com/basics.html)\nin one of your GitHub pull requests, it does exactly this:\n\n  1. Reads the [.rultor.yml](http://doc.rultor.com/reference.html) YAML configuration file from the root directory of your repository.\n  2. Gets automated build execution command from it, for example `bundle test`.\n  3. Checks out your repository into a temporary directory on one of its servers.\n  4. Merges pull request into `master` branch.\n  5. Starts a new Docker container and runs the build execution command in it, for example `bundle test`.\n  6. If everything is fine, pushes modified `master` branch to GitHub.\n  7. Reports back to you, in the GitHub pull request.\n\nYou can see it in action, for example, in this pull request:\n[jcabi/jcabi-github#878](https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github/pull/878).\n\n'
