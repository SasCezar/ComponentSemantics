b"# Progressive Web App\n> A production grade progressive web app, to hit the ground running.\n\n## Setup\n```\n$ npm install\n```\n\n## ENV Variables\n- NODE_ENV (build-dependent)\n  - development: modules are bundled as is\n  - production: modules are minified and uglified\n\n- PWA_ENV (build-dependent)\n  - development: configs are obtained from /config/development.js\n  - production: configs are obtained from /config/production.js\n  - customPwaEnv: configs are obtained from /config/customPwaEnv.js\n\n- PWA_PUBLIC_PATH (build-dependent)\n  - /build/client/: assets are fetched from the local filesystem\n  - /production.cdn.com/build/client/: assets are fetched from this cdn path\n  - /custom/path/: assets are fetched from /custom/path/\n\n- PWA_SSR (build-independent)\n  - true: enable server side data fetching and rendering\n  - false: disable server side data fetching and rendering\n\n- PORT (build-independent)\n  - 8000: serve the app at port 8000\n  - 1337: serve the app at port 1337\n\n*build-dependent: if any of these variables values have to be changed, assuming you change `PWA_PUBLIC_PATH=//other.cdn.com` in the `staging:build` script, then it requires a rebuild and a restart, `npm run staging`*\n\n*build-independent: if any of these variable values have to be changed, assuming you change `PWA_SSR=false` in the `staging:start` script, then it only requires a restart, `npm run staging:start`*\n\n## Usage\nThere are some useful npm scripts setup for you to start using these ENV variables effectively, please look at [package.json](./package.json) to better understand how they're setup for each script.\n\n>Remember to run `npm stop` to stop all the pwa pm2 instances before using a different script from below.\n\nStart as local development server with file watching:\n```bash\n$ npm start\n# runs at http://localhost:8000\n# npm run stop is automatically called for you after\n# hitting ctrl+c to quit the webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nStart as local production server:\n```bash\n$ npm run development\n# runs at http://localhost:1337\n```\n\nStart as staging server:\n```bash\n$ npm run staging\n# runs at http://localhost:1337\n```\n\nStart as production server:\n```bash\n$ npm run production\n# runs at http://localhost:1337\n```\n\nUsing pm2:\n```bash\n$ npm run pm2 -- logs # follow all server logs\n$ npm run pm2 -- list # list all processes\n$ npm run pm2 -- kill # kill pm2 parent process\n$ npm run pm2 -- help # show other available commands\n```\n\n## License\n[MIT](./LICENSE)\n"
