These projects can and should be used as a starter and will be copied over to their own repository. Hence they contain example data and additional Gatsby plugins (e.g. `gatsby-plugin-manifest` and `gatsby-plugin-offline`). The folder names are the contents after `gatsby-theme-*`\n- `jest`: Primarily files for mocking functions/files in Jest tests\n- `plop-templates`: Template for [plop.js](https://plopjs.com/)\n- `scripts`: In order to run the tests on CircleCI some utility bash scripts are needed which are located here\n- `themes`: Contains the themes themselves. They should only have the bare minimum of plugins installed (as `examples` can expand them) and also use `Theme UI` for styling. The naming of the folders must be `gatsby-theme-[name-with-dashes]` and the package name under the scope of `@lekoarts`\n- `www`: Contains the source code for [themes.lekoarts.de](http://themes.lekoarts.de)\n\n## \xf0\x9f\xa4\x9d How to Contribute\n\nMake sure that you have `yarn` installed on your machine (as it\'s mandatory for `yarn workspaces`). Fork this repository, clone it and run `yarn` in the root directory.\n\nTo launch the development server of an example site, use:\n\n```sh\nyarn workspace [examples/name] develop\n```\n\nOr for a build:\n\n```sh\nyarn workspace [examples/name] build\n```\n\nIn the case of `examples/emma` this command would be `yarn workspace emma develop`. Now you can make changes to the respective theme and see them via Hot-Reloading.\n\nCommit your changes to a feature branch of your fork and open up a PR against this repository. The PR will have checks in place (unit and end-to-end tests) which you can also run on your machine in preparation for the PR.\n\nHave a look at the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more.\n\n## \xf0\x9f\xa4\xa9 Newsletter\n\nIf you want to receive monthly updates on my themes and all things related to Gatsby themes (relevant blog posts from me and other people, articles about Theme UI) you can [subscribe to my newsletter](https://leko.io/newsletter-themes).\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x8e\x93 Learning Gatsby Themes\n\n### Articles from lekoarts.de\n\n- [How I used Theme UI to build my Gatsby Themes library](https://www.lekoarts.de/en/blog/how-i-used-theme-ui-to-build-my-gatsby-themes-library)\n- [Setting up a Gatsby Themes workspace with TypeScript, ESLint & Cypress](https://www.lekoarts.de/en/blog/setting-up-a-gatsby-themes-workspace-with-typescript-eslint-and-cypress)\n- [Specimens for Gatsby powered Design Systems](https://www.lekoarts.de/en/blog/specimens-for-gatsby-powered-design-systems)\n- [Creating your own Status Dashboard with Gatsby](https://www.lekoarts.de/en/blog/creating-your-own-status-dashboard-with-gatsby)\n\n### Official resources\n\n- [Gatsbyjs.org - Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/)\n- [Building a Theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/building-a-theme)\n- [Free egghead.io "Gatsby Theme Authoring" course](https://egghead.io/courses/gatsby-theme-authoring)\n'
