b'# React-babel-webpack-es6 Starter Project\n\nA boilerplate using React, webpack and hot module reloading, and ES6 + JSX via Babel.You could use it as a base to build your own web app.\n\n## Features\n\nThe provided boilerplate enables client-side ES6 via the following technologies:\n\n- [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) as a client-side module builder and module loader.\n- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as a package manager and task runner\n- [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) 6 as a transpiler from ES6 to ES5.\n- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) as a virtual Dom JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (views).\n- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) as a reporter for syntax and style issues. [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react) for additional React specific linting rules.\n- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) as a compiler of CSS styles with variables, mixins, and more.\n- Inline base64 URLs for images and fonts if their size is less than specified limit of [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack/file-loader)\n- Image compression processing of  [image-webpack-loader](https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader)\n- Watch `index.html` for changes of [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation\n\nyou should clone the repo and install the dependencies.\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/chenbin92/react-redux-webpack-starter.git app-name\n$ cd app-name\n$ npm install  //or cnpm install\n```\n\n## Development\nIn the development mode. launch the boilerplate app\xef\xbc\x9a\n\n```\n// run the dev server http://localhost:8080\n\n$ npm start  \n```\n\nyou should see a new browser tap opening and a title of "Hello React\xe2\x80\x9d in [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/), page hot reloads automatically when there are changes\n\n![Webpack-dashboard](http://i2.buimg.com/4851/c971b58acc349be2.png)\n![homepage](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3995814/16775798/ef9cf446-4894-11e6-9510-af171fec3107.png)\n\nWhen you run npm start:\n\n- The sass-loader compiles Sass into CSS\n- Webpack bundles the compiled CSS\xe3\x80\x81JS  into `bundle.js` \n\n## Production\n\nIn the production mode,  you can:\n\n```\n// run the prod server http://localhost:9090\n\n$ npm run start: prod\n```\n\n```\n// build the static files.\n\n$ npm run build \n```\n\n```npm run build```. This will prepare and build the project for production use. It does the following:\n\n- Minifies all JS and CSS\n- Inline base64 URLs for images and fonts if their size is less than specified limit\n- Sets NODE_ENV to production so that React is built in production mode\n- Places the resulting built project files into `/build` directory\n\n## All configuration tasks\n\n-  `npm start`:  start the development model of server\n-  `npm run start:prod`: start the production model of server\n-  `npm run build`: compile code in production mode\n-  `npm run lint`:  lint with ESlint and Airbnb\'s style sheet. \n-  `npm run lint:watch`: eslint watching\n-  `npm run remove:build`: remove the dist directory\n-  `npm run clean:build `:  clean the dist directory\n\n## TODO\n\n- [ ] add test\n\n## Others\n\n* [more information](https://github.com/chenbin92/react-redux-webpack-starter/issues/1)\n'
