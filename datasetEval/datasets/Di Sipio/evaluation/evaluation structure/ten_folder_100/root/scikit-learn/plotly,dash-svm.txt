b'# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Explorer [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/plotly/dash-svm.svg)](https://github.com/plotly/dash-svm/blob/master/LICENSE.md) [![Mentioned in Awesome Machine Learning](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning)\n\n\n\nThis is a learning tool and exploration app made using the Dash interactive Python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).\n\nDash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application and is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your Python code. To learn more check out our [documentation](https://plot.ly/dash).\n\nTry out the [demo app here](https://dash-svm.plot.ly/).\n\n![animated1](images/animated1.gif)\n\n\n## Getting Started\n### Using the demo\nThis demo lets you interactive explore Support Vector Machine (SVM). \n\nIt includes a few artificially generated datasets that you can choose from the dropdown, and that you can modify by changing the sample size and the noise level of those datasets.\n\nThe other dropdowns and sliders lets you change the parameters of your classifier, such that it could increase or decrease its accuracy.\n\n### Running the app locally\n\nFirst create a virtual environment with conda or venv inside a temp folder, then activate it.\n\n```\nvirtualenv dash-svm-venv\n\n# Windows\ndash-svm-venv\\Scripts\\activate\n# Or Linux\nsource venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nClone the git repo, then install the requirements with pip\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/plotly/dash-svm.git\ncd dash-svm\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nRun the app\n```\npython app.py\n```\n\n## About the app\n### How does it work?\n\nThis app is fully written in Dash + scikit-learn. All the components are used as input parameters for scikit-learn functions, which then generates a model with respect to the parameters you changed. The model is then used to perform predictions that are displayed on a contour plot, and its predictions are evaluated to create the ROC curve and confusion matrix.\n\nIn addition to creating models, scikit-learn is used to generate the datasets you see, as well as the data needed for the metrics plots.\n\n### What is an SVM?\nAn SVM is a popular Machine Learning model used in many different fields. You can find an [excellent guide to how to use SVMs here](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/guide/guide.pdf).\n\n## Built With\n* [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/) - Main server and interactive components\n* [Plotly Python](https://plot.ly/python/) - Used to create the interactive plots\n* [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html) - Run the classification algorithms and generate datasets\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.\n\n## Authors\n\n* **Xing Han Lu** - *Initial Work* - [@xhlulu](https://github.com/xhlulu)\n* **Matthew Chan** - *Code Review* - [@matthewchan15](https://github.com/matthewchan15)\n\nSee also the list of [contributors](https://github.com/plotly/dash-svm/contributors) who participated in this project.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details\n\n## Acknowledgments\nThe heatmap configuration is heavily inspired from the [scikit-learn Classification Comparison Tutorial](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html). Please go take a look!\n\nThe idea of the [ROC Curve, the Matrix Pie Chart and Thresholding](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/dash-roc) came from @nickruchten. The app would not have been as complete without his insightful advice.\n\n## Screenshots\n'
