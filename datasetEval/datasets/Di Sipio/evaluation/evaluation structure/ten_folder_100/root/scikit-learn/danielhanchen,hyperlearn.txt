b'*[Due to the time taken @ uni, work + hell breaking loose in my life, since things have calmed down a bit, will continue commiting!!!]*\n*[By the way, I\'m still looking for new contributors! Please help make HyperLearn no1!!]*\n\n<a href="github.com/danielhanchen/hyperlearn/"><img src="Images/Umbra Header.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/></a>\n\n*Regardless of where you are, Umbra allows you to solve humanity\'s most pressing issues, including poverty, crime and climate change. By indexing public data with Artificial Intelligence, Umbra aims to create the world\'s first public simulation of Planet Earth.*\n\nI\'m recruiting for people who want to change the world! Do the quiz @ https://daniel3112.typeform.com/to/K84Qu0 :) I\'ll be waiting.\n\n*HyperLearn is what drives Umbra\'s AI engines. It is open source to everyone, everywhere, and we hope humanity can rise to the stars.*\n\n[Notice - I will be updating the package monthly or bi-weekly due to other commitments]\n\n---\n\n<a href="github.com/danielhanchen/hyperlearn/"><img src="Images/HyperLearn_Logo.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/></a>\nhttps://hyperlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\n\n***IMPOPRTANT***\n**This package is to be used only for the following purposes:**\n\n1. Not for Profit usage (eg: Red Cross, NASA, NOAA usage)\n2. Research Usage (eg: Universities)\n3. Non Commercial Personal usage (eg: hackathons)\nCommercial usage is strictly prohibted, unless express writing is given to danielhanchen@gmail.com\n\n*Faster, Leaner GPU Sklearn, Statsmodels written in PyTorch*\n\n![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/badges/shields.svg?style=popout-square)\n![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/atom/atom/total.svg?style=popout-square)\n\n\n**50%+ Faster, 50%+ less RAM usage, GPU support re-written Sklearn, Statsmodels combo with new novel algorithms.**\n\nHyperLearn is written completely in PyTorch, NoGil Numba, Numpy, Pandas, Scipy & LAPACK, and mirrors (mostly) Scikit Learn.\nHyperLearn also has statistical inference measures embedded, and can be called just like Scikit Learn\'s syntax (model.confidence_interval_) Ongoing documentation: https://hyperlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\n\nI\'m also writing a mini book! A sneak peak:\n<img src="Images/SVD.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>\n---\n\n<img src="Images/Packages_Used_long.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>\n\n### Comparison of Speed / Memory\n\n| Algorithm         |  n    |  p  | Time(s) |            | RAM(mb) |            | Notes                   |\n| ----------------- | ----- | --- | ------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |\n|                   |       |     | Sklearn | Hyperlearn | Sklearn | Hyperlearn |                         |\n| QDA (Quad Dis A)  |1000000| 100 |   54.2  |   *22.25*  |  2,700  |  *1,200*   | Now parallelized        |\n| LinearRegression  |1000000| 100 |   5.81  |   *0.381*  |   700   |    *10*    | Guaranteed stable & fast|\n\nTime(s) is Fit + Predict. RAM(mb) = max( RAM(Fit), RAM(Predict) )\n \nI\'ve also added some preliminary results for N = 5000, P = 6000\n<img src="Images/Preliminary Results N=5000 P=6000.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>\n\nSince timings are not good, I have submitted 2 bug reports to Scipy + PyTorch:\n1. EIGH very very slow --> suggesting an easy fix #9212 https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9212\n2. SVD very very slow and GELS gives nans, -inf #11174 https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/11174\n\n---\n#### Help is really needed!
