b'# Winerama  \n###### A web recommender tutorial tutorial using Python technologies such as Django, Pandas, or Scikit-learn, and others such as Bootstrap.\n\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/jadianes/winerama-recommender-tutorial](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/jadianes/winerama-recommender-tutorial?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\nThis repository contains the code for a wine reviews and recommendations web application, in different stages as git tags. The idea is that you can follow the **tutorials** through the **tags** listed below, and learn the different concepts explained in them. The tutorials include instructions on how to deploy the web using a [Koding account](https://koding.com/). However, Koding recently moved from solo to team accounts and the link provided to my Koding account deployment of the tutorial result is not working anymore. The tutorial can still be followed with no problem at all.       \n\n## Tutorials  \n\nThe following tutorials will guide you through each of the previous Git tags while learning different \nconcepts of data product development with Python.  \n\n#### [A Wine Review Website using Django and Bootstrap](https://github.com/jadianes/winerama-recommender-tutorial/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial_1.md)  \n\n#### [Adding User management](https://github.com/jadianes/winerama-recommender-tutorial/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial_2.md)  \n\n#### [Providing wine recommendations using K-Means](https://github.com/jadianes/winerama-recommender-tutorial/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial_3.md)  \n\n## Tags\n\n- [`stage-0`](https://github.com/jadianes/winerama-recommender-tutorial/tree/stage-0): an empty repo.  \n- [`stage-0.1`](https://github.com/jadianes/winerama-recommender-tutorial/tree/stage-0.1): a Django project with one app called `reviews`.
