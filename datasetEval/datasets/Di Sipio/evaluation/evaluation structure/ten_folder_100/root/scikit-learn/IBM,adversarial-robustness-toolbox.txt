Machine Learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, \nwhich are inputs (images, texts, tabular data, etc.) deliberately modified to produce a desired response by the Machine \nLearning model. ART provides the tools to build and deploy defences and test them with adversarial attacks. \n\nDefending Machine Learning models involves certifying and verifying model robustness and model hardening with \napproaches such as pre-processing inputs, augmenting training data with adversarial samples, and leveraging runtime \ndetection methods to flag any inputs that might have been modified by an adversary. The attacks implemented in ART \nallow creating adversarial attacks against Machine Learning models which is required to test defenses with \nstate-of-the-art threat models.\n\nDocumentation of ART: https://adversarial-robustness-toolbox.readthedocs.io\n\nGet started with [examples](examples/README.md) and [tutorials](notebooks/README.md)\n\nThe library is under continuous development.
