b'[![Bitcoin ABC Logo](https://www.bitcoinabc.org/img/bitcoinabclogo.png "Bitcoin ABC")](https://www.bitcoinabc.org)\n\nThe goal of Bitcoin ABC is to create sound money that is usable by everyone in\nthe world. We believe this is a civilization-changing technology which will\ndramatically increase human flourishing, freedom, and prosperity. The project\naims to achieve this goal by implementing a series of optimizations and\nprotocol upgrades that will enable peer-to-peer digital cash to scale many\norders of magnitude beyond current limits.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Cash?\n---------------------\n\n[Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoincash.org/) is an experimental digital\ncurrency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It\nuses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing\ntransactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.\nBitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from\nthe version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two split on August 1, 2017.\nBitcoin Cash and the Bitcoin Core version of Bitcoin share the same\ntransaction history up until the split.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin ABC?\n--------------------\n\nBitcoin ABC is the name of open-source software which enables the use of\nBitcoin Cash. It is a fork of the [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org)\nsoftware project.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nBitcoin ABC is released under the terms of the MIT license.
