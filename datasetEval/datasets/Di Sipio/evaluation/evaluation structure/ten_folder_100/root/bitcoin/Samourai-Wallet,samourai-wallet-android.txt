b'[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Samourai-Wallet/samourai-wallet-android.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Samourai-Wallet/samourai-wallet-android)\n\n# Samourai Wallet\n\n### Features:\n\n[Samourai Wallet features list](Samourai-Wallet-features.md)\n\n### Build:\n\nImport as Android Studio project. Should build "as is". PGP signed tagged releases correspond to builds that were issued via Google Play.\n\n### BIP44:\n\nSamourai implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), extends [bitcoinj](https://bitcoinj.github.io/).\n\n### BIP47:\n\nSamourai implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki) by Justus Ranvier. Extends BIP44 implementation (above). Further modifications have been made to incorporate Segwit addresses into BIP47.\n\n[Generic source code for BIP47.](https://github.com/SamouraiDev/BIP47_RPC)\n\n[BIP47 test vectors](https://gist.github.com/SamouraiDev/6aad669604c5930864bd)\n\n### BIP49 (Segwit):\n\nSamourai P2SH-P2WPKH implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0049.mediawiki) by Daniel Weigl and includes support for BIP49-specific XPUBs: [YPUB](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/sentinel-android/issues/16).\n\n### BIP69:\n\nSamourai implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0069.mediawiki) by Kristov Atlas.\n\n### BIP84 (Segwit):\n\nSamourai implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0084.mediawiki) by Pavol Rusnak.\n\n### BIP125 (Replace-by-fee, RBF):\n\nSamourai implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki) by David A. Harding and Peter Todd.\n\n### BIP141 (Segwit):\n\nSamourai spends to bech32 addresses P2WPKH based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki) by Eric Lombrozo, Johnson Lau and Pieter Wuille.\n\n### BIP173 (Segwit):\n\nSamourai implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) by Pieter Wuille and Greg Maxwell.\n\n### Spending:\n\nSamourai spends include the possibility of including custom fees as well as the use of batch spending (build up a list of batched outputs for grouped spend and fee savings).\n\n### Ricochet:\n\nSamourai implementation of multi-hop spend designed to outrun the baying pack of #KYCRunningDogs.\n\nRicochet using nLockTime (staggered) will spread out hops over different blocks and make sure that hops do not appear all at once in the mempool.\n\n### STONEWALL:\n\nSTONEWALL spend is designed to increase the number of combinations between inputs and outputs (transaction entropy). It replaces the previously used BIP126. The objective is to obtain a positive entropy score using [Boltzmann](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/boltzmann) evaluation of the transaction.\n\n### Stowaway:\n\nA Stowaway spend, also implemented as [PayJoin](https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/payjoin/), is a collaborative-spend carried out with another user. UTXOs are joined and the spend amount is cloaked. It is based on an [idea](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=139581.0) by Gregory Maxwell. \n\n### Tor:\n\nSamourai indicates whether or not connections are being routed via Tor Socks5 proxy (uses Orbot).\n\n### TestNet3:\n\nMainNet/TestNet selection is displayed when sideloading a new installation. To switch networks, make a backup of your current wallet, uninstall/reinstall (sideload) and select desired network.\n\n### OpenDime:\n\nPlug in your OpenDime using the appropriate OTG (On-The-Go) USB cable and Samourai can be used to view address and balance, validate the private key, and sweep balance to your wallet.\n\n### License:\n\n[Unlicense](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/samourai-wallet-android/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n### Contributing:\n\nAll development goes in \'develop\' branch - do not submit pull requests to \'master\'.\n\n### Dev contact:\n\n[PGP](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x72B5BACDFEDF39D7)\n\n### What we do:\n\n[Samourai HQ](https://samouraiwallet.com)\n\n[Sentinel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samourai.sentinel&hl=en)\n\n[PayNym.is](https://paynym.is)\n\n[OXT](https://oxt.me)\n\n[Sovereign.ly](http://sovereign.ly)\n\n[Mule Tools](http://mule.tools)\n'
