b"#Pyminer\n\nThis is a 'getwork' CPU mining client for bitcoin.\n\nIt is pure-python, and therefore very, very slow.  The purpose is to\nprovide a reference implementation of a miner, for study.\n\n##In order for this software to run you must build and run bitcoind from source on your computer.  \n"
