Persistence is achieved through a built-in server-less SQLite C++ interface. Installation via Docker is supported, but manual installation in a dedicated [Debian](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-cd/)/[Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), [Red Hat](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download), [CentOS](https://wiki.centos.org/Download) or macOS instance is recommended.\n\n![Web UI Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1634027/44740469-d5c7ff00-aafa-11e8-9252-73b9c1283adb.png)\n\nThe web UI is compatible with most web browsers/devices/resolutions, but Firefox or Chrome at 1600px are recommended. Doesn\'t require configuration of any web server (unless installed behind your own reverse proxy).\n\n### Compatible Exchanges\n\n||with Post-Only Orders support|without Post-Only|\n|---|---|---|\n|**without Maker fees**|[BitMEX](https://www.bitmex.com/) <sub>([fees](https://www.bitmex.com/app/fees))</sub><br> &#10239; _REST + WebSocket_|*none*|\n|**with Maker and Taker fees**|[Coinbase](https://pro.coinbase.com/) <sub>([fees](https://pro.coinbase.com/orders/fees))</sub><br> &#10239; _REST + WebSocket + FIX_<br><br>[HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/) <sub>([fees](https://hitbtc.com/fee-tier))</sub><br>[Bequant](https://bequant.io/) <sub>([fees](https://bequant.io/fees-and-limits))</sub><br> &#10239; _REST + WebSocket_<br><br>[Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) <sub>([fees](https://www.bitfinex.com/fees))</sub><br>[Ethfinex](https://www.ethfinex.com/) <sub>([fees](https://www.ethfinex.com/fees))</sub><br> &#10239; _REST + WebSocket_<br><br>[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) <sub>([fees](https://www.kraken.com/features/fee-schedule))</sub><br> &#10239; _REST_<br><br>[Poloniex](https://www.poloniex.com/) <sub>([fees](https://poloniex.com/fees/))</sub><br> &#10239; _REST_|[FCoin](https://fcoin.com/) <sub>([fees](https://support.fcoin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003715514))</sub><br> &#10239; _REST + WebSocket_|\n\nAll currency pairs are supported.\n\n## README\n- Documentation\n  - [README](#readme)\n  - [MANUAL](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md)\n- Installation\n  - [Docker Installation](#docker-installation)\n  - [Manual GIT Installation](#manual-git-installation)\n  - [Manual ZIP Installation](#manual-zip-installation)\n  - [After Manual Installation](#after-manual-installation)\n  - [Upgrade to the latest commit](#upgrade-to-the-latest-commit)\n  - [Multiple instances party time](#multiple-instances-party-time)\n- Information\n  - [Compatible Exchanges](#compatible-exchanges)\n  - [Configuration](#configuration)\n  - [Application Usage](#application-usage)\n  - [Web UI](#web-ui)\n  - [Databases](#databases)\n  - [Charts](#charts)\n  - [Cloud Hosting](#cloud-hosting)\n- Development\n  - [Build notes](#build-notes)\n  - [Changelogs](#unreleased-changelog)\n- Humans and Milk Mammals\n  - [Unlock](#unlock)\n  - [Donations](#donations)\n  - [Very Special Thanks](#very-special-thanks-to)\n  - [General Discussion](#general-discussion)\n  - [Help](#help)\n  - [Issues](#issues)\n\n### Docker Installation\n\nSee [etc/Dockerfile](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/tree/master/etc#dockerfile) section if you use winy (because the Manual Installation only works on unix-like platforms).\n\n### Manual GIT Installation\n\n0. Ensure you agree to install collaborative non-free software (see [Unlock](#unlock) section).\n\n1. Ensure your target machine has `git`, `make` and `vim` installed.\n\n2. Download it wherever you want (feel free to customize the suggested folder name K) and execute the installer:\n```\n $ git clone ssh://git@github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot K\n $ cd K\n $ make install\n```\n\n3. Open the config file in your favorite text editor:\n```\n $ vim K.sh\n```\n\nTo upgrade anytime see [Upgrade to the latest commit](#upgrade-to-the-latest-commit) section.\n\n### Manual ZIP Installation\n\n0. Ensure you agree to install collaborative non-free software (see [Unlock](#unlock) section).\n\n1. Ensure your target machine has `curl`, `make` and `vim` installed.\n\n2. Download it wherever you want (feel free to customize the suggested folder name K) and execute the installer:\n```\n $ mkdir K\n $ cd K\n $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/master/Makefile > Makefile\n $ make install\n```\n\n3. Open the config file in your favorite text editor:\n```\n $ vim K.sh\n```\n\nTo upgrade anytime just run `make reinstall`.\n\n### After Manual Installation\n\nSee [configuration](#configuration) section while setting up the configuration options in your new config file `K.sh`.\n\nOnce the config file is ready, you can start the bot:\n```\n $ ./K.sh\n```\n\nAlternatively use `make start` to run `K.sh` in the background using [screen](https://www.decf.berkeley.edu/help/unix/screen.html) (to see the output, attach the screen with `make screen` [or run all at once with `make start screen`]).\n\nFeel free to run `make stop` or `make restart` anytime, and don\'t forget to [read the fucking manual](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md).\n\nTroubleshooting:\n\n * If there is no wallet data on a given exchange, do a manual buy/sell order first using the website of the exchange.\n\n Optional:\n\n * See `./K.sh --help` and `make help`.\n\n * Use your own SSL certificate with `--ssl-crt` and `--ssl-key`, see [web ui](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot#web-ui) section. Otherwise, the unsecure built-in certificate is a fully featured default openssl, that you may just need to authorise in your browser.\n\n### Configuration\n\nSee [etc/K.sh.dist](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/etc/K.sh.dist) file or your own `./K.sh` file.\n\nIt just contains a few variables with examples ready to be reused. The very end of the file contains the code that starts the bot.\n\n### Upgrade to the latest commit\n\nAfter reinstalling, you will need to manually restart any running instances using `make restart` or `make restartall`.\n\nTo upgrade under Manual ZIP Installation, please run `make reinstall`.\n\nTo upgrade under Manual GIT Installation:\n\nFeel free anytime to check if there are new modifications with `make diff`.\n\nOnce you decide that is time to upgrade, execute `make latest` to download and install the latest modifications in your remote branch (or directly `make reinstall` to skip the validation of the new commit messages).\n\nIf you only use `git` to pull the latest commits, you will still need to recompile using `make reinstall` (or using `make dist K` or just `make` if you have modified source files) and then `make restart` to start using the latest version.\n\n### Multiple instances party time\n\nPlease note, an "instance" is in fact a `*.sh` config file located in the top level path; using a single machine and the same source folder, you can run as many instances as `*.sh` files you have in the top level path (limited by the available free RAM).\n\nYou can list the current running instances with `make list`.\n\nIf you haven\'t defined a config file, `make start`, `make screen`, `make stop` and `make restart` will use the default config file `K.sh`.\n\nTo run multiple instances using a collection of config files:\n\n1. Create a new config file with `cp etc/K.sh.dist X.sh && chmod +x X.sh` (use `X.sh` or any name but keep `.sh` extension).\n\n2. Edit the new config file `vim X.sh`\n\n3. Run the new instance with `./X.sh` or to run in the background, use `K=X.sh make start`. To attach to the new instance\'s screen, use `K=X.sh make screen`. To stop the new instance, use `K=X.sh make stop` and to restart it, use `K=X.sh make restart`. The environment variable `K` specifies the filename of the config file that you want to use.\n\n4. Open in the web browser the different pages of the ports of the different running instances, or display the UI of all instances together in a single page using the MATRYOSHKA link in the footer (that can be predefined using the optional argument `--matryoshka=URL`).\n\nAfter multiple config files are setup, to control them all together instead of one by one, the commands `make startall`, `make stopall` and `make restartall` are also available, just remember that config files with a filename starting with underscore symbol "_" will be skipped.\n\n### Application Usage\n\n1. Open your web browser to connect to HTTPS port `3000` (or your configured port number) of the machine running K. If you\'re running K locally on Mac/Windows on Docker, replace "localhost" with the address returned by `boot2docker ip`.\n\n2. Read up on how to use K and market making in the [manual](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md).\n\n3. Use the web UI to change the quoting parameters. Click the "BTC/USD" button to start making markets. Click it again to stop. When the button is green, the bot is actively placing orders.\n\n### Web UI\n\nOnce `K` is up and running, visit HTTPS port `3000` (or your configured port number) to access the UI (i.e. [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)). There are inputs for quoting parameters, grids to display market orders, market trades, your trades, your order history, your positions, and a big button with the currency pair you are trading. When you\'re ready, click that button green to begin sending out quotes. The UI uses angularjs hydrated with websockets observed with reactivexjs.\n\nIf you want to generate your own certificate see [SSL for internal usage](https://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html).\n\nIn case you really want to use plain HTTP, use `--without-ssl` argument.\n\n### Databases\n\nEach currency pair of each exchange will use a different sqlite database file with [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) enabled.\n\nAll database files are located at `/var/lib/K/db/K-*.db*`, outside the download folder to survive wild `rm -rf path/to/K` or reinstalls.\n\nYou can copy any group of `*.db*` files to another machine when migrating or as a backup.\n\nIf a database does not exist, the application will create it on boot; otherwise, it will use the existing one.\n\nTo explore each database you can use https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser or a similar tool.\n\nTo set a different database filename or to set an [in-memory database](https://sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html), use `--database=FILE` argument (see `--help`).\n\nEven if using an in-memory database, the quoting parameters are always loaded from and saved into the disk file database.\n\n### Charts\n\nThe metrics are not saved anywhere, it is just UI data collected with a visibility retention of `n` hours (where `n` is the value of `profit` quoting parameter), to display over time:\n\n * Market Fair Value with High and Low Prices\n * Trades Complete\n * Target Position for BTC currency (TBP)\n * Target Position for Fiat currency\n * STDEV and EWMA values for Quote Protection and APR\n * Amount available in wallet for buy\n * Amount held in open trades for buy\n * Amount available in wallet for sell\n * Amount held in open trades for sell\n * Total amount available and held at both sides in BTC currency\n * Total amount available and held at both sides in Fiat currency\n\n### Cloud Hosting\n\nIf you ask me, [<img height="20px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1634027/29756933-3e64c62e-8ba8-11e7-916a-3b0ae1481a52.png">](https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?475987/cloud/) is a very nice web hosting company (awesome support team, awesome servers). Feel free to use this referral link to get a discount subtracted from my referral earnings (i\'m a user since 2008).\n\n### Build notes\n\nMake sure your build machine has [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) installed, and also ensure `make dist` provides all dependencies without errors.\n\nTo rebuild the application with your modifications, see `make help` and choose a target (just `make` may be what you are looking for).\n\nTest units are executed before the application exits, only if the application was compiled with `KUNITS=1 make`.\n\nOtherwise, just `make` without the environment var `KUNITS` produces an application that simply exits on exit.\n\nA quick test runner therefore is `./K.sh --version` or the alias `make test` or all at once with `KUNITS=1 make K test`.\n\nTo pipe the output to stdout, execute the application in the foreground with `./K.sh --naked`.\n\nTo ignore the output, execute the application in the background with `screen -dmS K K.sh` or with the alias `make start` or simply `./K.sh`.\n\nFor more information consider to follow the *white rabbit*, but its dangerous to go alone, take this:\n\nc sandbox: [wandbox.org](https://wandbox.org)\n\njs sandbox: [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net)\n\nws sandbox: [websocket.org](https://www.websocket.org/echo.html)\n\n<details><summary><a id="unreleased-changelog"><b>Release v0.5.x Changelog</b></a></summary>\n\nUpdated exchange integrations as simple libcurl wrappers.\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><b>Release v0.4.x Changelog</b></summary>\n\nAdded main KryptoNinja class derived from all other classes and ready to be extended.\n\nAdded C++ OOP everywhere.\n\nAdded test units.\n\nAdded --interface=IP argument to bind outgoing traffic to a specific network interface.\n\nAdded Ethfinex and FCoin API.\n\nAdded build-in document root to stop reading files from disk.\n\nAdded build chain for win32.\n\n~~Updated OKEx websocket to binary data.~~\n\nAdded build chain for OSX v10.13.\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><b>Release v0.3.x Changelog</b></summary>\n\nUpdated HitBTC API v2.\n\nAdded ZIP installation steps for non-git-lovers.\n\nAdded HamelinRat quoting mode and Trend safety thanks to b-seite and serzhiio contributions.\n\nAdded command-line arguments.\n\nUpdated quoting engine and gateways without nodejs.\n\nAdded Makefile to replace npm scripts.\n\n~~Added PNG files as configuration files.~~\n\nAdded built-in C++ WWW Server to replace expressjs and socketio.\n\nAdded built-in SQLite C++ interface to replace external mongodb server.\n\nAdded Poloniex API.\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><b>Release v0.2.x Changelog</b></summary>\n\nUpdated application name to K because of Kira.\n\nAdded nodejs7, typescript2, angular4 and reactivexjs.\n\nAdded cleanup of bandwidth, source code, dependencies and installation steps.\n\nAdded many quoting parameters thanks to Camille92 genius suggestions.\n\nAdded support for multiple instances/config files with nested matryoshka UI.\n\nAdded npm scripts, david-dm, travis-ci, coveralls and codacy.\n\nAdded historical charts to replace grafana.\n\nAdded C++ math functions.\n\nUpdated OKCoin API (since https://www.okcoin.com/t-354.html).\n\nUpdated Bitfinex API v2.\n\nAdded Coinbase FIX API.\n\n~~Added Korbit API.~~\n\nAdded new quoting styles PingPong, Boomerang, AK-47.\n\nAdded cleanup of database records, memory usage and log recording.\n\nAdded audio notices, realtime wallet display, and grafana integration.\n\nAdded https, dark theme and new UI elements.\n\nAdded a bit of love to Kira.\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><b>Release v0.1.0 Changelog</b></summary>\n\nsee the upstream project [michaelgrosner/tribeca](https://github.com/michaelgrosner/tribeca).\n</details>\n\n### Unlock\n\nThe bot is unlocked for collaborators and contributors (feel free to make acceptable Pull Requests for already opened issues or for anything you consider useful, and let me know the BTC Payment Address for the bot that you wish to unlock in the description of the PR, and I will credit it for you).\n\nWhile locked, the orderbook will be not in realtime, instead market price levels will be updated only once every 7 seconds.\n\nAnonymous users can also unlock any API Key by paying 0.01210000 BTC to the address displayed.
