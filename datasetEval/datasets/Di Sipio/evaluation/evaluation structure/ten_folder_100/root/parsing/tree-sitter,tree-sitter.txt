It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:\n\n* **General** enough to parse any programming language\n* **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor\n* **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors\n* **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application\n\n[Documentation](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)\n'
