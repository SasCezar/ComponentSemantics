ReSharper has been not only a tool we couldn\'t do without; it\'s been an inspiration, the ultimate level of polished perfection to strive for in our own IDE add-in project. So just like you\'re missing out if you write VBA and you\'re not using Rubberduck, you\'re missing out if you write C# and aren\'t using ReSharper.\n\n<sub>Note: Rubberduck is not a JetBrains product.
