b'# Alma [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/masak/alma.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/masak/alma)\n\nAlma is a small language created as a testbed for Perl 6 macros. Its goal as a\nlanguage is to inform the implementation of macros in Perl 6, by means of being\na faster-moving code base and easier to iterate on towards good solutions.\n\nRakudo already contains a rudimentary implementation of macros, but at this\npoint the most mature macro implementation for Perl 6 is embodied in Alma.\n\nAlma was previously known as "007", in reference to the "Q" data structure\nwhich represents program fragments.\n\n## Get it\n\nIf you\'re just planning to be a Alma end user, `zef` is the recommended way to\ninstall Alma:\n\n```sh\nzef install alma\n```\n\n(If you want to install from source, see [the\ndocumentation](http://masak.github.io/alma/#installation-from-source).)\n\n### Run it\n\nNow this should work:\n\n```sh\n$ alma -e=\'say("OH HAI")\'\nOH HAI\n\n$ alma examples/format.alma\nabracadabra\nfoo{1}bar\n```\n\n## Status\n\nAlma is currently in development.\n\nThe explicit goal is to reach some level of feature completeness for macros in\nAlma, and then to backport that solution to Rakudo.\n\n## Useful links\n\n* [Documentation](http://masak.github.io/alma/) (\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7  under construction \xf0\x9f\x94\xa7 )\n* [examples/ directory](https://github.com/masak/alma/tree/master/examples)\n* The [Roadmap](https://github.com/masak/alma/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) outlines short- and long-term goals of the Alma project\n\nTo learn more about macros:\n\n* [Hague grant application: Implementation of Macros in Rakudo](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2011/09/hague-grant-application-implem.html)\n* [Macros progress report: after a long break](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/macros-progress-report-after-a-long-break)\n* [Macros: what the FAQ are they?](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/macros-what-the-faq-are-they)\n\nTo learn more about Alma:\n\n* [Double oh seven](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/double-oh-seven) blog post\n* [Has it been three years?](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/has-it-been-three-years) blog post\n* This README.md used to contain a [pastiche of the cold open in Casino Royale (2006)](https://github.com/masak/alma/tree/master/documentation/bond-pastiche.md), which was entertaining for some and confusing for others\n'
