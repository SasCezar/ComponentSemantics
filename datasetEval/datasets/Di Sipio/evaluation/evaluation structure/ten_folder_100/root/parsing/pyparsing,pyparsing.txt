b'PyParsing -- A Python Parsing Module\n====================================\n\n|Build Status| |Coverage|\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThe pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and\nexecuting simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the\nuse of regular expressions. The pyparsing module provides a library of\nclasses that client code uses to construct the grammar directly in\nPython code.\n\n*[Since first writing this description of pyparsing in late 2003, this\ntechnique for developing parsers has become more widespread, under the\nname Parsing Expression Grammars - PEGs. See more information on PEGs at*\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar *.]*\n\nHere is a program to parse ``"Hello, World!"`` (or any greeting of the form\n``"salutation, addressee!"``):\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from pyparsing import Word, alphas\n    greet = Word(alphas) + "," + Word(alphas) + "!"\n    hello = "Hello, World!"\n    print(hello, "->", greet.parseString(hello))\n\nThe program outputs the following::\n\n    Hello, World! -> [\'Hello\', \',\', \'World\', \'!\']\n\nThe Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to the\nself-explanatory class names, and the use of \'+\', \'|\' and \'^\' operator\ndefinitions.\n\nThe parsed results returned from ``parseString()`` can be accessed as a\nnested list, a dictionary, or an object with named attributes.\n\nThe pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically\nvexing when writing text parsers:\n\n- extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle ``"Hello,World!"``, ``"Hello , World !"``, etc.)\n- quoted strings\n- embedded comments\n\nThe examples directory includes a simple SQL parser, simple CORBA IDL\nparser, a config file parser, a chemical formula parser, and a four-\nfunction algebraic notation parser, among many others.\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nThere are many examples in the online docstrings of the classes\nand methods in pyparsing. You can find them compiled into online docs\nat https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Additional\ndocumentation resources and project info are listed in the online\nGitHub wiki, at https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/wiki.
