It scrapes the website to satisfy the need for an API - which MyAnimeList lacks.\n\nThe raison d\'\xc3\xaatre of Jikan is to assist developers easily get the data they need for their apps and projects without having to depend on the lackluster official API, unstable APIs, or sidetracking their projects to develop parsers.\n\nThe word _Jikan_ literally translates to _Time_ in Japanese (**\xe6\x99\x82\xe9\x96\x93**). And that\'s what this API saves you of. ;)\n\n\n**Notice**: Jikan does not support authenticated requests. You can not update your lists.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n1. `composer require jikan-me/jikan`\n2.
