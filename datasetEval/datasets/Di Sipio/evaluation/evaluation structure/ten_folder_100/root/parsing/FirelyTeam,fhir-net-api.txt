Depending on the version of FHIR you require, you'll find the relevant links to the packages\nand develop branches in this repository below:\n\n|Spec version|Git branch|Core NuGet|\n|---|---|---|\n|R4|https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api/tree/develop-r4|https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hl7.Fhir.R4/|\n|STU3|https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api/tree/develop-stu3|https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hl7.Fhir.STU3/|\n|DSTU 2.1|N/A|https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hl7.Fhir.DSTU21/|\n|DSTU2| https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api/tree/develop|https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hl7.Fhir.DSTU2/|\n|DSTU1| https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api/tree/master-dstu1|https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hl7.Fhir.DSTU/|\n\nPlease note that the source code for the FHIR .NET API is split up into two GitHub repo's: one (with the branches listed above) with code that is specific to a FHIR release (this repo), and one that contains the code that is applicable across all FHIR releases (a separate [common repository][common-repo]).  This second repository is included in the first one using a Git Submodule, so all you have to do is check out the main repo (this one) and learn how to work with Submodules.\n\n## Support \nWe actively monitor the issues coming in through the GitHub repository at [https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api/issues](https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api/issues). You are welcome to register your bugs and feature suggestions there. For questions and broader discussions, we use the .NET FHIR Implementers chat on [Zulip][netapi-zulip].\n\n## Contributing ##\nWe are welcoming contributors!\n\nIf you want to participate in this project, we're using [Git Flow][nvie] for our branch management, so please submit your commits using pull requests on the correct `develop`/`develop-stu3`/`develop-r4` branches as mentioned above! \n\n[common-repo]: https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-common\n[netapi-docu]: http://docs.simplifier.net/fhirnetapi/index.html\n[netapi-zulip]: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/dotnet\n[nvie]: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/\n[fhir-spec]: http://www.hl7.org/fhir\n[dstu1-spec]: http://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU1/index.html\n[dstu2-spec]: http://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/index.html\n[stu3-spec]: http://www.hl7.org/fhir\n[r4-spec]: http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html\n[fhirpath-spec]: http://hl7.org/fhirpath/\n\n### GIT branching strategy \n- [NVIE](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)\n- Or see: [Git workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-gitflow)\n"
