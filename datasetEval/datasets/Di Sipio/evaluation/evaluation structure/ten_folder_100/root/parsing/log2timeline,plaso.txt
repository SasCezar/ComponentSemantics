b'## plaso (Plaso Langar A\xc3\xb0 Safna \xc3\x96llu)\n\n*super timeline all the things*\n\nIn short, plaso is a Python-based backend engine for the tool \n[log2timeline](http://plaso.kiddaland.net "Plaso home of the super timeline").\n\n### A longer version\n\nlog2timeline is a tool designed to extract timestamps from various files found \non a typical computer system(s) and aggregate them.\n\nThe initial purpose of plaso was to collect all timestamped events of interest \non a computer system and have them aggregated in a single place for computer \nforensic analysis (aka Super Timeline).\n\nHowever plaso has become a framework that supports:\n\n* adding new parsers or parsing plug-ins;\n* adding new analysis plug-ins;\n* writing one-off scripts to automate repetitive tasks in computer forensic analysis or equivalent.\n\nAnd is moving to support:\n\n* adding new general purpose parses/plugins that may not have timestamps associated to them;\n* adding more analysis context;\n* tagging events;\n* allowing more targeted approach to the collection/parsing.\n\n### Project status\n\n[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) | [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com) | [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) | [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org)\n--- | --- | --- | --- \n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/log2timeline/plaso.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/log2timeline/plaso) | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/7slp4uexetn8bomg?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/log2timeline/plaso) | [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/log2timeline/plaso/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/log2timeline/plaso) | [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/plaso/badge/?version=latest)](https://plaso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)  \n\n### Also see\n\n* [Homepage](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso)\n* [Downloads](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/releases)\n* [Documentation](https://plaso.readthedocs.io)\n\n'
