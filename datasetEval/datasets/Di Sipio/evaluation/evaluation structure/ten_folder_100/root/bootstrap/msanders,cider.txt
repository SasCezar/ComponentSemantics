b'## Start with a clean slate\n\nCider is a simple wrapper for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io) that allows you to save your setup across different machines. This lets you to restore a backup without having to deal with the mess that was the state of your previous installation, or painstakingly babysit the process step-by-step.\n\nSimply run the following on a new machine:\n\n    git clone [YOUR_REPO] ~/.cider\n    cider restore\n\n\n... and you\'ll be back up and running, with all of your applications and command line utilities re-installed (and configurations restored).\n\n\nIn addition to Homebrew, Cider also supports managing your user defaults, restoring symlinks, and running scripts to conveniently manage other settings such as your dotfiles.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nCider is available directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cider):\n\n    pip install -U cider\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nAll configuration files are stored in the `~/.cider` directory as JSON. For instance, here\'s an example bootstrap file:\n\n    {\n        "after-scripts": [\n            "brew linkapps"\n        ],\n        "casks": [\n            "adobe-creative-cloud",\n            "dropbox",\n            "firefox",\n            "flash",\n            "flux",\n            "github",\n            "google-chrome",\n            "google-hangouts",\n            "heroku-toolbelt",\n            "iterm2",\n            "mplayerx",\n            "sublime-text",\n            "transmission",\n        ],\n        "formulas": [\n            "brew-cask",\n            "emacs",\n            "fish",\n            "git",\n            "go",\n            "macvim --overwrite-system-vi",\n            "python",\n            "python3",\n            "xctool"\n        ],\n\t\t"icons": {\n\t\t\t"iTerm": "https://dribbble.com/shots/1702947-iTerm-Replacement-Icon/attachments/271548"\n\t\t},\n\t\t"symlinks": {\n\t\t\t"bash/.*": "~",\n\t\t\t"bin/*": "~/bin/",\n\t\t\t"git/.*": "~",\n\t\t\t"sh/.*": "~",\n\t\t\t"vim/.*": "~"\n\t\t},\n        "taps": [\n            "caskroom/cask"\n        ]\n    }\n\nUser defaults are stored similarly:\n\n    {\n        "NSGlobalDomain": {\n            "ApplePressAndHoldEnabled": false\n        },\n        "com.apple.dock": {\n            "tilesize": 48\n        },\n        "com.iconfactor.mac.xScope": {\n            "generalShowDockIcon": false\n        }\n    }\n\nCider also supports YAML if you\'d like to add comments to either of these. To see how this works out in practice, feel free to take a look at [my dotfiles](https://github.com/msanders/dotfiles).\n\n## Backup your existing setup\n\nTo save the state of your existing setup:\n\n    cider missing\n    cider tap missing\n    cider cask missing\n\n## Manage symlinks\n\nCider supports the following commands to manage symlinks (inspired in part by [GNU Stow](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html)).\n\n    cider addlink NAME ITEM...\n    cider relink # (invoked automatically by restore)\n\nFor example, `cider addlink git ~/.gitconfig` will move `~/.gitconfig` to `~/.cider/symlinks/git/`, create a link back to its original location, and add an entry to your bootstrap denoting this:\n\n    "symlinks": {\n        "git/.*": "~"\n    }\n\nTo undo this change, simply run `cider unlink git`.\n\nDirectories in targets are automatically expanded, so the entry `"bin/*": "~/bin/"` will first create the directory `~/bin/` if it doesn\'t exist already, and then link all items in `symlinks/bin/*` to children of that directory.\n\n## Caveats\n\nThere doesn\'t seem to be a way to re-install purchases made from Mac App Store via the command line just yet, so those have to be done by hand.\n\n**Note**: Cider is a work-in-progress, but it\'s well-tested and should be kind to your machine.\n'
