b'**CoPilot** is a fully responsive admin template that is forked from [AdminLTE](https://almsaeedstudio.com). The difference here is that this repo is tailored to use with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). The UI is based on the [Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) framework. Highly customizable and easy to use. Fits many screen resolutions from small mobile devices to large desktops.\n\n<a href="https://copilot.misterGF.io" target="_blank">\xe2\x9c\x88\xef\xb8\x8f\xef\xb8\x8f Take it for a spin.</a>\n\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/misterGF/CoPilot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/misterGF/CoPilot)\n[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/wenct56narbt6r1l?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/misterGF/copilot)\n\n!["CoPilot Screenshot"](http://res.cloudinary.com/gatec21/image/upload/v1489954238/copilot-march-2017_ifdrlj.png)\n\nIn an attempt to keep the project clean I have not included every plugin/feature that AdminLTE offers. You simply need to add the plugin in the /static/js/plugin folder to include them or use npm. I\'ve included the popular ones.\n\nThe structure of the app is scaffolded by [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). Which is a simple CLI tool that setups our environment. CoPilot uses the webpack package. So we get a full-featured Webpack + vue-loader setup with hot reload, linting, testing & css extraction.\n\nWe leverage all the goodies that vue.js offers. Vue-Router for routing. Vue-Resource for AJAX calls. Vuex for state management. **This project is using VueJS 2.0!** Earlier versions can be found under the [vue 1.0 branch](https://github.com/misterGF/CoPilot/tree/vue1.0_version).\n\nI also recommend that you install vue-devtools for Chrome so that you can easily inspect that state of vue.\n![vue-devtools](http://res.cloudinary.com/gatec21/image/upload/v1461611064/copilot-vuetools_t1mvpg.png)\n\nThe data that is being pulled uses faker.js to make it dynamic. This is for demo purposes. Look for demo.* for information that is generated dynamically.\n\nInstallation\n------------\nInstalling CoPilot is easy.\n\n#### Download:\n\nDownload from Github\n\n#### Using The Command Line:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/misterGF/CoPilot.git\n```\n\n\n#### Build Setup\n\n``` bash\n# install dependencies\nsudo npm install\n\n# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080\nnpm run dev\n\n# build for production with minification\nnpm run build\n\n# run unit tests\nnpm run unit\n\n# run e2e tests\nnpm run e2e\n\n# run all tests\nnpm test\n```\n\nFor detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack#vue-webpack-boilerplate) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nDepending on the component you are working on you should have the following links handy.\n\n- AdminLTE - [online documentation](https://almsaeedstudio.com/themes/AdminLTE/documentation/index.html)\n- BootStrap 3 - [online documentation](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)\n- Vue.js - [online documentation](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)\n- ~~Vue-Resource~~ - No longer supported\n- Axios - [online documentation](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)\n- Vue-Router - [online documentation](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router)\n- Vuex - [online documentation](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex)\n\nInformation and tips about CoPilot can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/misterGF/CoPilot/wiki).\n\nBrowser Support\n---------------\n- IE 9+\n- Firefox (latest)\n- Chrome (latest)\n- Safari (latest)\n- Opera (latest)\n\nContribution\n------------\nContribution are always **welcome and recommended**!
