b'# Bootstrap 3 for IE7\n\n[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coliff/bootstrap-ie7/master/LICENSE)\n[![Tip Me via PayPal](https://img.shields.io/badge/PayPal-tip%20me-green.svg?logo=paypal)](https://www.paypal.me/coliff)\n[![github-stars-image](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/coliff/bootstrap-ie7.svg?label=github%20stars)](https://github.com/coliff/bootstrap-ie7)\n\nBootstrap 3 dropped support for Internet Explorer 7, but you can add it back by simply adding this conditional CSS.\n\n```html\n<!--[if lt IE 8]>\n    <link href="/css/bootstrap-ie7.css" rel="stylesheet">\n<![endif]-->\n```\n\n### Requirements\n\n* Bootstrap 3 uses the box-sizing property for layouts which is not natively supported by IE7. The polyfill \'boxsizing.htc\' is required: https://github.com/Schepp/box-sizing-polyfill\n\n### What does this fix?\n\n* Glyphicons do not display\n* Layout issues (with border-box via the `boxsizing.htc` polyfill)\n* `.list-group-item` displays incorrectly with bullet points\n* [Haslayout](https://www.sitepoint.com/internet-explorer-haslayout-property/) bug\n* `.dropdown-menu .divider` not displaying\n* `.sr-only` clip syntax\n* hr margin top and margin bottom spacing fix\n\n### What does this not fix?\n\n* Percentage width rounding issue [Info](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1309964/how-to-fix-internet-explorer-7-bug-when-using-percentage-widths-for-layout?answertab=active#tab-top)\n* As this is only a CSS stylesheet there may be problems with using Bootstrap 3\'s JavaScript in IE7.\n* Some elements rely on pseudo-selectors which IE7 does not support (first-child, last-child etc) \n\n### FAQS\n\n* Q. Do I need to make any changes to my HTML to add support for bootstrap3-ie7?\n\n  A. Nope! Just include the conditional IE7 stylesheet and you\'re ready to go!\n\n* Q. Does this include the new Glyphicons introduced in Bootstrap 3.3.2?\n\n  A. Yep!\n\n* Q. What about rounded corners, box shadows and gradients for IE7. How can I get those?\n\n  A. You could use CCS3Pie for adding support for those CSS3 properties to older IE. http://css3pie.com/.\n  If you use that you can add this to your CSS to quickly add border-radius https://gist.github.com/coliff/5618329\n\n* Q. Is the CSS available on a CDN?\n\n  A. Yes, thanks to JSDelivr: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/coliff/bootstrap-ie7/css/bootstrap-ie7.min.css, however the box sizing polyfill requires the CSS to be hosted locally so the layout will be broken if you serve the CSS from a CDN.\n\n* Q. What about Internet Explorer 6?\n\n  A. Although this CSS does not include IE6-specific fixes, it does fix the webfonts icon, so it\'s worthwhile using the conditional code `if lt IE 8` rather than `if IE 7`.\n\n* Q. What about Bootstrap 4?\n\n  A. I\'ve created a couple of stylesheets for Internet Explorer 8 and 9 to add support for Bootstrap 4. Check it out at: https://github.com/coliff/bootstrap-ie8\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n* The boxsizing.htc polyfill can be a little bit buggy. Please make sure you follow the instructions for using that carefully.\n'
