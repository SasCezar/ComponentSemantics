The whole pipeline is shared and free to use for any purpose. You could be spinning your own icon font with your clever name by just forking this project and changing a few settings.\n\n## How to use\nThere is a full page in our documentation website that explains [how to use Fork Awesome in your web project](https://forkaweso.me/Fork-Awesome/get-started/).
