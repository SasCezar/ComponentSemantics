Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\n\n## Code scaffolding\n\nRun `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.\n\n## Build\n\nRun `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.\n\n### Build for Production\n\nRun `npm run build:prod` to build the project minified for production with AOT.\n\n## Configure api keys\n\nEchoes use environment variables to integrate Google Analytics, youtube data api key and youtube client id for authorization.\nThese defiend as template variables, and are replaced after a successfull build with build-env.js.\n\n### Youtube Keys\n\nGenerate your own keys via [google\'s console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)\nRequired Keys are:  \n`API Key`  \n`OAuth client ID`\n\n### Analytics Key (Optional)\n\nThe key is the project ID usually can be retreived from the analytics Admin interface. it exist as part of the "script" to paste in your html file.\n\n## Running unit tests\n\nRun `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).  \nRun `npm run test:ci` to execute the unit tests only **Once**\n\n## Running end-to-end tests\n\nRun `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).\nBefore running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.\n\n## Further help\n\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).\n\n# Bundle analyze explorer\n\n[look at issue](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/4172)\n\n1.  make sure `npm i source-map-explorer -g`\n1.  `ng build --prod --aot --sm` (the sourcemap is for later steps)\n1.  `cd dist && source-map-explorer A-FILE-WITH-HASH.js`\n'
