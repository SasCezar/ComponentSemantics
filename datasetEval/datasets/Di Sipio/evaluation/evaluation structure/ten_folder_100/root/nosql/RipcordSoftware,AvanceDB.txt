AvanceDB has blistering fast document lookup and map/reduce performance. If you are currently using CouchDB and struggle with view build times then AvanceDB should be a seamless replacement for your view workload.\n\nWe aim to support the following CouchDB features:\n* Futon and Fauxton\n* JavaScript Map/Reduce\n* Replication\n* Apache Lucene and ElasticSearch integration\n* Compatibility with common CouchDB clients like Cradle, Nano and others\n* Compatibility with PouchDB\n\nAvanceDB is not designed to replace CouchDB for document storage. We have permanent document store functionality on the product roadmap but we are unlikely to realize this feature for quite a while.\n\nThe core is written in C++ 11 with Boost and map/reduce executed by an embedded SpiderMonkey JSAPI instance. We chose C++ because it is very fast and gives control over memory allocations that simply isn't available with managed languages like Java and C#.\n\nAvanceDB will run on Linux on a humble Raspberry Pi 2 or an enterprise server. Via the magic of [Brew](http://brew.sh/) you can spin up an instance of AvanceDB on OSX too. If you are running Windows you are out of luck, at least for the moment.\n\n## Build Status\n\n| OS           | Architecture       | Status                       |\n|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------|\n| Debian 8.6   | i386               | [![debian-8.6-i386](https://jenkins-i386.ripcordsoftware.com/buildStatus/icon?job=avancedb-debian-i386-8.6)](https://jenkins-i386.ripcordsoftware.com/job/avancedb-debian-i386-8.6/) |\n| Debian 8.6   | amd64              | [![debian-8.6-amd64](https://jenkins.ripcordsoftware.com/buildStatus/icon?job=avancedb-debian-8.6)](https://jenkins.ripcordsoftware.com/job/avancedb-debian-8.6/) |\n| Ubuntu 14.04 | amd64              | [![ubutu-14.04-amd64](https://jenkins.ripcordsoftware.com/buildStatus/icon?job=avancedb-ubuntu-14.04)](https://jenkins.ripcordsoftware.com/job/avancedb-ubuntu-14.04/) |\n| Ubuntu 16.04 | amd64              | [![ubuntu-16.04-amd64](https://jenkins.ripcordsoftware.com/buildStatus/icon?job=avancedb-ubuntu-16.04)](https://jenkins.ripcordsoftware.com/job/avancedb-ubuntu-16.04/) |\n| CentOS 6.8   | amd64              | [![centos-6.8-amd64](https://jenkins.ripcordsoftware.com/buildStatus/icon?job=avancedb-centos-6.8)](https://jenkins.ripcordsoftware.com/job/avancedb-centos-6.8/) |\n| CentOS 7.3   | amd64              | [![centos-7.3-amd64](https://jenkins.ripcordsoftware.com/buildStatus/icon?job=avancedb-centos-7.3)](https://jenkins.ripcordsoftware.com/job/avancedb-centos-7.3/) |\n| Fedora 25    | amd64              | [![fedora-25-amd64](https://jenkins.ripcordsoftware.com/buildStatus/icon?job=avancedb-fedora-25)](https://jenkins.ripcordsoftware.com/job/avancedb-fedora-25/) |\n| FreeBSD 11   | amd64              | [![freebsd-11-amd64](https://jenkins-bsd.ripcordsoftware.com/buildStatus/icon?job=avancedb-freebsd-11)](https://jenkins-bsd.ripcordsoftware.com/job/avancedb-freebsd-11/) |\n\n## Installing\nYou can run AvanceDB under [Docker](https://www.docker.com) on Linux or Mac or [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) on Mac.\n\nWe plan to release RPM and DEB packages for CentOS/RHEL and Debian/Ubuntu at some point in the future.\n\n### Docker\nInstall Docker if you don't already have it installed. Make sure it is running properly by spinning up the `hello-world` container, then you are go:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 5994:5994 ripcordsoftware/avancedb\n```\n\nFire up your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5994/_utils` and you should see the main Futon window.\n\n### Homebrew\nOnce you have `brew` installed you can install AvanceDB with:\n\n```bash\nbrew install autoconf@2.13 && \\\nbrew install autoconf && \\\nbrew install ripcordsoftware/packages/avancedb\n```\n\nTo run AvanceDB as a daemon under `launchd` execute: `sudo brew services start ripcordsoftware/packages/avancedb`.\n\n## Building\nCheck out our [Wiki](https://github.com/RipcordSoftware/AvanceDB/wiki) for information about building AvanceDB on your platform.\n\n## API\nAvanceDB is under active development, you can check out the current API support status [here](https://github.com/RipcordSoftware/AvanceDB/wiki/CouchDB-API-Support).\n\n## Contributing\n### C++\nIf you are a C++ 11 ace with interest in NoSQL and CouchDB specifically then we'd love any contributions you have. Chat to us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/RipcordSoftware/AvanceDB) if you think you can help us out.\n\n### Unit Tests\nWe aim for all major CouchDB clients like [Cradle](https://github.com/flatiron/cradle), [Nano](https://github.com/dscape/nano), [CouchDB-Python](https://github.com/djc/couchdb-python) to operate with AvanceDB. We need unit tests for these platforms, so if you have the language skills and the time and want to contribute then we'd love to hear from you. We hang around on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/RipcordSoftware/AvanceDB) all the time, come over for a chat.\n"
