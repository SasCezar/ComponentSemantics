b'= Neo4j: Graphs for Everyone =\n\nhttps://neo4j.com[Neo4j] is the world\'s leading Graph Database. It is a high performance graph store with all the features expected of a mature and robust database, like a friendly query language and ACID transactions. The programmer works with a flexible network structure of nodes and relationships rather than static tables -- yet enjoys all the benefits of enterprise-quality database. For many applications, Neo4j offers orders of magnitude performance benefits compared to relational DBs.\n\nLearn more on the https://neo4j.com[Neo4j website].\n\n== Using Neo4j ==\n\nNeo4j is available both as a standalone server, or an embeddable component. You can https://neo4j.com/download/[download] or http://console.neo4j.org[try online].\n\n== Extending Neo4j ==\n\nWe encourage experimentation with Neo4j. You can build extensions to Neo4j, develop library or drivers atop the product, or make contributions directly to the product core. You\'ll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement in order for us to accept your patches.\n\n== Dependencies ==\n\nNeo4j is built using http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] version 3.3 and a recent version of supported VM. Bash and Make are also required. Note that maven needs more memory than the standard configuration, this can be achieved with `export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m"`.\n\nOS X users need to have http://brew.sh/[Homebrew] installed.\n\n=== With brew on OS X ===\n\n  brew install maven\n\nPlease note that we do not support building Debian packages on OS X.\n\n=== With apt-get on Ubuntu ===\n\n  apt install maven openjdk-8-jdk\n\nOn top of that, to build Debian packages and Neo4j Desktop:\n\n  apt install debhelper devscripts dos2unix dpkg make xmlstarlet\n  # You will need a license for install4j, which is only needed for Neo4j Desktop\n  curl -O http://download-keycdn.ej-technologies.com/install4j/install4j_linux_6_1_4.deb\n  dpkg -i install4j_linux_6_1_4.deb\n\n== Building Neo4j ==\n\nBefore you start running the unit and integration tests in the Neo4j Maven project on a Linux-like system, you should ensure your limit on open files is set to a reasonable value. You can test it with `ulimit -n`. We recommend you have a limit of at least 40K.\n\n* A plain `mvn clean install` will only build the individual jar files.\n* Test execution is, of course, part of the build.\n* In case you just want the jars, without running tests, this is for you: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`.\n* To build product packages, do `export PATH="bin:$PATH" && make clean all` in the packaging directory after building artifacts with Maven.\n* To build the documentation see the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-documentation/[Neo4j documentation].\n* If you are running into problems building on Windows you can try building Neo4j in a Ubuntu virtual machine.\n* You may need to increase the memory available to Maven: `export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m"`.\n\n== Running Neo4j ==\n\nAfter running a `mvn clean install` cd into `packaging/standalone/target` and extract the version you want, then\n\n  bin/neo4j start\n\nin the extracted folder to start Neo4j on `localhost:7474`. On Windows you want to run\n\n  bin\\neo4j start\n\ninstead.\n\nOr, if you are not interested in the tarballs and just want to run Neo4j you can instead run a `mvn clean install -DminimalBuild` and then cd into `community/server` and run\n\n  mvn clean compile exec:java\n\nto start Neo4j.\n\n== Neo4j Desktop ==\n\nNeo4j Desktop is a convenient way for developers to work with local Neo4j databases.\n\nTo install Neo4j Desktop, go to https://neo4j.com/download-center/[Neo4j Download Center] and follow the instructions. \n\n== Licensing ==\n\nNeo4j Community Edition is an open source product licensed under GPLv3.\n\nNeo4j Enterprise Edition includes additional closed-source components _not available in this repository_ and requires a commercial license from Neo4j or one of its affiliates.\n'
