b"# ToroDB Stampede\n\n> Transform your NoSQL data from a MongoDB replica set into a relational database in PostgreSQL.\n\nThere are other solutions that are able to store the JSON document in a \nrelational table using PostgreSQL JSON support, but it doesn't solve the real \nproblem of 'how to really use that data'. ToroDB Stampede replicates the \ndocument structure in different relational tables and stores the document data\nin different tuples using those tables.\n\n![](documentation/docs/images/tables_distribution.jpeg)\n\n## Installation\n\nDue to the use of different external systems like MongoDB and PostgreSQL, the\ninstallation requires some previous steps. Take a look at out \n[quickstart][1] in the\ndocumentation.\n\n## Usage example\n\nMongoDB is a great idea, but sooner or later some kind of business \nintelligence, or complex aggregated queries are required. At this point MongoDB\nis not so powerful and ToroDB Stampede borns to solve that problem (see \n[our post about that][2]).\n\nThe kind of replication done by ToroDB Stampede allows the execution of \naggregated queries in a relational backend (PostgreSQL) with a noticeable time \nimprovement.\n\nA deeper explanation is available in our \n[how to use][3] section in the \ndocumentation.\n\n## Development setup\n\nAs it was said in the installation section, the requirements of external \nsystems can make more difficult to explain briefly how to setup the development \nenvironment here. So if you want to take a look on how to prepare your \ndevelopment environment, take a look to our \n[documentation][4].\n\n## Release History\n\n* 1.0.0\n    * Released on October 24th 2018\n* 1.0.0-beta3\n    * Released on June 30th 2017\n* 1.0.0-beta2\n    * Released on April 06th 2017\n* 1.0.0-beta1\n    * Released on December 30th 2016\n\n## Meta\n\nToroDB \xe2\x80\x93 [@nosqlonsql](https://twitter.com/nosqlonsql) \xe2\x80\x93 info@8kdata.com\n\nDistributed under the GNU AGPL v3 license.
