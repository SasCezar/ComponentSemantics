b'[![Refills](http://images.thoughtbot.com/bourbon/refills-logo.svg)](http://refills.bourbon.io)\n\n## Components and patterns built with Bourbon and Neat\n\n**Note:** This project is no longer maintained.\n\n- **[Examples & Code Snippets](http://refills.bourbon.io)**\n- **[Changelog](https://github.com/thoughtbot/refills/releases)**\n- **[Issues & Bugs](https://github.com/thoughtbot/refills/issues)**\n\nFollow the [@bourbonsass](https://twitter.com/bourbonsass) Twitter account\nfor updates.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Sass] 3.3+\n- [Bourbon] 5.0+\n- [Neat] < 2.0, >= 1.6 (Refills is not currently compatible with Neat 2.0)\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s recommended that you use [Autoprefixer], as Refills do not come packaged\nwith vendor prefixes.\n\n[Sass]: https://github.com/sass/sass\n[Bourbon]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon\n[Neat]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat\n[Autoprefixer]: https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install Refills\xe2\x80\x99 dependencies: [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon#installation), [Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat#installation) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/download) (if you plan to use any components that require JavaScript).\n\n2. Go to the [Refills website](http://refills.bourbon.io), click \xe2\x80\x9cShow Code\xe2\x80\x9d under the component or pattern that you want and copy-paste it into your project.\n\n3. Customize: Most of the components and patterns have a set of Sass variables that allow you to quickly tweak the look and feel.\n\n## Installation for Ruby on Rails\n\nAlternative to copy-pasting manually, we also have a Refills gem that allows you to add components and patterns via Rake tasks.\n\n1. Add Refills to your Gemfile:\n\n  ```ruby\n  gem "refills", group: :development\n  ```\n\n2. Then run:\n\n  ```bash\n  bundle install\n  ```\n\n3. Use the following Rails generators:\n\n  List all available snippets:\n\n  ```bash\n  rails generate refills:list\n  ```\n\n  Add a snippet:\n\n  ```bash\n  rails generate refills:import SNIPPET\n  ```\n\n  If you want to generate coffeescript instead of javascript, simply add `--coffee`\n\n  ```bash\n  rails generate refills:import SNIPPET --coffee\n  ```\n\n  This copies the snippet\xe2\x80\x99s partial to `app/views/refills`, the stylesheet to `app/assets/stylesheets/refills` and the JavaScript to `app/assets/javascripts/refills`\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nIf your css reset file does not add webkit antialias, add the following code to your Scss file:\n\n```css\nbody {\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n}\n```\n\n## The Bourbon family\n\n- [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon): A lightweight Sass tool set\n- [Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat): A lightweight semantic grid framework for Sass and Bourbon\n- [Bitters](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bitters): Scaffold styles, variables and structure for Bourbon projects\n- [Refills](https://github.com/thoughtbot/refills): Components and patterns built with Bourbon and Neat\n\n## License\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2014\xe2\x80\x932017 [thoughtbot, inc](http://thoughtbot.com).
