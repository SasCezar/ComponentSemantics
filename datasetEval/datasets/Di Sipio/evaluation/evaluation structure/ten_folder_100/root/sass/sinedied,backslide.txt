The `template` directory is needed for `backslide` to transform your Markdown files into HTML presentations.\n\nThen edit the file `presentation.md` to get started.\n\nYou can create as many markdown presentations as you want in the directory, they will all be based on the same template.\n\nIf you want to start a new presentation using your own custom template, you can use `bs init --template <your_template_dir>`.\nYou can also set the environment variable `BACKSLIDE_TEMPLATE_DIR` to change the default template used by `bs init`.\n\n### Making your slides\n\nUse `bs serve` to start a development server with live reload.\nA page will automatically open in your web browser showing all your presentations.\n\nSelect one to see the preview, you can then edit your `.md` file and see the changes immediately as you save the file. Any style change will also be applied live.\n\nSlides are written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), along with some useful **Remark.js** specific additions.\nSee the [Remark.js wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki) for the specific syntax and helpers.\n\n#### Customize style\n\nJust edit the `template/style.scss` file and make changes according to your needs.\nThe base theme already provides some helpful additions.\n\nThe stylesheet is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), but you can use plain CSS instead if you feel like it, as long as you don't change the file extension.\n\n### Exporting your slides as self-contained HTML\n\nUse `bs export` to export all your `.md` files as HTML presentations.\n\nEverything will be inlined in the HTML document (scripts, css, etc) so you don't need a network to show your presentation.\nIf you have images, it's best to include them as [data-uri](https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/) in your markdown, but local images links are inlined too during export.\n\nIf you have set a `title` variable in your document (like this `title: My Awesome Presentation`), it will be used as the HTML document title, otherwise the file name will be used.\n\n> Note: you can strip presenter notes from the exported HTML using the `--strip-notes` option, and remove slide fragments with the `--handouts` option.\n\n### Converting your slides to PDF\n\nUse `bs pdf` to export your all `.md` files as PDF presentations.\n\n> Note: you can remove slide fragements with the `--handouts` option.\n\nThis feature is based on [Decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape/).\n"
