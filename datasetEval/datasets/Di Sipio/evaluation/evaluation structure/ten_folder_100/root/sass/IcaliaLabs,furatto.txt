[Please open a new issue](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/furatto/issues). Before opening any issue, please search for existing issues.\n\nWe recommend you to read the version [milestiones](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/furatto/issues?milestone=2&state=open) if you feel like want to collaborate.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nFuratto's documentation is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and publish thorugh Github pages at [http://icalialabs.github.io/furatto/](http://icalialabs.github.io/furatto/). You should be able to run them locally.\n\n### Running documentation locally\n\n1. You need to install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or run `bundle install`\n2. From the root of the project `furatto/` run `jekyll serve --watch` from the command line, this way if you change any file jekyll will generate that for you.\n3. Open <http://localhost:9001/furatto> and you are good to go.\n\nJekyll is a great way to work with static pages, we definitely recommend you take a look at the [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home).\n\n### Old documentation\n\nWe still provide support for version 1 and 2 as it is a big change from one to another, you can visit the old docs [V1](http://icalialabs.github.io/furatto/old_docs/v1/) and [V2](http://icalialabs.github.io/furatto/old_docs/v2/).\n\nWe encourage you to migrate to version 3 as is a more stable, friendly and extendable version.\n\n## Compiling CSS and JavaScript\n\nFuratto V3 now uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to compile all the Sass code and start working with the framework. Before getting started you need to add the necessary dependencies:\n\n### Installing Grunt\n\nFrom the command line:\n\n1. Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.\n2. Navigate to the root `/furatto` directory, then run `npm install`. npm will look at [package.json](https://github.com/icalialabs/furatto/blob/master/package.json) and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.\n\nIf you need to install npm, or you are not quite sure what it is, here is a quick link for you to get started. [NPM](https://github.com/npm/npm)\n\n### Available Grunt tasks\n\nSome of the grunt tasks are:\n\n#### Build - `grunt`\nThis task will build the whole framework, which means, sass compilation, coffeescript compilation, dist directory creation, compression of files and more.\n\n### Workflow\n\nWe have a very useful workflow to work with Furatto and Grunt:\n\n1. Run `jekyll serve --watch` from the command line on the root folder `furatto/`\n2. In another terminal run `grunt watch`, which will be pending of any change on any coffeescript or sass file. It will compile everything up and deliver it to Jekyll, which by receiving the change will regenerate the necessary files.\n\nWe also include livereload to reload when the watch task is over, for more info refer to the our [Gruntfile](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/furatto/blob/v3.0.0/Gruntfile.js)\n\n## Using Rails?\n\nA gem to integrate with Furatto is well maintain by [@kurenn](https://twitter.com/kurenn), this will help you start coding your front end right away.
