b"# DEPRECATED\nThis project will no longer be maintained. As Zurb Foundation is [no longer in active development ](https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/issues/11767), I would recommend that you base your front-end code on another framework, such as [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com) or [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).\n\nTo all of you who have contributed to FoundationPress over the years:\n**Thank you!**\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Ole Fredrik\n\n\n# FoundationPress\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/olefredrik/foundationpress?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\n[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/olefredrik%2Ffoundationpress.svg)](https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress/releases)\n[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nThis is a starter-theme for WordPress based on Zurb's [Foundation for Sites 6](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html), the most advanced responsive (mobile-first) framework in the world. The purpose of FoundationPress, is to act as a small and handy toolbox that contains the essentials needed to build any design. FoundationPress is meant to be a starting point, not the final product.\n\nPlease fork, copy, modify, delete, share or do whatever you like with this.\n\nAll contributions are welcome!\n\n## Requirements\n\n**This project requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) v6.x.x 11.6.x to be installed on your machine.** Please be aware that you might encounter problems with the installation if you are using the most current Node version (bleeding edge) with all the latest features.\n\nFoundationPress uses [Sass](http://Sass-lang.com/) (CSS with superpowers). In short, Sass is a CSS pre-processor that allows you to write styles more effectively and tidy.\n\nThe Sass is compiled using libsass, which requires the GCC to be installed on your machine. Windows users can install it through [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/), and Mac users can install it through the [Xcode Command-line Tools](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).\n\nIf you have not worked with a Sass-based workflow before, I would recommend reading [FoundationPress for beginners](https://foundationpress.olefredrik.com/posts/tutorials/foundationpress-for-beginners), a short blog post that explains what you need to know.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n### 1. Clone the repository and install with npm\n```bash\n$ cd my-wordpress-folder/wp-content/themes/\n$ git clone https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress.git\n$ cd FoundationPress\n$ npm install\n```\n\n### 2. Configuration\n\n#### YAML config file\nFoundationPress includes a `config-default.yml` file. To make changes to the configuration, make a copy of `config-default.yml` and name it `config.yml` and make changes to that file. The `config.yml` file is ignored by git so that each environment can use a different configuration with the same git repo.\n\nAt the start of the build process a check is done to see if a `config.yml` file exists. If `config.yml` exists, the configuration will be loaded from `config.yml`. If `config.yml` does not exist, `config-default.yml` will be used as a fallback.\n\n#### Browsersync setup\nIf you want to take advantage of [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) (automatic browser refresh when a file is saved), simply open your `config.yml` file after creating it in the previous step, and put your local dev-server address and port (e.g http://localhost:8888) in the `url` property under the `BROWSERSYNC` object.\n\n#### Static asset hashing / cache breaker\nIf you want to make sure your users see the latest changes after re-deploying your theme, you can enable static asset hashing. In your `config.yml`, set ``REVISIONING: true;``. Hashing will work on the ``npm run build`` and ``npm run dev`` commands. It will not be applied on the start command with browsersync. This is by design.  Hashing will only change if there are actual changes in the files.\n\n### 3. Get started\n\n```bash\n$ npm start\n```\n\n### 4. Compile assets for production\n\nWhen building for production, the CSS and JS will be minified. To minify the assets in your `/dist` folder, run\n\n```bash\n$ npm run build\n```\n\n#### To create a .zip file of your theme, run:\n\n```\n$ npm run package\n```\n\nRunning this command will build and minify the theme's assets and place a .zip archive of the theme in the `packaged` directory. This excludes the developer files/directories from your theme like `/node_modules`, `/src`, etc. to keep the theme lightweight for transferring the theme to a staging or production server.\n\n### Project structure\n\nIn the `/src` folder you will find the working files for all your assets. Every time you make a change to a file that is watched by Gulp, the output will be saved to the `/dist` folder. The contents of this folder is the compiled code that you should not touch (unless you have a good reason for it).\n\nThe `/page-templates` folder contains templates that can be selected in the Pages section of the WordPress admin panel. To create a new page-template, simply create a new file in this folder and make sure to give it a template name.\n\nI guess the rest is quite self explanatory. Feel free to ask if you feel stuck.\n\n### Styles and Sass Compilation\n\n * `style.css`: Do not worry about this file. (For some reason) it's required by WordPress. All styling are handled in the Sass files described below\n\n * `src/assets/scss/app.scss`: Make imports for all your styles here\n * `src/assets/scss/global/*.scss`: Global settings\n * `src/assets/scss/components/*.scss`: Buttons etc.\n * `src/assets/scss/modules/*.scss`: Topbar, footer etc.\n * `src/assets/scss/templates/*.scss`: Page template styling\n\n * `dist/assets/css/app.css`: This file is loaded in the `<head>` section of your document, and contains the compiled styles for your project.\n\nIf you're new to Sass, please note that you need to have Gulp running in the background (``npm start``), for any changes in your scss files to be compiled to `app.css`.\n\n### JavaScript Compilation\n\nAll JavaScript files, including Foundation's modules, are imported through the `src/assets/js/app.js` file. The files are imported using module dependency with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as the module bundler.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with modules and module bundling, check out [this resource for node style require/exports](http://openmymind.net/2012/2/3/Node-Require-and-Exports/) and [this resource to understand ES6 modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html).\n\nFoundation modules are loaded in the `src/assets/js/app.js` file. By default all components are loaded. You can also pick and choose which modules to include. Just follow the instructions in the file.\n\nIf you need to output additional JavaScript files separate from `app.js`, do the following:\n* Create new `custom.js` file in `src/assets/js/`. If you will be using jQuery, add `import $ from 'jquery';` at the top of the file.\n* In `config.yml`, add `src/assets/js/custom.js` to `PATHS.entries`.\n* Build (`npm start`)\n* You will now have a `custom.js` file outputted to the `dist/assets/js/` directory.\n\n## Demo\n\n* [Clean FoundationPress install](http://foundationpress.olefredrik.com/)\n* [FoundationPress Kitchen Sink - see every single element in action](http://foundationpress.olefredrik.com/kitchen-sink/)\n\n## Local Development\nWe recommend using one of the following setups for local WordPress development:\n\n* [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) (macOS)\n* [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/download-wampserver-64bits/) (Windows)\n* [LAMP](https://www.linux.com/learn/easy-lamp-server-installation) (Linux)\n* [Local](https://local.getflywheel.com/) (macOS/Windows)\n* [VVV (Varying Vagrant Vagrants)](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) (Vagrant Box)\n* [Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis/)\n\n\n## Tutorials\n\n* [FoundationPress for beginners](https://foundationpress.olefredrik.com/posts/tutorials/foundationpress-for-beginners/)\n* [Responsive images in WordPress with Interchange](http://rachievee.com/responsive-images-in-wordpress/)\n* [Learn to use the _settings file to change almost every aspect of a Foundation site](http://zurb.com/university/lessons/66)\n* [Other lessons from Zurb University](http://zurb.com/university/past-lessons)\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Zurb Foundation Docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/)\n* [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/)\n\n## Showcase\n\n* [Harvard Center for Green Buildings and Cities](http://www.harvardcgbc.org/)\n* [The New Tropic](http://thenewtropic.com/)\n* [Parent-Child Home Program](http://www.parent-child.org/)\n* [Hip and Healthy](http://hipandhealthy.com/)\n* [Franchise Career Advisors](http://franchisecareeradvisors.com/)\n* [Maren Schmidt](http://marenschmidt.com/)\n* [Finnerodja](http://www.finnerodja.se/)\n* [WP Diamonds](http://www.wpdiamonds.com/)\n* [Storm Arts](http://stormarts.fi/)\n* [ProfitGym](http://profitgym.nl/)\n* [Agritur Piasina](http://www.agriturpiasina.it/)\n* [Byington Vineyard & Winery](https://byington.com/)\n* [Show And Tell](http://www.showandtelluk.com/)\n* [Wahl + Case](https://www.wahlandcase.com/)\n* [Morgridge Institute for Research](https://morgridge.org)\n* [Impeach Trump Now](https://impeachdonaldtrumpnow.org/)\n* [La revanche des sites](https://www.la-revanche-des-sites.fr/)\n* [Dyami Wilson](https://dyamiwilson.com)\n* [Madico Solutions](https://madico.com)\n\n>Credit goes to all the brilliant designers and developers out there.
