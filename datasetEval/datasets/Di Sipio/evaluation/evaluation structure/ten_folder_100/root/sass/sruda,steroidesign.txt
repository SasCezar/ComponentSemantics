Our most important references are the most well-known Startups (Airbnb, Medium, Product Hunt, etc) as they have invested a lot of time in analyzing the best practices of design, validation of ideas, calls to action, hook, etc. And over time have been creating standards and trends.\n\n<br>\n\n## Solution\n\nSince many are looking for these sites, we decided to create a skeleton of HTML styles and components based on these big companies, themes that are 100% editable and adaptable to your own palette color or styles, adding your own magic \xf0\x9f\x94\xae!. So that your product remains authentic and unique.\n\n**With this, we do not seek to copy the big companies, but to obtain inspiration and have its base for our own projects.**\n\nThe themes include the basic elements in a website: buttons, labels, links, typography, form elements, box components, search bar, navbars, etc, etc, etc.\n\nContributions are more than welcome.\n\n<br>\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Base Methodology](#base-methodology)\n- [Installation and use](#installation-and-use)\n- [Themes](#themes)\n\t- [Airbnb](https://github.com/sergioruizdavila/startups-themes/blob/master/Airbnb.md) **(Done v.1.0.0)**\n\t- [Medium](#medium) (In Progress)\n\t- [Product Hunt](#product-hunt) (Coming soon)\n\t- [Asana](#asana) (Coming soon)\n\t- [Suggest us the next one](#suggest-us-the-next-one)\n- [License](#license)\n\n<br>\n\n## Base methodology\n\nFor our own components, follow the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method for writing & organising CSS. BEM helps keep our CSS logical and predictable. The naming convention follows this pattern:\n\n```css\n.block {}\n.block__element {}\n.block__element--modifier {}\n```\n\n- ```.block``` represents the higher level of an abstraction or component.\n\n- ```.block__element``` represents a descendent of .block that helps form .block as a whole.\n\n- ```.block--modifier``` represents a different state or version of .block.\n\n### more references:\n\n- [http://getbem.com/introduction/](http://getbem.com/introduction/)\n- [https://www.toptal.com/css/introduction-to-bem-methodology](https://www.toptal.com/css/introduction-to-bem-methodology)\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n\n## Installation and use\n\n<h3 align="center">\n\t<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergioruizdavila/startups-themes/develop/www/assets/images/compare%20themes.png" alt="compare">\n</h3>\n\n<br>\n\n### Install\n\nReally you don\xc2\xb4t need an **\'installation\'**, you just could clone the project, take the \'theme\' folder and you are able to start. The only tools that you need to use these themes are:\n\n- **Sass**\n- **Boostrap v3.3.7** *(to keep row and column structure, but you can feel free to use another library for that, the only issue is that you could see the components examples in index HTML a little bit wrong, because we use bootstrap to arrange each component inside row and column grids).*\n\n<br>\n\n#### If you want to run the demo page, you should follow this steps:\n\n**1:** Install NodeJS v6 or latest (Not sure if there is any problem with previous versions, but this is the one we use).\n\n**2:** On terminal (inside root directory) run the following commands:\n\n1. Clone the project.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/sergioruizdavila/startups-themes.git projectname\n```\n\n2. Install gulp, bower and express components: \n```shell\nnpm install\n```\n\n3. Install basic components such as boostrap, jquery, animate.css:\n```shell\nbower install\n```\n4. Launch a local server in order to see styles guideline:\n```shell\ngulp start\n```\n\n**3:** Open your favorite browser, and browse to:\n\n**http://localhost:8080/**\n\nThere you can see whole styles guidelinein in a demo page.\n\n<br>\n\n\n### How to use?\n\nIt\'s very simple, you have to copy the **theme** folder into your own project, inside you will find all styles organized by **components**, and a folder named **core** which contains all global styles and variables (e.g. main palette, helper classes, font family, etc.).\n\n<h3 align="center">\n\t<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/sergioruizdavila/startups-themes/56d23613/www/assets/images/structure_files.png" alt="structure files">\n</h3>\n\n**The file structure is:**\n\n- ***components:*** A folder containing all styles of each component (buttons, links, forms, paragraphs, inputs, etc.)\n\n- ***core:*** Here are all the base styles of your project, here you find a file named **_global.scss** which contains all the global variables, helper classes, and base classes to reset the styles of some global elements such as the body, H tags, labels, etc.\n\n- ***app.scss:*** This is the parent file which contains a reference to all other styles: \n\n<h3 align="center">\n\t<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/sergioruizdavila/startups-themes/d6b7a6e5/www/assets/images/app_file.png" alt="app file">\n</h3>\n\n- **app.min.css:** It\'s the final result after running a small task in Gulp, compile it, concatenates and minifies every style in a single file. This is the file you should add in the **< head >** html section.\n\n```html\n<! your vendors >\n<link rel="stylesheet" href="/build/css/vendor.min.css">\n\n<! theme styles >\n<link rel="stylesheet" href="/theme/app.css">\n```\n- **app.css**: If you don\'t use Sass or another preprocessor, don\'t worry you can take this file and include it into your own project, and you could use any of the components freely.\n\n<br>\n\nYou can also see examples of all components on **index.html**. You will see all the components organized by groups, you can simply take the component you need, and take it to your own project.\n\nAny questions please write us: [@rosa7082](https://www.twitter.com/rosa7082) & [@seruda](https://www.twitter.com/seruda)\n\n**Enjoy it!**\n\n<br>\n\n## Themes\n\n### Airbnb\nStatus: **[See components (v1.0.0)](https://github.com/sergioruizdavila/startups-themes/blob/master/Airbnb.md)**\n\nWe used this theme in other own project: [http://www.waysily.com](http://www.waysily.com)\n\n<h3 align="center">\n\t<img width="500" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/sruda/steroidesign/967bcd2f/www/assets/images/waysily-example.png" alt="compare">\n</h3>\n\n### Medium\nStatus: ***In Progress***\n\n### Product Hunt \nStatus: ***Coming soon***\n\n### Asana \nStatus: ***Coming soon***\n\n<br>\n\n## Suggest us the next one\n\nWe started working on the themes that we believe would be the most beautiful and complete. But if you want us to start in a more great one, just let us know: [@rosa7082](https://www.twitter.com/rosa7082) & [@seruda](https://www.twitter.com/seruda), or by email: [Rosita](mailto:rosa.alvarez.maza@gmail.com) & [Sergio](mailto:sergioruizdavila@gmail.com).
