Primitive also provides helpful, browser-consistent styling for default HTML elements - buttons, forms, tables, lists, and typography.\r\n\r\n### [View documentation](https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### CSS quick start (easy)\r\n\r\n- [Download the stylesheet](https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive/css/main.css) or use the CDN URL: [https://unpkg.com/primitive-ui/dist/css/main.css](https://unpkg.com/primitive-ui/dist/css/main.css).\r\n- Save the stylesheet and link to it in the head of your project.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/primitive-ui/dist/css/main.css">\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt\'s all set to go and your HTML elements will be given sensible default styling.\r\n\r\n### Sass integration (recommended)\r\n\r\nThe beauty of Primitive is the ease with which you can create unique designs in a beautiful, simple system. Simply clone the repo:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/taniarascia/primitive.git\r\ncd primitive\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd run a Sass watch on the project.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm run sass\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can begin modifying variables in `variables.scss`. This file will define your colors, typography, sizes, breakpoints, buttons, borders, and more. Define all your variables here to keep your project organized. \r\n\r\nYou can view `dist/test.html` or `templates/template.html` to see some example elements as you make changes.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nPrimitive was originally built by [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com) to understand how a responsive CSS framework works from scratch, and how to use Sass, the CSS preprocessor. \r\n\r\nPrimitive makes it incredibly simple to set the foundation for a sustainable styling system. You get the freedom to design your site however you want, with a solid, easy-to-understand underlying framework.\r\n\r\nMany websites have been built with Primitive, such as [taniarascia.com](https://www.taniarascia.com), [Laconia](https://laconia.site), [Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!](http://cafebabareeba.com/), [Shaw\'s Crab House](http://shawscrabhouse.com), [Tokio Pub](http://tokiopub.com/), [Krispy Kreme Pacific Northwest](http://krispykremepacificnw.com/), and more.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\n- Dave Gamache for building [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/), the original inspiration for building Primitive and understanding responsive CSS.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to fork, comment, critique, or submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n- [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis project is open source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).\r\n'
