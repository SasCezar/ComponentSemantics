Fork and/or clone our repository. To use Git from command line, see the [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Fork repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) articles.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-angular-dashboard.git\n```\n\n2. Open your copied repo folder in terminal and install necessary modules with command, make sure that you have installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm):\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n3. Install [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) globally to use its commands in the terminal:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --global @angular/cli\n```\n\n4. Now you are able to run or build the project:\n\nRun `npm start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\n\nRun `npm run build` or `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.\n\n# FEATURES\n\n* Angular\n\n* [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)\n\n* TypeScript\n\n* Responsive dark material design.
