Some of them wouldn\'t let me mix set breakpoints with case-specific values, others wouldn\'t properly handle the CSS OR operator and most of them had a syntax that I found complicated and unnatural.\n\n**include-media** was the result of that experience and it includes all the features I wish I had found before, whilst maintaining a simplistic and natural syntax.\n\n## How to install\n\n- With npm: `npm install include-media`\n- With yarn: `yarn add include-media`\n- With Bower: `bower install include-media`\n- With Rails: `gem \'include_media_rails\'` ([maintained by KaoruDev](https://github.com/KaoruDev/include_media_rails))\n- Manually: get [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eduardoboucas/include-media/master/dist/_include-media.scss)\n\nFinally, include the file in your project using an `@import` statement.\n\n## How to use\n\nExamples can be found [here](http://include-media.com/#features).\n\n## Plugins\n\n- [include-media-export](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media-export) - Reference **include-media** breakpoints in JavaScript.\n- [include-media-columns](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media-columns) - Generate column classes using the [BEMIT naming convention](http://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/), automatically referencing **include-media** breakpoints.\n- [include-media-spread](https://github.com/jackmcpickle/include-media-spread) - Calculates the difference between property values and distributes them through your **include-media** breakpoints.\n- [flex_e_ble](https://github.com/jackmcpickle/flex_e_ble) - Uses your **include-media** breakpoints to create your own flexible class naming structure on top of a `flex` based grid with `inline-block` fallback for IE8+ compatibility.\n- [include-media-grid](https://github.com/tszarzynski/include-media-grid) - An **include-media** plugin for generating grid classes based on the flex display.\n- [im-to-em](https://gist.github.com/eduardoboucas/84144cd85cbd2ad4db1ca8b902585ca0) - A tiny function to convert **include-media** breakpoints from `px` to `em`.\n- [include-media-hidden-classes](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media-hidden-classes) - An **include-media** plugin to generate classes for hiding elements.\n\n## Learn more\n\n- [include-media.com](http://include-media.com)\n- [Documentation](http://include-media.com/documentation/)\n- [Approaches to Media Queries in Sass](https://css-tricks.com/approaches-media-queries-sass/) (CSS-Tricks)\n- [Write Simple, Elegant and Maintainable Media Queries with Sass](http://davidwalsh.name/sass-media-query) (David Walsh blog)\n- [Generating Alternative Stylesheets for Browsers Without @media](http://davidwalsh.name/generating-alternative-stylesheets-browsers-media) (David Walsh blog)\n- [Create Simple Inline Media Queries with include-media](http://webdevstudios.com/2015/05/18/create-simple-inline-media-queries-include-media/) (WebDevStudios)\n- [Breakpoints and Tweakpoints in Sass](http://www.sitepoint.com/breakpoints-tweakpoints-sass/) (SitePoint)\n\n## Related projects\n\n- [include-media-or](https://github.com/Nirazul/include-media-or) - A fork of **include-media** with support for complex queries with logical disjunctions (maintained by [Nirazul](https://github.com/Nirazul)).\n\n## The authors\n\nWe are [Eduardo Bou\xc3\xa7as](https://twitter.com/eduardoboucas) and [Hugo Giraudel](https://twitter.com/hugogiraudel).\n\n## We want to hear from you\n\nWe\'ll be on the lookout for your [issues](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media/pulls) \xe2\x80\x94 but make sure you read [this](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting any code!\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under [the terms of the MIT license](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n'
