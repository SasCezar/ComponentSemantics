They\'re great for prototyping but every time\nyou start a real, front-facing, project with them you have to overwrite lots of designer styles that do nothing to add to the\nfunctionality of the website. That costs developers time and money.\n\n**Responsive BP** has been built with that in mind. It is the result of thousands of hours of real, client driven web development and\ntesting; specifically developed to be as lightweight as possible to prevent the need to undo styles set by the framework itself\nand allow developers to write efficient code and lower costs.\n  \n**Responsive BP is tiny**. The combined output CSS and JavaScript is **only 20.3kb minified and gzipped** but there is a lot of functionality built into the framework with touch, right-to-left language, and accessibility support. \n\nBrowser support covers all evergreen browsers.\n\n## Downloading Responsive BP\n\nSeveral options are available for downloading Responsive:\n\n- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/ResponsiveBP/Responsive/releases/download/4.1.4/responsive.zip).\n- [Download the latest release source](https://github.com/ResponsiveBP/Responsive/archive/4.1.4.zip).\n- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ResponsiveBP/Responsive.git`.\n- Install with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/responsive-bp): `npm install responsive-bp`.\n\n## Documentation\n\nResponsives\' documentation, included in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/ResponsiveBP/Responsive/tree/gh-pages) repo. It is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at [http://responsivebp.com](http://responsivebp.com). The docs may also be run locally.\n\n1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v2.5.2).\n - **If you are running Windows** please read this [unofficial guide](https://github.com/juthilo/run-jekyll-on-windows/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.\n2. From the root `/Responsive` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.\n - Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to view the compiled docs.\n\n\nLearn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContribution is most welcome, that\'s the whole idea! Together as a community we can build a boilerplate for building \nresponsive sites that will ensure that high standards can be delivered across all devices.   \n\nPlease adhere to existing JavaScript and Sass styles though when submitting code and ensure \nthat you test thoroughly on multiple devices.\n\nPlease take a moment to review the [guidelines for contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n* [Bug reports](CONTRIBUTING.md#bugs)\n* [Feature requests](CONTRIBUTING.md#features)\n* [Pull requests](CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)\n\n## Building the Sass and JavaScript\n\nThe build process for Responsive is powered by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). To build Responsive you will need to first install the required plugins using the following commands from the root `/Responsive` directory:\n\n1. `npm install` to install the necessary build dependencies based on the contents of the `package.json` file.\n\nIf you are adding new functionality to the build process use:\n\n    npm install {your_new_build_dependency} --save-dev\n\nThere are three types of build available:\n\n 1. `npm run build` Compiles the framework to the **dist** folder.\n 2. `npm run dev` For development purposes. Compiles the framework to the **dist** folder and watches for further changes\n\n## Authors\n\nJames South [@james_m_south](http://twitter.com/james_m_south) and the Responsive contributors.\n\n## Community\n\nFollow [@responsivebp](http://twitter.com/responsivebp) on Twitter.\nDiscuss Responsive on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ResponsiveBP/Responsive).\n\n### Copyright and license\n\nCopyright 2013-2017 James Jackson-South under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n'
