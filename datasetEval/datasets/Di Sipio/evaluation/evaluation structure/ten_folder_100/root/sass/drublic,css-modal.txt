b'# CSS Modals [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/drublic/css-modal.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/drublic/css-modal)\n\nModals built out of pure CSS\n\nPlease [visit the website](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal) to read more\nabout this project and refer to the [FAQ](FAQ.md) in case of a question.\n\n## What is it\n\n**Built with pure CSS:** CSS Modal is built out of pure CSS. JavaScript is only\nfor sugar. This makes them perfectly accessible.\n\n**Optimized for mobile:** The modals are designed using responsive web design\nmethods. They work on all screen sizes from a small mobile phone up to high\nresolution screens.\n\n**Use as Sass plugin:** You can use CSS Modal as [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)\nplugin and apply it to your custom classes. No need to understand all the code.\n\n**A few other advantages:** Accessible, cross-browser, media-adaptive, small and\nfast!\n\n\n## How to use\n\nPlease be aware that modals get stacked above each other if you open one modal\nfrom within another. You can add a data-attribute `data-stackable="false"` to\nthe modal in order to make it non-stackable.\n\n### Markup\n\nYou need to include the markup and content for modals in your website. This has\na positive effect on SEO. The example code:\n\n```html\n<section class="modal--show" id="modal-text" tabindex="-1"\n        role="dialog" aria-labelledby="modal-label" aria-hidden="true">\n\n    <div class="modal-inner">\n        <header id="modal-label"><!-- Header --></header>\n        <div class="modal-content"><!-- The modals content --></div>\n        <footer><!-- Footer --></footer>\n    </div>\n\n    <a href="#!" class="modal-close" title="Close this modal" data-close="Close"\n        data-dismiss="modal">?</a>\n</section>\n```\n\nThe `id` attribute is the one which identifies the modal. You can link to this\nID from everywhere.\n\n> Please note that the ID cannot include the `/` character since this one is\nneeded for identifying stacked modals.\n\nUsing header and footer is optional. Just remove the tags if you don\'t want them\nin a modal.\n\nYou should leave the link\'s href attribute that way to close the modal in order\nto prevent the page from scrolling to top when clicking on it.\n\nPlease remember to set a unique ID for the header and change the\n`aria-labelledby` attribute to the same value.\n\nYou link to a modal by simply setting the ID to a link element\'s `href` like this:\n\n```html\n<a href="#modal">Modal</a>\n```\n\nIf you want to decouple the modal call from the location\'s hash you need to add\n`data-cssmodal-nohash` to the link.\n\n### JavaScript\n\nAs stated above you don\'t need JavaScript to get a good experience out of CSS\nModals. But there are some issues where JavaScript helps:\n\n* IE 8 compatibility (please include jQuery if you need full compatibility).\n* Pressing escape: If you press <kbd>ESC</kbd> on your keyboard while the modal is visible\nit closes itself. This behavior cannot be achieved with CSS only.\n* Preventing background page from scrolling: If you scroll within the modal and\nyou reach the end you don\'t want the page in the background to scroll. To\nprevent this JavaScript pushes a CSS class selector to the body element.\n* Being accessible: To get the browser\'s focus to the modal and back after\nclosing.\n* Firing events: When a modal opens a custom event is fired called\n`cssmodal:show`. When the modal is hidden, an event called `cssmodal:hide` is\ntriggered.\n* To add this behavior to your website, please include the JavaScript file\nmodal.js right before the closing body-tag:\n\n```html\n<script src="js/modal.js"></script>\n```\n\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThis modal is designed to work on all modern browsers. Unfortunately this does\nnot include Internet Explorer 7 or lower. But we deal with IE 8 \xe2\x80\x93 well,\xe2\x80\xa6 at\nleast it works.\n\nOn mobile Safari for iOS and Android 4+ it is tested pretty well, while Android\n2.3 has some problems (biggest issue\n[is scrolling](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues/4)).\nIt\'s also working on Windows Phone 8.\n\nIn numbers:\n\n* Chrome\n* Firefox\n* Safari 6.x\n* Opera 12+\n* Internet Explorer 8 (functional, include jQuery if you want support for\n  events)\n* Internet Explorer 9+\n* iOS 6\n* Android 2.3 (functional)\n* Android 4.x\n* Windows Phone 8\n\n## Media\n\nPlease be aware that you need to stop playing videos or audio manually after\nhiding the modal. We have [a plugin](plugins/html5video.js) for this though.\n\n## Events\n\nThere is an event `cssmodal:show` fired on the modal itself after the modal is\nshown. Another event `cssmodal:hide` is fired after the modal is hidden.\n\nYou can use the events by subscribing to them as if they were click events or\nsomething. Here is an example using jQuery:\n\n```js\n$(document).on(\'cssmodal:show\', function (event) {\n    console.log(event);\n});\n```\n\nThere events are not fired in IE8. Please be aware of that and use jQuery or\nsomething else to create custom events.\n\n\n## Plugins\n\nWe have a couple for the modal to enhance it:\n\n* Resize - Resizes modal to size of input elements\n* Gallery - A lightbox plugin (in connection with resize)\n* HTML5 Video - Load videos within the modal\n* Maximum Width - Set a custom maximum width on a per-modal basis\n\n\n## Bug reports and feature requests\n\nIf you got something that\'s worth including into the project please\n[open an issue](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues) for further\ndiscussion.\n\nPlease see the [section on contributing](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/#contributing)\non the website.\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis is a project by [Hans Christian Reinl](http://drublic.de).
