b'# Material Dashboard Lite\n\nWelcome to first dark dashboard on the Material Design Lite!\n\n<a target="_blank" href="http://creativeit.io/material-dashboard-lite/"><img src="https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/56af74f7f1b5b81a201453c4/2000x1105/796e1dae05e88ba87162dd8bbf188e65/Darkboard_Showcase_1_3.png"/></a>\n\nIts much more fun with the [demo](http://creativeit.io/material-dashboard-lite/).\n\nMaterial admin template is absolutely free for commercial usage theme, that uses google\'s implementation of material design \xe2\x80\x94 [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io) library. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and aims to be responsive and optimized for cross-device usage. All components are created with CSS (scss), JavaScript (es6), and HTML5.\n\n>**Important**: We are still working on the project and there will be much more awesome, check out our [issues](https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-dashboard-lite/issues) to see what features are coming soon.\n\n# SETUP and USAGE\nThe steps bellow will take you through cloning your own fork, installing dependencies and building:\n\n1. Fork and/or clone our repository. To use Git from command line, see the [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) articles. \n  \n  ```\n    git clone https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-dashboard-lite.git\n  ```\n\n2. Open your copied repo folder in terminal and install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) components with command:\n  \n  ```\n    cd material-dashboard-lite\n    npm install\n  ```\n\n3. Install [bower](http://bower.io/) components with command:\n  \n  ```\n    bower install\n  ```\n\n4. Now you are able to build project with [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/):\n  \n  ```\n    gulp build\n  ```\n\n5. To see the result use command:\n  \n  ```\n    gulp serve\n  ```\n\n# FEATURES\n\n*  [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) via [Material Design Lite](http://getmdl.io)\n\n*  Ecmascript 6 (with [babel](https://babeljs.io/))\n\n*  Responsive dark material design. DARK, Carl!\n\n*  User experience focused\n\n*  [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)\n\n*  [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build\n\n*  [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [NVD3](http://nvd3.org/)\n\n*  MIT License\n\n# Additional\n\nSince the project uses [BEM](http://getbem.com) structure with sass, it can be customized in easy way by editing `src/variables.scss` file. To take effect you must run `gulp build` in terminal again. Also you may want to use `gulp watch`, that will run default command every time you modify any file in source folder. You can use `gulp default`if you don\'t want to minify js-files.\n\nGoogle hasn\'t implemented select element yet ([see why here](http://37.media.tumblr.com/6a9fcffde2da977266b0ea99b15d5803/tumblr_n42cjjsriB1smcbm7o1_400.gif)), that is why the project depends on [getmdl-select plugin](https://github.com/CreativeIT/getmdl-select). Also project uses [d3](https://d3js.org/) and [nvd3](http://nvd3.org/) to build charts and chart components.\n\n\n# Hire us\nWe are ready to bring value to your business.
