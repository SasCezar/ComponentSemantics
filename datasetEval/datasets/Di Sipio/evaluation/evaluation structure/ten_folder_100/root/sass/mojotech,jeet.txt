Be sure to read [the migration guide](https://github.com/mojotech/jeet/wiki/Migrating-from-6-to-7)!\n\n[Jeet](http://jeet.gs) is a simple fractional grid system for **[Sass](scss)** and **[Stylus](styl)**.\n\nLearn the [API](docs) in minutes and begin tossing together grids.\n\nCheck this out:\n\n```fish\nnpm install -D jeet\n```\n\n```scss\n@import \'node_modules/jeet/jeet\';\n\n.container {\n  @include center();\n}\n\n.container div {\n  @include column(1/3);\n}\n```\n\nJeet functions accept fractions (or float numbers) and generates a percentage width and gutter for grids. We\'re able to do this while maintaining a consistently-sized, infinitely-nestable, gutter (so long as you provide the parent element\'s fraction as context).\n\nThe API is documented in Sass, but we\'ve worked hard to make the API *very* similar in both preprocessors. `@include column(1/2);` in SCSS would be `column(1/2)` in Stylus, ya dig?\n\nExplore [Official Integrations](docs/integrations) to see some community-backed plugins to your favorite frameworks and libraries.\n\n#### Browser Support\n\n- IE9+ without help. IE8+ with Selectivizr. Obviously always use Autoprefixer.\n'
