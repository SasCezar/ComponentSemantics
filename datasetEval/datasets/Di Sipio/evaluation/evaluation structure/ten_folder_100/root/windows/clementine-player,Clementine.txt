Instead, you can subscribe to the issue to be notified of anything new about it\n\n### Report a bug\n\nPlease:\n \n * Try the latest developer build (http://builds.clementine-player.org/) to see if any bug is still present (**Attention**, those builds aren\'t stable so they might not work well and could sometimes break things like user settings). If it works fine even though you see an open issue, please comment on it and explain that the issue has been fixed\n * Check if another person has already opened the same issue to avoid duplicates\n * If there already is an open issue you could comment on it to add precisions about the problem or confirm it\n * In case there isn\'t, you can open a new issue with an explicit title and as much information as possible (OS, Clementine version, how to reproduce the problem...)\n * Please use http://pastebin.com/ for logs/debug\n \nIf there are no answers, it doesn\'t mean we don\'t care about your feature request/bug. It just means we can\'t reproduce the bug or haven\'t had time to implement it :o)\n\nCompiling from source\n---------------------\n\nGet the code (if you haven\'t already):\n\n    git clone https://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine.git && cd Clementine\n\nCompile and install:\n\n    cd bin\n    cmake ..\n    make -j8\n    sudo make install\n\nSee the Wiki for more instructions and a list of dependencies:\nhttps://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine/wiki/Compiling-from-Source\n'
