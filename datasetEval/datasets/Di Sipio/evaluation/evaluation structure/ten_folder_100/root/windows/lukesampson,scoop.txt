It tries to eliminate things like:\n\n- Permission popup windows\n- GUI wizard-style installers\n- Path pollution from installing lots of programs\n- Unexpected side-effects from installing and uninstalling programs\n- The need to find and install dependencies\n- The need to perform extra setup steps to get a working program\n\nScoop is very scriptable, so you can run repeatable setups to get your environment just the way you like, e.g.:\n\n```powershell\nscoop install sudo\nsudo scoop install 7zip git openssh --global\nscoop install aria2 curl grep sed less touch\nscoop install python ruby go perl\n```\n\nIf you\'ve built software that you\'d like others to use, Scoop is an alternative to building an installer (e.g. MSI or InnoSetup) \xe2\x80\x94 you just need to zip your program and provide a JSON manifest that describes how to install it.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Windows 7 SP1+ / Windows Server 2008+\n- [PowerShell 5](https://aka.ms/wmf5download) (or later, include [PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-6)) and [.NET Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) (or later)\n- PowerShell must be enabled for your user account e.g. `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`\n\n## Installation\n\nRun the following command from your PowerShell to install scoop to its default location (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\scoop`)\n\n```powershell\nInvoke-Expression (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\'https://get.scoop.sh\')\n\n# or shorter\niwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex\n```\n\nOnce installed, run `scoop help` for instructions.\n\nThe default setup is configured so all user installed programs and Scoop itself live in `C:\\Users\\<user>\\scoop`.\nGlobally installed programs (`--global`) live in `C:\\ProgramData\\scoop`.\nThese settings can be changed through environment variables.\n\n### Install Scoop to a Custom Directory by changing `SCOOP`\n\n```powershell\n$env:SCOOP=\'D:\\Applications\\Scoop\'\n[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\'SCOOP\', $env:SCOOP, \'User\')\n# run the installer\n```\n\n### Configure Scoop to install global programs to a Custom Directory by changing `SCOOP_GLOBAL`\n\n```powershell\n$env:SCOOP_GLOBAL=\'F:\\GlobalScoopApps\'\n[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\'SCOOP_GLOBAL\', $env:SCOOP_GLOBAL, \'Machine\')\n# run the installer\n```\n\n## [Documentation](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki)\n\n## Multi-connection downloads with `aria2`\n\nScoop can utilize [`aria2`](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) to use multi-connection downloads. Simply install `aria2` through Scoop and it will be used for all downloads afterward.\n\n```powershell\nscoop install aria2\n```\n\nYou can tweak the following `aria2` settings with the `scoop config` command:\n\n- aria2-enabled (default: true)\n- [aria2-retry-wait](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-retry-wait) (default: 2)\n- [aria2-split](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-s) (default: 5)\n- [aria2-max-connection-per-server](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-x) (default: 5)\n- [aria2-min-split-size](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-k) (default: 5M)\n\n## Inspiration\n\n- [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/)\n- [sub](https://github.com/37signals/sub#readme)\n\n## What sort of apps can Scoop install?\n\nThe apps that install best with Scoop are commonly called "portable" apps: i.e. compressed program files that run stand-alone when extracted and don\'t have side-effects like changing the registry or putting files outside the program directory.\n\nSince installers are common, Scoop supports them too (and their uninstallers).\n\nScoop is also great at handling single-file programs and Powershell scripts. These don\'t even need to be compressed. See the [runat](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main/blob/master/bucket/runat.json) package for an example: it\'s really just a GitHub gist.\n\n### Support this project\n\nIf you find Scoop useful and would like to support ongoing development and maintenance, here\'s how:\n\n- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DM2SUH9EUXSKJ) (one-time donation)\n\n## Known application buckets\n\nThe following buckets are known to scoop:\n\n- [main](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main) - Default bucket for the most common (mostly CLI) apps\n- [extras](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras) - Apps that don\'t fit the main bucket\'s [criteria](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki/Criteria-for-including-apps-in-the-main-bucket)\n- [games](https://github.com/Calinou/scoop-games) - Open source/freeware games and game-related tools\n- [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/matthewjberger/scoop-nerd-fonts) -  Nerd Fonts\n- [nirsoft](https://github.com/kodybrown/scoop-nirsoft) - A subset of the [250](https://github.com/rasa/scoop-directory/blob/master/by-score.md#MCOfficer_scoop-nirsoft) [Nirsoft](https://nirsoft.net) apps\n- [java](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Java) - Installers for Oracle Java, OpenJDK, Zulu, ojdkbuild, AdoptOpenJDK, Amazon Corretto, BellSoft Liberica & SapMachine\n- [jetbrains](https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-JetBrains) - Installers for all JetBrains utilities and IDEs\n<!-- * [nightlies](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Nightlies) - No longer used -->\n- [nonportable](https://github.com/oltolm/scoop-nonportable) - Non-portable apps (may require UAC)\n- [php](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/PHP) - Installers for most versions of PHP\n- [versions](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Versions) - Alternative versions of apps found in other buckets\n\nThe main bucket is installed by default. To add any of the other buckets, type:\n```\nscoop bucket add bucketname\n```\nFor example, to add the extras bucket, type:\n```\nscoop bucket add extras\n```\n\n## Other application buckets\n\nMany other application buckets hosted on Github can be found in the [Scoop Directory](https://github.com/rasa/scoop-directory).\n'
