b"# Tagbar: a class outline viewer for Vim\n\n[![Vint](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar/workflows/Vint/badge.svg)](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar/actions?workflow=Vint)\n[![Check](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar/workflows/Check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar/actions?workflow=Check)\n\n## What Tagbar is\n\nTagbar is a Vim plugin that provides an easy way to browse the tags of the\ncurrent file and get an overview of its structure. It does this by creating a\nsidebar that displays the ctags-generated tags of the current file, ordered by\ntheir scope. This means that for example methods in C++ are displayed under\nthe class they are defined in.\n\n## What Tagbar is not\n\nTagbar is not a general-purpose tool for managing `tags` files. It only\ncreates the tags it needs on-the-fly in-memory without creating any files.\n`tags` file management is provided by other plugins, like for example\n[easytags](https://github.com/xolox/vim-easytags).\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) >= 7.3.1058\n  or any version of [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/).\n\n* [Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) >= 5.5,\n  or (**highly recommended**) any version of [Universal\n  Ctags](https://ctags.io) which is a currently maintained fork of Exuberant\n  Ctags with many bugfixes, support for many more formats, and proper Unicode\n  support. Some additional formats can also be handled by other providers such\n  as [jsctags](https://github.com/sergioramos/jsctags),\n  [phpctags](https://github.com/vim-php/phpctags), or others.\n\n## Installation\n\nExtract the archive or clone the repository into a directory in your\n`'runtimepath'`, or use a plugin manager of your choice like\n[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). Don't forget to run\n`:helptags` if your plugin manager doesn't do it for you so you can access the\ndocumentation with `:help tagbar`.\n\nIf the ctags executable is not installed in one of the directories in your\n`$PATH` environment variable you have to set the `g:tagbar_ctags_bin`\nvariable, see the documentation for more info.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nPut something like the following into your ~/.vimrc:\n\n```vim\nnmap <F8> :TagbarToggle<CR>\n```\n\nIf you do this the F8 key will toggle the Tagbar window. You can of course use\nany shortcut you want. For more flexible ways to open and close the window\n(and the rest of the functionality) see the documentation.\n\n## Support for additional filetypes\n\nFor filetypes that are not supported by Exuberant Ctags check out [the\nwiki](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar/wiki) to see whether other projects\noffer support for them and how to use them. Please add any other\nprojects/configurations that you find or create yourself so that others can\nbenefit from them, too.\n\n## Note: If the file structure display is wrong\n\nIf you notice that there are some errors in the way your file's structure is\ndisplayed in Tagbar, please make sure that the bug is actually in Tagbar\nbefore you report an issue. Since Tagbar uses\n[exuberant-ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) and compatible programs to do\nthe actual file parsing, it is likely that the bug is actually in the program\nresponsible for that filetype instead.\n\nThere is an example in `:h tagbar-issues` about how to run ctags manually so\nyou can determine where the bug actually is. If the bug is actually in ctags,\nplease report it on their website instead, as there is nothing I can do about\nit in Tagbar. Thank you!\n\nYou can also have a look at [ctags bugs that have previously been filed\nagainst Tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar/issues?labels=ctags-bug&page=1&state=closed).\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![screenshot1](https://i.imgur.com/Sf9Ls2r.png)\n![screenshot2](https://i.imgur.com/n4bpPv3.png)\n\n## License\n\nVim license, see LICENSE\n\n## Maintainer\n\nJan Larres <[jan@majutsushi.net](mailto:jan@majutsushi.net)>\n"
