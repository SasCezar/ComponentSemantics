[Update Git for Windows](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases) to the latest (or at least v2.16.0).\n\nThe most common error users see looks like:\n\n```text\nfatal: HttpRequestException encountered.\n   An error occurred while sending the request.\nfatal: HttpRequestException encountered.\n   An error occurred while sending the request.\nUsername for 'https://github.com':\n```\n\nIf, after updating Git for Windows, you are still having problems authenticating with GitHub, please read this [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/201457/unable-to-connect-to-github-due-to-tls-12-only-cha.html) topic which contains additional remedial actions you can take to resolve the problem.\n\nIf you are experiencing issue when using **Visual Studio**, please read **[Unable to connect to GitHub with Visual Studio](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/201457/unable-to-connect-to-github-due-to-tls-12-only-cha.html)**.\n\n* * *\n\nThe [Git Credential Manager for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows) (GCM) provides secure Git credential storage for Windows. It's the successor to the [Windows Credential Store for Git](https://gitcredentialstore.codeplex.com/) (git-credential-winstore), which is no longer maintained. Compared to Git's built-in credential storage for Windows ([wincred](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage)), which provides single-factor authentication support working on any HTTP enabled Git repository, GCM provides multi-factor authentication support for [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/), [Team Foundation Server](Docs/Faq.md#q-i-thought-microsoft-was-maintaining-this-why-does-the-gcm-not-work-as-expected-with-tfs), GitHub, and Bitbucket.\n\nThis project includes:\n\n* Secure password storage in the Windows Credential Store.\n* Multi-factor authentication support for Azure DevOps.\n* Two-factor authentication support for GitHub.\n* Two-factor authentication support for Bitbucket.\n* Personal Access Token generation and usage support for Azure DevOps, GitHub, and Bitbucket.\n* Non-interactive mode support for Azure DevOps backed by Azure Directory.\n* NTLM/Kerberos authentication for Team Foundation Server ([see notes](Docs/Faq.md#q-i-thought-microsoft-was-maintaining-this-why-does-the-gcm-not-work-as-expected-with-tfs)).\n* Optional settings for [build agent optimization](Docs/Automation.md).\n\n## Community\n\nThis is a community project so feel free to contribute ideas, submit bugs, fix bugs, or code new features. For detailed information on how the GCM works go to the [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/wiki/How-the-Git-Credential-Managers-works).\n\n## Download and Install\n\nTo use the GCM, you can download the [latest installer](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases/latest). To install, double-click `GCMW-{version}.exe` and follow the instructions presented.\n\nWhen prompted to select your terminal emulator for Git Bash you should choose the Windows' default console window, or make sure GCM is [configured to use modal dialogs](Docs/Configuration.md#modalprompt). GCM cannot prompt you for credentials, at the console, in a MinTTY setup.\n\n### Manual Installation\n\nNote for users with special installation needs, you can still extract the `gcm-{version}.zip` file and run install.cmd from an administrator command prompt. This allows specification of the installation options explained below.\n\n### Installation in an MSYS2 Environment\n\nTo use the GCM along with git installed with `pacman` in an MSYS2 environment, simply [download a release zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases) and extract the contents directly into `C:\\msys64\\usr\\lib\\git-core` (assuming your MSYS2 environment is installed in `C:\\msys64`). Then run:\n\n```shell\ngit config --global credential.helper manager\n```\n\n## How to use\n\nYou don't. It [magically](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/issues/31) works when credentials are needed. For example, when pushing to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com), it automatically opens a window and initializes an oauth2 flow to get your token.\n\n### Build and Install from Sources\n\nTo build and install the GCM yourself, clone the sources, open the solution file in Visual Studio, and build the solution. All necessary components will be copied from the build output locations into a `.\\Deploy` folder at the root of the solution. From an elevated command prompt in the `.\\Deploy` folder issue the following command `git-credential-manager install`. Additional information about [development and debugging](Docs/Development.md) are available in our documents area.\n\n[Various options](Docs/Configuration.md) are available for uniquely configured systems, like automated build systems. For systems with a **non-standard placement of Git** use the `--path <git>` parameter to supply where Git is located and thus where the GCM should be deployed to. For systems looking to **avoid checking for the Microsoft .NET Framework** and other similar prerequisites use the `--force` option. For systems looking for **silent installation without any prompts**, use the `--passive` option.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n* [Credential Manager Usage](Docs/CredentialManager.md)\n* [Askpass Usage](Docs/Askpass.md)\n* [Configuration Options](Docs/Configuration.md)\n* [Build Agent and Automation Support](Docs/Automation.md)\n* [Bitbucket Specific Details](Docs/Bitbucket.md)\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](Docs/Faq.md)\n* [Development and Debugging](Docs/Development.md)\n\n## Contribute\n\nThere are many ways to contribute.\n\n* [Submit bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/issues) and help us verify fixes as they are checked in.\n* Review [code changes](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/pulls).\n* Contribute bug fixes and features.\n\n### Code Contributions\n\nFor code contributions, you will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
