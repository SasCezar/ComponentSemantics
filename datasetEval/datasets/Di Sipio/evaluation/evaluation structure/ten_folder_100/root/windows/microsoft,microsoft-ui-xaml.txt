b'# Windows UI Library\n\n[![Follow WinUI on Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/windowsui.svg?label=Follow%20WinUI%20on%20Twitter&style=social)](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=windowsui)\n\nThe Windows UI Library (WinUI) provides official native Microsoft UI controls and features for Windows [UWP apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/index).\n\nWinUI is the easiest way to build great [Fluent Design](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/fluent-design-system/) experiences for Windows.\n\nWinUI can be used in any Windows 10 UWP XAML app, or in a Xamarin.Forms app running on Windows 10 using [native view embedding](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/platform/native-views).\n\n## WinUI 3.0 Alpha (November 2019)\n\nAs outlined in the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) we\'re currently working on WinUI 3.0, which will greatly expand the scope of WinUI to include the full native Windows UI platform.\n\nYou can now [download an early build of WinUI 3.0 Alpha](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui3/) to try out - we\'d love your feedback!\n\nFor more info see the [discussion issue #1531](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/1531).\n\n## Using WinUI\nYou can download and use WinUI packages in your app using the NuGet package manager: see the [Getting Started with the Windows UI Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui/getting-started) page for more information.\n\n### Packages\n\n| NuGet Package | Build Status | Latest Versions | Documentation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Microsoft.UI.Xaml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml) <br /> Controls and Fluent Design for UWP apps | [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ms/microsoft-ui-xaml/_apis/build/status/WinUI-Public-MUX-CI?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/ms/microsoft-ui-xaml/_build/latest?definitionId=20?branchName=master) | [![latest stable version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Microsoft.UI.Xaml.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml) <br /> [![latest prerelease version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Microsoft.UI.Xaml.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml/absoluteLatest) | [2.2 release](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui/release-notes/winui-2.2) |\n| [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct) <br /> Low-level APIs for middleware components | | [![latest prerelease version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct/absoluteLatest) | [2.0 prerelease](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.core.direct) |\n\nYou can also build a WinUI package yourself from source. See [Contributing to the Windows UI Library](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on building and contributing to WinUI.\n\n## Documentation\n\n**WinUI usage documentation**:  \nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui\n\n**Release notes**:  \nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui/release-notes/\n\n**Sample code**:  \nTo view the WinUI controls in an interactive format, check out the Xaml Controls Gallery:\n* Get the XAML Controls Gallery app from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MSVH128X2ZT)\n* Get the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery)\n\n## Contributing to WinUI\nThe WinUI team welcomes feedback and contributions!\n\nFor information on how to contribute please see [Contributing to the Windows UI Library](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## WinUI features\n\n### Benefits\n\nThe WinUI Library provides some useful benefits when building apps for Windows 10:\n\n1. **Helps you stay up to date**  \nWinUI helps keep your app up to date with the latest versions of key controls and features of [UWP XAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/xaml-overview) and the [Fluent Design System](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent)\n\n2. **Provides backward compatibility**  \nWinUI is backward-compatible with a wide range of Windows 10 versions: you can start building and shipping apps with new XAML features immediately as soon as they\'re released, even if your users aren\'t on the latest version of Windows 10\n\n3. **Makes it simpler to build version adaptive apps**  \nYou don\'t need version checks or conditional XAML markup to use WinUI controls or features: WinUI automatically adapts to the user\'s OS version\n\n### Version support\n\nThe Microsoft.UI.Xaml 2.2 NuGet package requires your project to have TargetPlatformVersion &gt;= 10.0.18362.0 and TargetPlatformMinVersion &gt;= 10.0.15063.0 when building. \n\nYour app\'s users can be on any of the following supported Windows 10 versions:\n\n* Windows Insider Previews\n* May 2019 Update (18362 aka "19H1")\n* October 2018 Update (17763 aka "Redstone 5")\n* April 2018 Update (17134 aka "Redstone 4")\n* Fall Creators Update (16299 aka "Redstone 3")\n* Creators Update (15063 aka "Redstone 2")\n\nSome features may have a reduced or slightly different user experience on older versions, particularly on builds before 15063. This should not impact overall usability.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nFor info on the WinUI release schedule and high level plans please see the [Windows UI Library Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).\n\n## Data/Telemetry\n\nThis project collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services.
