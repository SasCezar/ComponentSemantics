Discover which processes are using that file.\r\n* See what programs have active network connections, and close them if necessary.\r\n* Get real-time information on disk access.\r\n* View detailed stack traces with kernel-mode, WOW64 and .NET support.\r\n* Go beyond services.msc: create, edit and control services.\r\n* Small, portable and no installation required.\r\n* 100% [Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) ([GPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html))\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building the project\r\n\r\n\r\nRequires Visual Studio (2017 or later).\r\n\r\nExecute `build_release.cmd` located in the `build` directory to compile the project or load the `ProcessHacker.sln` and `Plugins.sln` solutions if you prefer building the project using Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nYou can download the free [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)\r\nto build, run or develop Process Hacker.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\n\r\nYou cannot run the 32-bit version of Process Hacker on a\r\n64-bit system and expect it to work correctly, unlike other programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Enhancements/Bugs\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/processhacker2/processhacker/issues)\r\nfor reporting problems or suggesting new features.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n\r\nIf you are running Process Hacker from a USB drive, you may want to\r\nsave Process Hacker\'s settings there as well. To do this, create a\r\nblank file named "ProcessHacker.exe.settings.xml" in the same\r\ndirectory as ProcessHacker.exe. You can do this using Windows Explorer:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure "Hide extensions for known file types" is unticked in\r\n   Tools > Folder options > View.\r\n2. Right-click in the folder and choose New > Text Document.\r\n3. Rename the file to ProcessHacker.exe.settings.xml (delete the ".txt"\r\n   extension).\r\n\r\n## Plugins\r\n\r\nPlugins can be configured from Hacker > Plugins.\r\n\r\nIf you experience any crashes involving plugins, make sure they\r\nare up to date.\r\n\r\nDisk and Network information provided by the ExtendedTools plugin is\r\nonly available when running Process Hacker with administrative\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n## KProcessHacker\r\n\r\nProcess Hacker uses a kernel-mode driver, KProcessHacker, to\r\nassist with certain functionality. This includes:\r\n\r\n* Capturing kernel-mode stack traces\r\n* More efficiently enumerating process handles\r\n* Retrieving names for file handles\r\n* Retrieving names for EtwRegistration objects\r\n* Setting handle attributes\r\n\r\nNote that by default, KProcessHacker only allows connections from\r\nprocesses with administrative privileges (SeDebugPrivilege). To allow Process Hacker \r\nto show details for all processes when it is not running as administrator:\r\n\r\n1. In Registry Editor, navigate to:\r\n   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\KProcessHacker3\r\n2. Under this key, create a key named Parameters if it does not exist.\r\n3. Create a DWORD value named SecurityLevel and set it to 2. If you are\r\n   not using an official build, you may need to set it to 0 instead.\r\n4. Restart the KProcessHacker3 service (sc stop KProcessHacker3,\r\n   sc start KProcessHacker3).\r\n'
