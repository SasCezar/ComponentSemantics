See `./doc/uncrustify.cfg` for the parameters used to reformat the code.\n* Mappings of bzr revisions to git commits (for historical purposes) are available in `./doc/git-bzr-rev-map`\n* See also `./doc/README` and `./doc/HACKING`\n\n## Help?\n\nJoin **#BitlBee** on OFTC (**irc.oftc.net**) (OFTC, *not* freenode!)\n"
