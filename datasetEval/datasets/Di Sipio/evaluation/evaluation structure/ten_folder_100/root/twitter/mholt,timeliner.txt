It collects all your digital things from pretty much anywhere and stores them on your own computer, indexes them, and projects them onto a single, unified timeline.\n\nThe intended purpose of this tool is to help preserve personal and family history.\n\nThings that are stored by Timeliner are easily accessible in a SQLite database or, for media items like photos and videos, are simply plopped onto your disk as regular files, organized in folders by date and data source.\n\n**WIP Notice:** This project works as documented for the most part, but is still very young. Please consider this experimental until stable releases. The documentation needs a lot of work too, I know, so feel free to contribute.\n\n\n## About\n\nIn general, Timeliner obtains _items_ from _data sources_ and stores them in a _timeline_.\n\n- **Items** are anything that has content: text, image, video, etc. For example: photos, tweets, social media posts, even locations.\n- **Data sources** are anything that can provide a list of items. For example: social media sites, online services, archive files, etc.\n- **Timelines** are repositories that store the data. Typically, you will have one timeline that is your own, but timelines can support multiple people and multiple accounts per person if you desire to share it.\n\nTechnically speaking:\n\n- An **Item** implements [this interface](https://godoc.org/github.com/mholt/timeliner#Item) and provides access to its content and metadata.\n- A **DataSource** is defined by [this struct](https://godoc.org/github.com/mholt/timeliner#DataSource) and configures a Client to access it. Clients are the types that do the actual work of listing of items.\n- A **Timeline** is opened when being used. It consists of an underlying SQLite database and an adjacent data folder where larger/media items are stored as files. Timelines are essentially the folder that contains them. They are portable, so you can move them around and won\'t break things. However, don\'t change the contents of the folder directly! Don\'t add, remove, or modify items in the folder; you will break something. This does not mean timelines are read-only: they just have to be modified through the program in order to stay consistent.\n\nTimeliner can pull data in from local or remote sources. It provides integrated support for OAuth2 and rate limiting where that is needed. It can also import data from local files. For example, some online services let you download all your data as an archive file. Timeliner can read those and index your data.\n\nTimeliner data sources are strictly _read-only_ meaning that no write permissions are needed and Timeliner will never change or delete the source.\n\n## Features\n\n- Supported data sources\n\t- [Facebook](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner/wiki/Data-Source:-Facebook)\n\t- [Google Location History](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner/wiki/Data-Source:-Google-Location-History)\n\t- [Google Photos](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner/wiki/Data-Source:-Google-Photos)\n\t- [Twitter](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner/wiki/Data-Source:-Twitter)\n\t- [Instagram](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner/wiki/Data-Source:-Instagram)\n\t- [SMS Backup & Restore](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner/wiki/Data-Source:-SMS-Backup-&-Restore)\n\t- **[Learn how to add more](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner/wiki/Writing-a-Data-Source)** - we\'d love your contribution!\n- Checkpointing (resume interrupted downloads)\n- Pruning\n- Integrity checks\n- Deduplication\n- Differential reprocessing (only re-process items that have changed on the source)\n- Construct graph-like relationships between items and people\n- Memory-efficient for high-volume data processing\n- Built-in rate limiting for API clients\n- Built-in OAuth2 facilities for API clients\n- Ability to get and organize data from... almost anything, really, including export files\n\nSome features are dependent upon the actual implementation of each data source. For example, differential reprocessing requires that the data source provide some sort of checksum or "ETag" for the item, but if that is not available, there\'s no way to know if an item has changed remotely without downloading the whole thing and reprocessing it.\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ go get -u github.com/mholt/timeliner/cmd/timeliner\n```\n\n## Tutorial\n\n_After you\'ve read this tutorial, [the Timeliner wiki](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner/wiki/) has all the information you\'ll need for using each data source._\n\nThese are the basic steps for getting set up:\n\n1. Create a `timeliner.toml` config file (if any data sources require authentication)\n2. Add your data source accounts to your timeline\n3. Begin filling your timeline!\n\nAll items are associated with an account from whence they come. Even if a data source doesn\'t have the concept of accounts, Timeliner still has to think there is one.\n\nAccounts are designated in the form `<data source ID>/<user ID>`, for example: `twitter/mholt6`. The data source ID is shown on each data source\'s [wiki page](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner/wiki/). With some data sources (like the Twitter API), the user ID matters, so where possible, give the actual username or email address you use with that service. For data sources that don\'t have the concept of accounts or a login, choose a user ID you will recognize such that the data source ID + user ID are unique.\n\nIf we want to use accounts that require OAuth2, we need to configure Timeliner with OAuth2 app credentials. You can learn which data sources need OAuth2 and what their configuration looks like by reading their [wiki page](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner/wiki/). By default, Timeliner will try to load `timeliner.toml` from the current directory, but you can use the `-config` flag to change that. Here\'s a sample `timeliner.toml` file for authenticating with Google:\n\n```\n[oauth2.providers.google]\nclient_id = "YOUR_APP_ID"\nclient_secret = "YOUR_APP_SECRET"\nauth_url = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"\ntoken_url = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token"\n```\n\nWith that, let\'s create an account to store our Google Photos:\n\n```\n$ timeliner add-account google_photos/you@gmail.com\n```\n\nThis will open your browser window to authenticate with OAuth2.\n\nYou will notice that a folder called `timeliner_repo` was created in the current directory. This is your timeline. You can move it around if you want, and then use the `-repo` flag to work with that timeline.\n\nNow let\'s get all our stuff from Google Photos. And I mean, _all_ of it. It\'s ours, after all, not Google\'s:\n\n```\n$ timeliner get-all google_photos/you@gmail.com\n```\n\n(You can list any number of accounts on a single command; except for `import` commands.)\n\nThis process can take weeks if you have a large library. Even if you have a fast Internet connection, the client is carefully rate-limited to be a good API citizen, so the process will be slow.\n\nIf you open your timeline folder in a file browser, you will see it start to fill up with your photos from Google Photos.\n\nData sources may create checkpoints as they go. If so, `get-all` or `get-latest` will automatically resume the last listing if it was interrupted. In the case of Google Photos, each page of API results is checkpointed. Checkpoints are not intended for long-term pauses. In other words, a resume should happen fairly shortly after being interrupted.\n\nItem processing is idempotent, so as long as items have faithfully-unique IDs across each account, items that already exist in the timeline will be skipped and/or processed much faster.\n\n\n\n### Pulling the latest\n\nOnce your initial download completes, you can run Timeliner so that only the latest items are retrieved:\n\n```\n$ timeliner get-latest google_photos/you@gmail.com\n```\n\nThis will get only the items timestamped newer than the newest item in your timeline (from the last successful run).\n\nIf `get-latest` is interrupted after adding some newer items to the timeline, the next run of `get-latest` will not stop at the first new item added last time; it is smart enough to know that it was interrupted and needs to keep getting items all the way until the beginning of the last _successful_ run.\n\n\n### Reprocessing items\n\nBy default, Timeliner will not re-process items that are already in your timeline. However, Timeliner will reprocess items already in your timeline if:\n\n- You run with the `-integrity` flag which enables integrity checks, and an item\'s data file fails the integrity check. In that case, the item will be reprocessed to restore its correct data.\n\n- The item has changed on the data source _and the data source indicates this change somehow_. However, very few (if any?) data sources actually provide a hash or ETag to help us compare whether a resource has changed. (HTTP sure has it nice, huh...)\n\nSince it is often impossible to know without actually downloading the whole item whether it has changed, you can run Timeliner with the `-reprocess` flag to do a "full reprocess" which indiscriminately reprocesses every item, just in case it changed. In other words, a reprocess will update your local copy with the source\'s latest.\n\nTODO: Maybe we should change the flag name to `-update`?\n\n\n### Pruning your timeline\n\nSuppose you downloaded a bunch of photos with Timeliner that you later deleted from Google Photos. Timeliner can remove those items from your local timeline, too, to save disk space and keep things clean.\n\nHowever, this involves doing a complete listing of all the items. Pruning happens at the end. Any items not seen in the listing will be deleted. This also means that a full, uninterrupted listing is required, since resuming from a checkpoint yields an incomplete file listing. Pruning after a resumed listing will result in an error. (There\'s a TODO to improve this situation -- feel free to contribute! We just need to preserve the item listing along with the checkpoint.)\n\nTo schedule a prune, just run with the `-prune` flag: `timeliner -prune get-all ...`.\n\n\n### Reauthenticating with a data source\n\nSome data sources (Facebook) expire tokens that don\'t have recent user interactions. Every 2-3 months, you may need to reauthenticate:\n\n```\n$ timeliner reauth facebook/you\n```\n\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner/wiki) for each data source to know if you need to reauthenticate and how to do so. Sometimes you have to go to the data source itself and authorize a reauthentication first.\n\n\n### More information about each data source\n\nCongratulations, you\'ve [graduated to the wiki pages](https://github.com/mholt/timeliner/wiki) to learn more about how to set up and use each data source.\n\n\n\n## Motivation and long-term vision\n\nThe motivation for this project is two-fold. Both press upon me with a sense of urgency, which is why I dedicated some nights and weekends to work on this.\n\n1) Connecting with my family -- both living and deceased -- is important to me and my close relatives. But I wish we had more insights into the lives and values of those who came before us. What better time than right now to start collecting personal histories from all available sources and develop a rich timeline of our life for our family, and maybe even for our own reference or nostalgia.\n\n2) Our lives are better-documented than any before us, but the documentation is more ephemeral than any before us, too. We lose control of our data by relying on centralized, proprietary cloud services which are useful today, and gone tomorrow. I wrote Timeliner because now is the time to liberate my data from corporations who don\'t own it, yet who have the only copy of it. This reality has made me feel uneasy for years, and it\'s not going away soon. Timeliner makes it bearable.\n\nImagine being able to pull up a single screen with your data from any and all of your online accounts and services -- while offline. And there you see so many aspects of your life at a glance: your photos and videos, social media posts, locations on a map and how you got there, emails and letters, documents, health and physical activities, and even your GitHub projects (if you\'re like me), for any given day. You can "zoom out" and get the big picture. Machine learning algorithms could suggest major clusters based on your content to summarize your days, months, or years, and from that, even recommend printing physical memorabilia. It\'s like a highly-detailed, automated journal, fully in your control, which you can add to in the app: augment it with your own thoughts like a regular journal.\n\nThen cross-reference your own timeline with a global public timeline: see how locations you went to changed over time, or what major news events may have affected you, or what the political/social climate was like at the time.\n\nOr translate the projection sideways, and instead of looking at time cross-sections, look at cross-sections of your timeline by media type: photos, posts, location, sentiment. Look at plots, charts, graphs, of your physical activity.\n\nAnd all of this runs on your own computer: no one else has access to it, no one else owns it, but you.\n\n\n## Viewing your Timeline\n\nThere is not yet a viewer for the timeline. For now, I\'ve just been using [Table Plus](https://tableplus.io) to browse the SQLite database, and my file browser to look at the files in it. The important thing is that you have them, at least.\n\nHowever, a viewer would be really cool. It\'s something I\'ve been wanting to do but don\'t have time for right now. Contributions are welcomed along these lines, but this feature _must_ be thoroughly discussed before any pull requests will be accepted to implement a timeline viewer. Thanks!\n\n\n## Notes\n\nYeah, I know this is very similar to what [Perkeep](https://perkeep.org/) does. Perkeep is a way cooler project in my opinion. However, Perkeep is more about storage and sync, whereas Timeliner is more focused on constructing relationships between items and projecting your digital life onto a single timeline. If Perkeep is my unified personal data storage, then Timeliner is my automatic journal. (Believe me, my heart sank after I realized that I was almost rewriting parts of Perkeep, until I decided that the two are different enough to warrant a separate project.)\n\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed with AGPL. I chose this license because I do not want others to make proprietary software using this package. The point of this project is liberation of and control over one\'s own, personal data, and I want to ensure that this project won\'t be used in anything that would perpetuate the walled garden dilemma we already face today.\n\n'
