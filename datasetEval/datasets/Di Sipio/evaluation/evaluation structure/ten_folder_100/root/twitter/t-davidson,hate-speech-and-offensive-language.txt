We have included them as a pickle file (Python 2.7) and as a CSV. You will also find a notebook in the `src` directory containing Python 2.7 code to replicate our analyses in the paper and a lexicon in the `lexicons` directory that we generated to try to more accurately classify hate speech. The `classifier` directory contains a script, instructions, and the necessary files to run our classifier on new data, a test case is provided.\n\n\n***Please cite our paper in any published work that uses any of these resources.***\n~~~\n@inproceedings{hateoffensive,\n  title = {Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language},\n  author = {Davidson, Thomas and Warmsley, Dana and Macy, Michael and Weber, Ingmar}, \n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 11th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media},\n  series = {ICWSM \'17},\n  year = {2017},\n  location = {Montreal, Canada},\n  pages = {512-515}\n  }\n~~~\n\n***Contact***\nWe would also appreciate it if you could fill out this short [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrPNlfVBlqxun2tivzAtsZaOoPC5YYMocn-xscCgeRakLXHg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1506871634&entry.147453066&entry.1390333885&entry.516829772) if you are interested in using our data so we can keep track of how these data are used and get in contact with researchers working on similar problems.\n\nIf you have any questions please contact `trd54 at cornell dot edu`.\n'
