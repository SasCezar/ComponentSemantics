The core technology used consists of [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) + [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components). All transpiled from ES6 Javascript.\n\n## Downloads\n\n#### \xf0\x9f\x8d\x8e [MacOS](https://github.com/jonathontoon/tweet-tray/releases/download/v1.1.5/tweet-tray-1.1.5.dmg) \n#### \xf0\x9f\x8f\xa8 [Windows](https://github.com/jonathontoon/tweet-tray/releases/download/v1.1.5/tweet-tray-1.1.5.exe)\n#### \xf0\x9f\x90\xa7 [Linux (AppImage)](https://github.com/jonathontoon/tweet-tray/releases/download/v1.1.5/tweet-tray-1.1.5.AppImage) \n#### \xf0\x9f\x90\xa7 [Linux (DEB File)](https://github.com/jonathontoon/tweet-tray/releases/download/v1.1.5/tweet-tray-1.1.5.deb)\n\nSee [releases](https://github.com/jonathontoon/tweet-tray/releases) for more information.\n\n## Install with Homebrew\n\nYou can also install Tweet Tray with [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/), `brew cask install tweet-tray`.\n\n## Settings\nSome application settings can be passed via commandline arguments. For a full list, run the executable from the commandline with the  `--help` argument. \n- `--proxy` You can configure Tweet Tray to use a HTTP [proxy server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server), by setting the `--proxy` argument.  This takes a string value of the proxy server address and port, in the form of `--proxy address:port`.  This also supports [SOCKS5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) by using the `socks5` protocol prefix, eg `--proxy socks5://address:port`. \n\n## Report Bugs\nPlease create a Github [issue](https://github.com/jonathontoon/tweet-tray/issues) and provide as much information as possible regarding the bug, including images or error codes. To make things as uniform as possible please follow the guidelines set out in `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`.\n\n## Development\n\n1. Fork the Tweet Tray repository on Github to your own account then clone it locally.\n\n2. To run Tweet Tray locally you will need to first install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package managers.\n\n3. Setup the applications\' dependencies by navigating to the `tweet-tray` directory and run `yarn install`.\n\n4. Before you can use all functions of Tweet Tray you\'ll need to create your own [Twitter OAuth Application](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new) to test. You don\'t need to set a callback URL, as Tweet Tray uses a mannually input Authorization code. After that, take the Consumer Key and Secret and update your local `config.js` file found under `app/utils`.\n\n5. After everything has been installed simply call `yarn dev` to run the development build. To run the production build you can call `yarn prestart` followed by `yarn start`.\n\nFor all new features or bug fixes please create an issue in the main repository first (so we can track what goes into each release) then simply submit a pull request from your own fork into the original `develop` branch. To make sure the changes are easily reviewable please repect the format set out in `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.\n\n## Deployment\n\nTo create an installable build simply call `yarn package`, which will create an executable based on your current operating system. If you want to debug something in a packaged build you can call `DEBUG_PROD=true yarn package`.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project is based off [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate), all methodologies still apply, except for the removal of Flow and SASS. Issue and pull request templates based on formats by [yoshuawyts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yoshuawuyts/templates/master/github/).\n'
