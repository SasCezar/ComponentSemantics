A lot of the syntax remains the same,\nbut there are quite a few breaking changes that were necessary in order to get the framework\nto where we wanted it to be. It is now truly a micro-framework. With only 2 dependencies and without\nrelying on express anymore, Botmaster v3 is the only JS bot framework that gives as much control\nas possible to the developer without losing its ease of use.\n\nA migration documentation can be found at: http://botmasterai.com/documentation/latest/changelog.html#major-308\n\nBotmaster is a lightweight chatbot framework. Its purpose is to integrate your existing chatbot into a variety of messaging channels - currently Facebook Messenger, Twitter DM and Telegram.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFind the whole documentation for the framework on: http://botmasterai.com/documentation/latest\n\n## License\n\nThis library is licensed under the MIT [license](LICENSE)\n'
