b'# Node Twitter\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vinitkumar/node-twitter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vinitkumar/node-twitter)\n<img src="https://opencollective.com/nodetwitter/tiers/backer/badge.svg?label=backer&color=brightgreen" />\n\n\nNode twitter is an effort to rewrite some of Twitter\'s functionality using modern\njavascript based toolchain. It was mostly an effort to learn Node.js and trying to reverse\nengineer some of twitter\'s feature.\n\nIt has support for tweeting, commenting and following with analytics\n\nYou can support the development here by becoming a backer: https://opencollective.com/nodetwitter/\n\n<img src="https://cldup.com/smoNHY-9mI.png">\n<img src="https://cldup.com/oEa3EIGhyJ.png">\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou are required to have Node.js and MongoDB installed if you\'d like to run the app locally.\n\n- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)\n- [Mongodb](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)\n\nInstall sass and grunt too to compile the CSS files\n\n```\nsudo npm install -g grunt-cli\nsudo npm install -g sass\n\n```\n\nThe configuration is in `config/config.js`. Please create your own\ngithub application [Github Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/applications) and replace the token and keys.\n\n```js\nvar path = require(\'path\'),\n    rootPath = path.normalize(__dirname + \'/..\');\nmodule.exports = {\n  production: {\n    db: \'\',\n    root: rootPath,\n    app: {\n      name: \'Node Twitter\'\n    },\n    github: {\n      clientID: \'\',\n      clientSecret: \'\',\n      callbackURL: \'\'\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n## Usage via Docker\n\n\nThe fastest way to get this running is with docker. Docker bootstrap all dependencies and\nyou can just run these couple of commands to get it up and running.\n\n```\n# first build the container\ndocker-compose --log-level DEBUG build\n\n# then run the server and mongodb like this:\n\ndocker-compose up\n```\nNow, open the website on http://localhost:3000 and it should just work.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh\n# First install all the project dependencies.\n# run mongodb server\n~/ mongod\n~/node-twitter/ npm install\n# Now run the app\n~/node-twitter/ npm start\n\n> node-twitter@1.1.0 start ~/node-twitter\n> node server.js\n\nExpress app started on port 3000\n```\n\n# Contribute\n\n## Introduction\n\nFirst, thank you for considering contributing to Node Twitter\n\n\n! It\'s people like you that make the open source community such a great community! \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a\n\nWe welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with\n- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)\n- **Marketing**: writing blog posts, howto\'s, printing stickers, ...\n- **Community**: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup for the local community, ...\n- **Code**: take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/vinitkumar/node-twitter/issues). Even if you can\'t write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.\n- **Money**: we welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/nodetwitter/).\n\n## Your First Contribution\n\nWorking on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).\n\n## Submitting code\n\nAny code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.\n\n## Code review process\n\nThe bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.\nIt is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?\n\n## Financial contributions\n\nWe also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/nodetwitter/).\nAnyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.\n\n## Questions\n\nIf you have any questions, create an [issue](issue) (protip: do a quick search first to see if someone else didn\'t ask the same question before!).\nYou can also reach us at mail@vinitkumar.me\n\n## Credits\n\n### Contributors\n\nThank you to all the people who have already contributed to node-twitter!\n\n[![0](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/images/0)](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/links/0)\n[![1](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/images/1)](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/links/1)\n[![2](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/images/2)](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/links/2)\n[![3](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/images/3)](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/links/3)\n[![4](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/images/4)](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/links/4)\n[![5](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/images/5)](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/links/5)\n[![6](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/images/6)](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/links/6)\n[![7](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/images/7)](https://sourcerer.io/fame/vinitkumar/vinitkumar/node-twitter/links/7)\n\n\n### Backers\n\nThank you to all our backers!
