b'# Introduction #\r\n`TweetScraper` can get tweets from [Twitter Search](https://twitter.com/search-home). \r\nIt is built on [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) without using [Twitter\'s APIs](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).\r\nThe crawled data is not as *clean* as the one obtained by the APIs, but the benefits are you can get rid of the API\'s rate limits and restrictions. Ideally, you can get all the data from Twitter Search.\r\n\r\n**WARNING:** please be polite and follow the [crawler\'s politeness policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler#Politeness_policy).\r\n \r\n\r\n# Installation #\r\nIt requires [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) and [PyMongo](https://api.mongodb.org/python/current/) (Also install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) if you want to save the data to database). Setting up:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/jonbakerfish/TweetScraper.git\r\n    $ cd TweetScraper/\r\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt  #add \'--user\' if you are not root\r\n\t$ scrapy list\r\n\t$ #If the output is \'TweetScraper\', then you are ready to go.\r\n\r\n# Usage #\r\n1. Change the `USER_AGENT` in `TweetScraper/settings.py` to identify who you are\r\n\t\r\n\t\tUSER_AGENT = \'your website/e-mail\'\r\n\r\n2. In the root folder of this project, run command like: \r\n\r\n\t\tscrapy crawl TweetScraper -a query="foo,#bar"\r\n\r\n\twhere `query` is a list of keywords seperated by comma and quoted by `"`. The query can be any thing (keyword, hashtag, etc.) you want to search in [Twitter Search](https://twitter.com/search-home). `TweetScraper` will crawl the search results of the query and save the tweet content and user information. You can also use the following operators in each query (from [Twitter Search](https://twitter.com/search-home)):\r\n\t\r\n\t| Operator | Finds tweets... |\r\n\t| --- | --- |\r\n\t| twitter search | containing both "twitter" and "search". This is the default operator. |\r\n\t| **"** happy hour **"** | containing the exact phrase "happy hour". |\r\n\t| love **OR** hate | containing either "love" or "hate" (or both). |\r\n\t| beer **-** root | containing "beer" but not "root". |\r\n\t| **#** haiku | containing the hashtag "haiku". |\r\n\t| **from:** alexiskold | sent from person "alexiskold". |\r\n\t| **to:** techcrunch | sent to person "techcrunch". |\r\n\t| **@** mashable | referencing person "mashable". |\r\n\t| "happy hour" **near:** "san francisco" | containing the exact phrase "happy hour" and sent near "san francisco". |\r\n\t| **near:** NYC **within:** 15mi | sent within 15 miles of "NYC". |\r\n\t| superhero **since:** 2010-12-27 | containing "superhero" and sent since date "2010-12-27" (year-month-day). |\r\n\t| ftw **until:** 2010-12-27 | containing "ftw" and sent up to date "2010-12-27". |\r\n\t| movie -scary **:)** | containing "movie", but not "scary", and with a positive attitude. |\r\n\t| flight **:(** | containing "flight" and with a negative attitude. |\r\n\t| traffic **?** | containing "traffic" and asking a question. |\r\n\t| hilarious **filter:links** | containing "hilarious" and linking to URLs. |\r\n\t| news **source:twitterfeed** | containing "news" and entered via TwitterFeed |\r\n\r\n3. The tweets will be saved to disk in `./Data/tweet/` in default settings and `./Data/user/` is for user data. The file format is JSON. Change the `SAVE_TWEET_PATH` and `SAVE_USER_PATH` in `TweetScraper/settings.py` if you want another location.\r\n\r\n4.  In you want to save the data to MongoDB, change the `ITEM_PIPELINES` in `TweetScraper/settings.py` from `TweetScraper.pipelines.SaveToFilePipeline` to `TweetScraper.pipelines.SaveToMongoPipeline`.\r\n\r\n### Other parameters\r\n* `lang[DEFAULT=\'\']` allow to choose the language of tweet scrapped. This is not part of the query parameters, it is a different part in the search API URL\r\n* `top_tweet[DEFAULT=False]`, if you want to query only top_tweets or all of them\r\n* `crawl_user[DEFAULT=False]`, if you want to crawl users, author\'s of tweets in the same time\r\n\r\nE.g.: `scrapy crawl TweetScraper -a query=foo -a crawl_user=True`\r\n\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgement #\r\nKeeping the crawler up to date requires continuous efforts, we thank all the [contributors](https://github.com/jonbakerfish/TweetScraper/graphs/contributors) for their valuable work.\r\n\r\n\r\n# License #\r\nTweetScraper is released under the [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 2](https://github.com/jonbakerfish/TweetScraper/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\n'
