b'![NetflixOSS Lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/osslifecycle/paulgb/Treeverse.svg)\n\n![Treeverse Icon](extension/common/icons/32.png) Treeverse\n=========\n\nTreeverse is a tool for visualizing and navigating Twitter conversation threads.\n\nIt is available as a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n### Chrome Users:\n\n<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/treeverse/aahmjdadniahaicebomlagekkcnlcila?hl=en">\n    <img src="images/download_chrome.png" alt="Download Treeverse for Chrome" style="width: 206px; height: 58px">\n</a>\n\n### Firefox Users:\n\n<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/treeverse/">\n    <img src="images/download_moz.png" alt="Download Treeverse for Firefox" style="width: 172px; height: 60px">\n</a>\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nAfter installing Treeverse for your browser, open Twitter and click on the tweet that you would like to visualize the conversation of (or try [this one](https://twitter.com/paulgb/status/977652162137395201).)\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re using Chrome, the icon for Treeverse should turn from grey to blue in your browser. Click it to enter Treeverse.\n\n<img src="images/chrome_treeverse.gif" alt="Opening Treeverse in Chrome" style="width: 320px; height: 180px;" />\n\nIf you\'re using Firefox, the icon will be hidden until you open a tweet, and then it will appear in the address bar.\n\n<img src="images/moz_treeverse.gif" alt="Opening Treeverse in Firefox" style="width: 320px; height: 180px;" />\n\nExploring the Conversation\n--------------------------\n\n![Screenshot of Treeverse.](images/treeverse640.gif)\n\nConversations are visualized as a tree. Each box is an individual tweet, and\nan line between two boxes indicates that the lower one is a reply to the upper\none. The color of the line indicates the time duration between the two tweets\n(red is faster, blue is slower.)\n\nAs you hover over nodes, the reply-chain preceeding that tweet appears on the right-side\npane. By clicking a node, you can freeze the UI on that tweet in order to interact with\nthe right-side pane. By clicking anywhere in the tree window, you can un-freeze the tweet\nand return to the normal hover behavior.\n\n![Right pane in action.](images/right_pane.png)\n\nSome tweets will appear with a red circle with white ellipses inside them, either overlayed\non them or as a separate node. This means that\nthere are more replies to that tweet that haven\'t been loaded. Double-clicking a node will\nload additional replies to that tweet.\n\n![More tweets indicator.](images/red_circles.png)\n\nPrivacy\n-------\n\nTreeverse runs entirely in your browser. No data is collected or tracked by Treeverse directly\nwhen you use or install it. Browser extension installs may be tracked by Google and Mozilla, and the data\nrequests made to Twitter may be tracked by Twitter.\n\nWhen you create a sharable link, the data is sent to a server so that it can be made available to other\nusers. Access to the shared link server may be tracked to prevent abuse.\n\nAdditionally, when Treeverse runs it loads a font hosted by Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/). Google may track this download.\n\nBugs & Contact\n--------------\n\nTweet [@paulgb](https://twitter.com/paulgb) or [report on GitHub](https://github.com/paulgb/treeverse/issues).\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nIcon created by [Eli Schiff](http://www.elischiff.com/).\n\nTreeverse would not be possible without the excellent [d3.js](https://d3js.org/).\nStyling is powered by [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/). \n'
