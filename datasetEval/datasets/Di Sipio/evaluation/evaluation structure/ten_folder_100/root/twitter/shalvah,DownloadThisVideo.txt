b'# DownloadThisVideo\nEasily download videos/GIFs off Twitter. Mention the bot (@this_vid) in a reply to the tweet containing the video, and it\'ll reply with a download link in a few minutes.\n\n![](./this-vid.png)\n\n## How this works\n## Stack\n- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) with the [Serverless Framework](http://serverless.com)\n- [AWS SNS](http://aws.amazon.com/sns)\n- [Redis](http://redis.io)\n- Node.js\n\n### Implementation\nThe bot consists of several AWS Lambda functions that work in tandem:\n\n#### fetchTweetsToDownload\nThis function runs every 4 minutes and checks for new mentions. It publishes these new mentions as a new notification on an SNS topic. The 4-minute interval is so as to not hit Twitter\'s rate limits and minimize AWS Lambda usage time, while being near-realtime.\n\n\n#### sendDownloadLink\nThis is triggered by new notifications on the SNS topic. It:\n- processes the tweets in the message body,\n- calls Twitter\'s API to retrieve media links. Any video links retrieved for a tweet are stored in Redis for faster repeated access (other users requesting the same video).\n- adds the download details to the user\'s store in Redis. The _user\'s store_ is an entry in Redis where all downloads requested by a user are cached for a certain period (48 hours).\n- attempts to reply to the user with a link to the user\'s download page (see section below). "Attempts" because  Twitter enforces tweet limits (2400 per day, counted in 15-minute periods). If the API limits have been reached, the bot will "cool down" (not send any replies) for 10 minutes.\n\n#### getDownloads\nThis is triggered by a HTTP request to the <AWS API Gateway URL>/<Twitter-handle> (for instance, http://thisvid.space/jack). It renders a page showing a list of the user\'s recent downloads.\n\n#### getHomePage\nRenders the homepage \xf0\x9f\x98\x81. See http://thisvid.space.\n\n#### retryFailedTasks\nThis re-publishes failed tasks (stored in Redis) as a new SNS message. For now, it can only be triggered manually.\n\n# Supporters\nThese folks help to keep this running.
