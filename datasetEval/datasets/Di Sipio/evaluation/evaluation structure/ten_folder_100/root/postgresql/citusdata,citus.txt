b'![Citus Banner](/github-banner.png)\n\n[![Slack Status](http://slack.citusdata.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.citusdata.com)\n[![Latest Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-brightgreen.svg)](https://docs.citusdata.com/)\n\n### What is Citus?\n\n* **Open-source** PostgreSQL extension (not a fork)\n* **Built to scale out** across multiple nodes\n* **Distributed** engine for query parallelization\n* **Database** designed to scale out multi-tenant applications, real-time analytics dashboards, and high-throughput transactional workloads\n\nCitus is an open source extension to Postgres that distributes your data and your queries across multiple nodes. Because Citus is an extension to Postgres, and not a fork, Citus gives developers and enterprises a scale-out database while keeping the power and familiarity of a relational database. As an extension, Citus supports new PostgreSQL releases, and allows you to benefit from new features while maintaining compatibility with existing PostgreSQL tools.\n\nCitus serves many use cases. Three common ones are:\n\n1. [Multi-tenant & SaaS applications](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/10/03/designing-your-saas-database-for-high-scalability):\nMost B2B applications already have the notion of a tenant /\ncustomer / account built into their data model. Citus allows you to scale out your\ntransactional relational database to 100K+ tenants with minimal changes to your\napplication.\n\n2. [Real-time analytics](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2017/12/27/real-time-analytics-dashboards-with-citus/):\nCitus enables ingesting large volumes of data and running\nanalytical queries on that data in human real-time. Example applications include analytic\ndashboards with sub-second response times and exploratory queries on unfolding events.\n\n3. High-throughput transactional workloads:\nBy distributing your workload across a database cluster, Citus ensures low latency and high performance even with a large number of concurrent users and high volumes of transactions.\n\nTo learn more, visit [citusdata.com](https://www.citusdata.com) and join\nthe [Citus slack](https://slack.citusdata.com/) to\nstay on top of the latest developments.\n\n### Getting started with Citus\n\nThe fastest way to get up and running is to deploy Citus in the cloud. You can also setup a local Citus database cluster with Docker.\n\n#### Hyperscale (Citus) on Azure Database for PostgreSQL\n\nHyperscale (Citus) is a deployment option on Azure Database for PostgreSQL, a fully-managed database as a service. Hyperscale (Citus) employs the Citus open source extension so you can scale out across multiple nodes. To get started with Hyperscale (Citus), [learn more](https://www.citusdata.com/product/hyperscale-citus/) on the Citus website or use the [Hyperscale (Citus) Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/quickstart-create-hyperscale-portal) in the Azure docs.\n\n#### Citus Cloud\n\nCitus Cloud runs on top of AWS as a fully managed database as a service. You can provision a Citus Cloud account at [https://console.citusdata.com](https://console.citusdata.com/users/sign_up) and get started with just a few clicks.\n\n#### Local Citus Cluster\n\nIf you\'re looking to get started locally, you can follow the following steps to get up and running.\n\n1. Install Docker Community Edition and Docker Compose\n  * Mac:\n    1. [Download](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) and install Docker.\n    2. Start Docker by clicking on the application\xe2\x80\x99s icon.\n  * Linux:\n    ```bash\n    curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh\n    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && exec sg docker newgrp `id -gn`\n    sudo systemctl start docker\n\n    sudo curl -sSL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.11.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n    ```\n    The above version of Docker Compose is sufficient for running Citus, or you can install the [latest version](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest).\n\n2. Pull and start the Docker images\n  ```bash\n  curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citusdata/docker/master/docker-compose.yml\n  docker-compose -p citus up -d\n  ```\n\n3. Connect to the master database\n  ```bash\n  docker exec -it citus_master psql -U postgres\n  ```\n\n4. Follow the [first tutorial][tutorial] instructions\n5. To shut the cluster down, run\n\n  ```bash\n  docker-compose -p citus down\n  ```\n\n### Talk to Contributors and Learn More\n\n<table class="tg">\n<col width="45%">\n<col width="65%">\n<tr>\n  <td>Documentation</td>\n  <td>Try the <a\n  href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/tutorials/multi-tenant-tutorial.html">Citus\n  tutorial</a> for a hands-on introduction or <br/>the <a\n  href="https://docs.citusdata.com">documentation</a> for\n  a more comprehensive reference.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Slack</td>\n  <td>Chat with us in our community <a\n  href="https://slack.citusdata.com">Slack channel</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Github Issues</td>\n  <td>We track specific bug reports and feature requests on our <a\n  href="https://github.com/citusdata/citus/issues">project\n  issues</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Twitter</td>\n  <td>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/citusdata">@citusdata</a>\n  for general updates and PostgreSQL scaling tips.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Citus Blog</td>\n  <td>Read our <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/">Citus Data Blog</a>\n  for posts on Postgres, Citus, and scaling your database.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n### Contributing\n\nCitus is built on and of open source, and we welcome your contributions.\nThe [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file explains how to get started\ndeveloping the Citus extension itself and our code quality guidelines.\n\n### Who is Using Citus?\n\nCitus is deployed in production by many customers, ranging from\ntechnology start-ups to large enterprises.
