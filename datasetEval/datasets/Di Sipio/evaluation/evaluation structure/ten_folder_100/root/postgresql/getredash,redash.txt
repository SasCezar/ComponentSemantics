What we were looking for was a more hacker\'ish way to look at data, so we built one.\n\n**_Redash_** was built to allow fast and easy access to billions of records, that we process and collect using Amazon Redshift ("petabyte scale data warehouse" that "speaks" PostgreSQL).\nToday **_Redash_** has support for querying multiple databases, including: Redshift, Google BigQuery, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Graphite, Presto, Google Spreadsheets, Cloudera Impala, Hive and custom scripts.\n\n**_Redash_** consists of two parts:\n\n1. **Query Editor**: think of [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) for SQL queries. It\'s your way to share data in the organization in an open way, by sharing both the dataset and the query that generated it. This way everyone can peer review not only the resulting dataset but also the process that generated it. Also it\'s possible to fork it and generate new datasets and reach new insights.\n2. **Visualizations and Dashboards**: once you have a dataset, you can create different visualizations out of it, and then combine several visualizations into a single dashboard. Currently Redash supports charts, pivot table, cohorts and [more](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/visualizations/visualization-types).\n\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getredash/website/8e820cd02c73a8ddf4f946a9d293c54fd3fb08b9/website/_assets/images/redash-anim.gif" width="80%"/>\n\n## Getting Started\n\n* [Setting up Redash instance](https://redash.io/help/open-source/setup) (includes links to ready made AWS/GCE images).\n* [Documentation](https://redash.io/help/).\n\n## Supported Data Sources\n\nRedash supports more than 35 [data sources](https://redash.io/help/data-sources/supported-data-sources). \n\n## Getting Help\n\n* Issues: https://github.com/getredash/redash/issues\n* Discussion Forum: https://discuss.redash.io/\n\n## Reporting Bugs and Contributing Code\n\n* Want to report a bug or request a feature?
