This includes hundreds of solvable exercises organized into several categories covering the basics of the Scala language and its most important libraries.\n\n- LEARN: Each category includes an explanation of the basics. Learn the concepts through simple code samples.\n\n- SOLVE: Each exercise is a unit test that must pass successfully\xe2\x80\x94complete the exercise by filling in the blanks. Receive instant feedback as your answers are validated in real-time.\n\n- SHARE: The system will consider the category complete when all its exercises are successfully done. Don\'t forget to share your progress on social networks before moving on to the next category!\n\n- EDIT: After completing a category, you\'ll be able to go back and edit it. Add new exercises or improve existing ones by sending a pull request.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Online\n\nScala Exercises is available at [scala-exercises.org](https://scala-exercises.org).\n\n### Local development\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- Install JDK 8, either the [Oracle version](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) or [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/)\n- Install [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/download/)\n- Install [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)\n- Install [PostgreSQL 9.4](http://www.postgresql.org/download/)\n- Install the [Sass Ruby gem](http://sass-lang.com/install) and make sure the `sass` program can be run\n- Install [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) with `npm install jsdom`\n\n#### Installing the app locally\n\n##### Get the repository\nFirst of all, either clone the repository via git\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/scala-exercises/scala-exercises\n```\n\nor download it\n\n```sh\n$ wget https://github.com/scala-exercises/scala-exercises/archive/master.zip\n```\n##### Configure the database\n\nYou\'ll need a working [PostgreSQL 9.4](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) database and user for running the app. Once the database is running,\n\n- Create a user called `scalaexercises_dev_user`\n\n```sh\n$ sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER scalaexercises_dev_user WITH PASSWORD \'a_password\';"\n```\n\n- Create a db called `scalaexercises_dev` and grant all privileges on it to `scalaexercises_dev_user`\n\n```sh\n$ sudo -u postgres createdb scalaexercises_dev\n$ sudo -u postgres psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE scalaexercises_dev TO scalaexercises_dev_user;"\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use Docker to run the database. The following command creates a database container and exposes it:\n\n```sh\n$ docker run --name scala-exercises-db -e POSTGRES_DB=scalaexercises_dev -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=scalaexercises_pass -e POSTGRES_USER=scalaexercises_dev_user -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:9.4\n```\n\n##### Configure the application\n\nEdit the `server/conf/application.dev.conf` configuration file with your database information.\n\n#### Running the app\n\nGo into the project\'s root directory, run `sbt server/run` with `-mem` option to increase the memory.\n\n```sh\n$ sbt -mem 1500 server/run\n```\n\nAfter compilation, the application will be running, listening in the 9000 port. Point your browser\nto `localhost:9000` and start having fun!\n\n#### Running the tests\n\nTo run the tests (for the `server` project), you need to add a test database and a test user.\n\n- Create a user called `scalaexercises_user`\n\n```sh\n$ sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER scalaexercises_user WITH PASSWORD \'scalaexercises_pass\';"\n```\n\n- Create a db called `scalaexercises_test` and grant all privileges on it to `scalaexercises_user`\n\n```sh\n$ sudo -u postgres createdb scalaexercises_test\n$ sudo -u postgres psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE scalaexercises_test TO scalaexercises_user;"\n```\n\n#### Adding more exercises\n\nCurrently, scala-exercises includes exercises for the Scala Standard Library, Cats, and Shapeless. However, more exercises are available, like for Doobie, Functional Programming in Scala, and ScalaCheck. See the [scala-exercises on github](https://github.com/scala-exercises), or you can include exercises from other parties or create your own (see [Contributing](#contributing) section).\n\nTo add additional exercises to your locally running server:\n* clone the exercises repository to a local folder\n* \'cd\' into the local repository folder.\n* run ```sbt compile publishLocal``` to create a jar in your local ivy repository.  \n!Note: The _compile_ task is **mandatory** here otherwise the exercises will not show up in the application.\n* add a dependency to the exersises jar in the `server` project in the `build.sbt` file (~L118).\n\nNow run `sbt server/run` and the application index will also display the added exercises.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n#### Additional exercises do not show up in the application\n\nSee the [Adding more exercises](#adding-more-exercises) section. Note that, currently, the `compile` step is required before `publishLocal` for the application to be able to pickup the exercises.\n\n#### Ensime\n\nIf you use *ensime* and you have configured the `sbt-ensime` plugin in your sbt user\nglobal settings, it\'s likely you might have this issue running the application locally:\n\n```java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scalariform/formatter/preferences/SpacesAroundMultiImports$```\n\nIn that case, you could solve this issue setting up your `/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugins.sbt` file\nas follows:\n\n```scala\naddSbtPlugin("org.ensime" % "ensime-sbt" % "0.5.1")\n\ndependencyOverrides in ThisBuild += "org.scalariform" %% "scalariform" % "0.1.8"\n```\n\nIn order to avoid the error related to `Github API rate limit exceeded` during compilation of exercises, we recommend setting a local environment variable called `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a personal token that you can create [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).\n\nWhile creating the PostgreSQL database, you may run into problems following the previous instructions if developing on a MacOS X environment. In that case, we recommend using the following alternatives:\n\n- Create a user called `scalaexercises_dev_user`. Note that, if you installed PostgreSQL using Homebrew, your superuser may be different than `postgres`:\n\n```sh\n$ psql -U your_postgres_user -c "CREATE USER scalaexercises_dev_user WITH PASSWORD \'a_password\';"\n```\n\n- Create a db called `scalaexercises_dev` and grant all privileges on it to `scalaexercises_dev_user`:\n\n```sh\n$ createdb scalaexercises_dev\n$ psql -U your_postgres_user -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE scalaexercises_dev TO scalaexercises_dev_user;"\n```\n\n## Project structure\n\nThe project is split between a few directories, namely:\n- `server`, which contains the server code written using Play,\n- `client`, which contains ScalaJS code for a frontend part of the application,\n- `shared`, where code shared between the server and the client exists,\n- `definitions`, containing definitions used by other parts of the application and libraries containing exercises,\n- `sbt-exercise` is a sbt plugin that locates exercise libraries and processes their source code,\n- `compiler` for compiling exercises,\n- `runtime` for runtime evaluation of exercises.\n\nThe `compiler` and `runtime` directories allow exercises to be defined using\nregular Scala, which is compiled into an exercise library.\n\nThe `site`, `client`, and `shared` directories contain the website. These items depend on components in `compiler` and `runtime`.\n\nAt the moment, those subprojects are coupled tightly. Once this project\nis a bit more stable, the exercise compiler plugin will be published, and it will\nbe easy to create new exercises for existing Scala libraries.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
