b'> **This repository is no longer active**. If you\'re looking for a simple and powerful hosted form API, please check out [https://formspree.io](https://formspree.io). If you are interested in self-hosting the code in this repository, you may do so while complying with the LICENSE file. However, Formspree can\'t offer support.\n\n\nFORMSPREE.IO\n------------\n\nFunctional HTML forms. Hosted at [https://formspree.io](https://formspree.io).\n\nJust send your form to our URL and we\'ll forward it to your email. No PHP, Javascript or sign up required \xe2\x80\x94 perfect for static sites!\nExample:\n\n```html\n<form action="https://formspree.io/you@email.com">\n    <input type="text" name="name">\n    <input type="email" name="_replyto">\n    <input type="submit" value="Send">\n</form>\n```\n\nSetting it up is easy and free. Here\'s how:\n\nYou don\'t even have to register.\n\n## 1. Setup the HTML form\n\nChange your form\'s action-attribute to this and replace your@email.com with your own email.\n\n## 2. Submit the form and confirm your email address\n\nGo to your website and submit the form once. This will send you an email asking to confirm your email address, so that no one can start sending you spam from random websites.\n\n## 3. All set, receive emails\n\nFrom now on, when someone submits that form, we\'ll forward you the data as email.\n\n## Advanced features:\n\nForm inputs can have specially named name-attributes, which alter functionality. They are all prefixed with an underscore.\n\n### _replyto\n\nThis value is used for the email\'s Reply-To field. This way you can directly "Reply" to the email to respond to the person who originally submitted the form.\n\n### _next\n\nBy default, after submitting a form the user is shown the Formspree "Thank You" page. You can provide an alternative URL for that page.\n\n### _subject\n\nThis value is used for the email\'s subject, so that you can quickly reply to submissions without having to edit the subject line each time.\n\n### _cc\n\nThis value is used for the email\'s CC Field. This lets you send a copy of each submission to another email address. If you want to cc multiple emails, simply make the cc field a list of emails each separated by a comma.\n\n### _gotcha\n\nAdd this "honeypot" field to avoid spam by fooling scrapers. If a value is provided, the submission will be silently ignored. The input should be hidden with CSS.\n\n### Using AJAX\n\nFormspree Gold users can submit forms via AJAX. This even works cross-origin. The trick is to set the Accept header to application/json. If you\'re using jQuery this can be done like so:\n\n```javascript\n$.ajax({\n    url: "https://formspree.io/FORM_ID",\n    method: "POST",\n    data: {message: "hello!"},\n    dataType: "json"\n});\n```\n\n--------\n\nIf you are experiencing issues, please take a look at the [FAQ](../../wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) in the wiki\n\n\nRunning your own copy of Formspree\n----------------------------------\n\n### Running on localhost\n\nYou\'ll need a [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) account, PostgreSQL, Redis and Python 2.7 and should install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html), and create a [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) for the server.\n\nOnce your environment is setup, create a postgresql database, clone the source and cd into the root of the Formspree repository. Then run:\n\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nthen create a `.env` file with your configuration like the following:\n\n    API_ROOT=\'http://127.0.0.1:5000\'\n    CONTACT_EMAIL=\'support@example.com\'\n    DATABASE_URL=\'postgresql://<username>@127.0.0.1:5432/formspree\'\n    DEBUG=\'True\'\n    DEFAULT_SENDER=\'no-reply@localhost.com\'\n    LOG_LEVEL=\'debug\'\n    MONTHLY_SUBMISSIONS_LIMIT=\'100\'\n    NONCE_SECRET=\'y0ur_n0nc3_s3cr3t\'\n    HASHIDS_SALT=\'a salt\'\n    REDISTOGO_URL=\'127.0.0.1:6379\'\n    SECRET_KEY=\'y0ur_s3cr3t_k3y\'\n    SENDGRID_PASSWORD=\'<password>\'\n    SENDGRID_USERNAME=\'<username>\'\n    SERVICE_NAME=\'LocalFormspree\'\n    SERVICE_URL=\'http://127.0.0.1:5000\'\n    TEST_DATABASE_URL=\'postgresql://<username>@127.0.0.1:5432/formspree-test\'\n\nTell the Flask CLI about the application by typing `export FLASK_APP=manage.py` or if using a virtualenv you can [add it to the `activate` script](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/cli/#virtualenv-integration)\n\nMake sure you have a postgresql database called `formspree` and create the necessary tables by running:\n\n    flask db upgrade\n\nAnd you are ready to run the server:\n\n    flask run\n\n### Running tests\n\n    REDISTOGO_URL=\'0.0.0.0:6379\' \\\n    TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>@127.0.0.1:5432/formspree-test \\\n    NONCE_SECRET=\'y0ur_n0nc3_s3cr3t\' \\\n    HASHIDS_SALT=\'a salt\' \\\n    SECRET_KEY=\'y0ur_s3cr3t_k3y\' \\\n    STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=\'<STRIPE PUBLISHABLE>\' \\\n    STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY=\'<STRIPE SECRET>\' \\\n    python -m unittest discover\n    \nMake sure that you do **NOT** use your actual `formspree` database when running tests. Doing so will cause you to lose all data located in your `formspree` database. Instead create a new database called `formspree-test`.\n\nYou can also use [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to automate running tests. After installing, run `foreman run venv/bin/python -m unittest discover` to run the entire test suite. To run a single test file, run `foreman run venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.test_users`. In this case, it will run only `tests/test_users.py`.\n\n### Running on Heroku\n\nYou will need to install the [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).\n\nOnce your environment is setup, clone the source and cd into the root of the Formspree repository. Then run:\n\n    heroku apps:create [your project name]\n\nthen\n\n    git push heroku\n\nYour new project will be running at [your project name].herokuapp.com.\n\n\n### Dependencies\n\nFormspree requires a PostgreSQL database and uses SendGrid to send emails. If you\'re deploying to Heroku you can get a free Heroku Postgres database and a SendGrid account by running\n\n    heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev\n    heroku addons:create sendgrid\n\n### Configuring Formspree\n\nTake a look at the `formspree/settings.py` file for a list of environment variables that should be set in order for Formspree to work correctly.\n\n\n\nContributing\n----------------------------------\n\nFormspree is an open source project managed on GitHub.
