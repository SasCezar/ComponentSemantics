See [COPYRIGHT](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/blob/develop/COPYRIGHT) for a full list.\n\n\n## INSTALLING\n\n### Simple setup\n\nIf you have low technical skills and you\'re looking to install Dolibarr ERP/CRM in just a few clicks, you can use one of the packaged versions:\n\n- DoliWamp for Windows\n- DoliDeb for Debian or Ubuntu\n- DoliRpm for Redhat, Fedora, OpenSuse, Mandriva or Mageia\n\nReleases can be downloaded from [official website](https://www.dolibarr.org/).\n\n### Advanced setup\n\nYou can use a Web server and a supported database (MariaDB, MySQL or PostgreSQL) to install the standard version.\n\n- Uncompress the downloaded .zip archive to copy the "dolibarr/htdocs" directory and all its files inside your web server root or get the files directly from GitHub (recommanded if you known git): \n\n  git clone https://github.com/dolibarr/dolibarr -b x.y     (where x.y is main version like 3.6, 9.0, ...)\n\n- Set up your web server to use "*dolibarr/htdocs*" as root if your web server does not have an already defined directory to point to. \n \n- Create an empty `htdocs/conf/conf.php` file and set *write* permissions for your web server user (*write* permission will be removed once install is finished)\n\n- From your browser, go to the dolibarr "install/" page\n\n    The URL will depends on how you web setup was setup to point to your dolibarr installation. It may looks like:\n\n        http://localhost/dolibarr/htdocs/install/\n        \n    or\n    \n        http://localhost/dolibarr/install/\n        \n    or\n    \n    \thttp://yourdolibarrvirtualhost/install/\n   \n- Follow the installer instructions\n\n### Saas/Cloud setup\n\nIf you don\'t have time to install it yourself, you can try some commercial \'ready to use\' Cloud offers (See https://saas.dolibarr.org). However, this third solution is not free.\n\n\n\n## UPGRADING\n\n- At first make a backup of your Dolibarr files & than see https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Installation_-_Upgrade#Upgrade_Dolibarr \n- Overwrite all old files from \'dolibarr\' directory with files provided into the new version\'s package.\n- At first next access, Dolibarr will redirect your to the "install/" page to follow the upgrade process.\n \xc2\xa0If an `install.lock` file exists to lock any other upgrade process, the application will ask you to remove the file manually (you should find the `install.lock` file into the directory used to store generated and uploaded documents, in most cases, it is the directory called "*documents*").\n\n*Note: migration process can be safely done multiple times by calling the `/install/index.php` page*\n\n\n## WHAT\'S NEW\n\nSee the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/blob/develop/ChangeLog) file.\n\n\n## FEATURES\n\n### Main application/modules (all optional)\n\n- Customers, Prospects (Leads) and/or Suppliers directory\n- Products and/or Services catalog\n- Commercial proposals management\n- Customer and Supplier Orders management\n- Invoices and payment management\n- Standing orders management (European SEPA)\n- Bank accounts management\n- Accounting management\n- Shared calendar/agenda (with ical and vcal export for third party tools integration)\n- Opportunities and/or project management\n- Projects management\n- Contracts management\n- Warehouse/Stock management\n- Shipping management\n- Interventions management\n- Employee\'s leave requests management\n- Expense reports\n- Timesheets\n- Electronic Document Management (EDM)\n- Foundations members management\n- Mass emailing\n- Surveys\n- Point of Sale (POS) \n- \xe2\x80\xa6\n\n### Other application/modules\n\n- Bookmarks management\n- Donations management\n- Reporting\n- Data export/import\n- Barcodes support\n- Margin calculations\n- LDAP connectivity\n- ClickToDial integration\n- RSS integration\n- Skype integration\n- Payment platforms integration (PayPal, Stripe, Paybox...)\n- \xe2\x80\xa6\n\n### Other general features\n\n- Localization in most major languages\n- Multi-Users and groups with finely grained rights\n- Multi-currency\n- Multi-company by adding of an external module\n- Very user friendly and easy to use\n- customizable Dashboard\n- Highly customizable: enable only the modules you need, add user personalized fields, choose your skin, several menu managers (can be used by internal users as a back-office with a particular menu, or by external users as a front-office with another one)\n\n- APIs\n- An easy to understand, maintain and develop code (PHP with no heavy framework; trigger and hook architecture)\n- Support a lot of country specific features:\n    - Spanish Tax RE and ISPF\n    - French NPR VAT rate (VAT called "Non Per\xc3\xa7ue R\xc3\xa9cup\xc3\xa9rable" for DOM-TOM)\n    - Canadian double taxes (federal/province) and other countries using cumulative VAT\n    - Tunisian tax stamp\n    - Argentina invoice numbering using A,B,C... \n    - Compatible with [European directives](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/taxation/l31057_en.htm) (2006/112/CE ... 2010/45/UE)\n    - Compatible with European GDPR rules\n    - ...\n- PDF or ODT generation for invoice, proposals, orders...\n- \xe2\x80\xa6\n\n### System Environment / Requirements\n\n- Works with PHP 5.5+ and MariaDB 5.0.3+, MySQL 5.0.3+ or PostgreSQL 8.1.4+ (See requirements on the [Wiki](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Prerequisite))\n- Compatible with all Cloud solutions that match MySQL, PHP or PostgreSQL prerequisites.\n\n\n### Extending\n\nDolibarr can be extended with a lot of other external application or modules from third party developers available at the [DoliStore](https://www.dolistore.com).\n\n\n## WHAT DOLIBARR CAN\'T DO YET\n\nThese are features that Dolibarr does **not** yet fully support:\n\n- Tasks dependencies in projects\n- Payroll module\n- No native embedded Webmail\n- Dolibarr can\'t do coffee (yet)\n\n\n## DOCUMENTATION\n\nAdministrator, user, developer and translator\'s documentations are available along with other community resources on the [Wiki](https://wiki.dolibarr.org).\n\n\n## CONTRIBUTING\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
