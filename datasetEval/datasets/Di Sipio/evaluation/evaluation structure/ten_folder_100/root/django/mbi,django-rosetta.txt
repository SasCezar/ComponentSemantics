Rosetta can be installed and uninstalled by simply adding and removing a single entry in your project's `INSTALLED_APPS` and a single line in your main ``urls.py`` file.\n\nNote: as of version 0.7.13 django-rosetta requires Django 1.8 or later. As of version 0.9.0, django-rosetta requires Django 1.11 or later.\n\n********\nFeatures\n********\n\n* Database independent\n* Reads and writes your project's `gettext` catalogs (po and mo files)\n* Installed and uninstalled in under a minute\n* Uses Django's admin interface CSS\n\n\n*************\nDocumentation\n*************\n\nPlease refer to the `online documentation <http://django-rosetta.readthedocs.org/>`_ to install Rosetta and get started.\n"
