We therefore think of\npretix as being stable and ready to use.\n\nIf you want to use or extend pretix, we strongly recommend to follow our `blog`_. We will announce all\nreleases there. You can always find the latest stable version on PyPI or in the ``release/X.Y`` branch of\nthis repository. The ``master`` branch contains a development version that we also try to keep stable in\nthe sense that it does not break your data,  but its APIs might change without prior notice.\n\nTo get started using pretix on your own server, look at the `installation guide`_ in our documentation.\n\nThis project is 100 percent free and open source software. If you are interested in commercial support,\nhosting services or supporting this project financially, please go to `pretix.eu`_ or contact us at\nsupport@pretix.eu.\n\nContributing\n------------\nIf you want to contribute to pretix, please read the `developer documentation`_\nin our documentation.
