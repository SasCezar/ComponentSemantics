b"\xef\xbb\xbfThank you for downloading wger Workout Manager. wger (\xcb\x88v\xc9\x9b\xc9\xa1\xc9\x90) is a free, open source web\napplication that manages your exercises and personal workouts, weight and diet\nplans. It can also be used as a simple gym management utility, providing different\nadministrative roles (trainer, manager, etc.). It offers a REST API as well, for\neasy integration with other projects and tools.\n\nIt is written with python/django and uses jQuery and some D3js for charts.\n\nFor more details and a live system, refer to the project's site: https://wger.de/\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThese are the basic steps to install and run the application locally on a Linux\nsystem. There are more detailed instructions, other deployment options as well\nas an administration guide available at https://wger.readthedocs.io or locally\nin your code repository in the docs folder (``make html`` to compile, then open\n_build/index.html).\n\nPlease consult the commands' help for further information and available\nparameters.\n\n\nDocker\n------\n\nUseful to just try it out::\n\n    docker run -ti --name wger.apache --publish 8000:80 wger/apache\n\nThen just open http://localhost:8000 and log in as: **admin**, password **admin**\n\nAlternatively, there are docker images for development as well, ``wger/devel``\nand ``wger/devel-fedora``. Each image contains an instance of the application\nrunning with django's development server using a sqlite database and can be\nused to quickly setup a development instance (vim and tmux are already\ninstalled). The only difference is that devel has an ubuntu base image while\ndevel-fedora uses fedora.\n\n::\n\n $ docker run -ti --name wger.devel --publish 8000:8000 wger/devel\n\nThen, *within the docker image*, activate the virtualenv\n\n::\n\n  $ source ~/venv/bin/activate\n\nand start the development server\n\n::\n\n $ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000\n\nThen just open http://localhost:8000 and log in as: **admin**, password **admin**\n\n\nDevelopment version (from git)\n------------------------------\n\n**Note:** You can safely install from master, it is almost always in a usable\nand stable state.\n\n\n1) Install the necessary packages\n\n::\n\n $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev python-virtualenv nodejs nodejs-legacy npm libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev git\n\n\nThen install the python packages from pypi in the virtualenv::\n\n $ virtualenv --python python3 venv-django\n $ source venv-django/bin/activate\n\n\n2) Start the application. This will download the required JS and CSS libraries\n   and create a SQlite database and populate it with data on the first run.\n\n::\n\n $ git clone https://github.com/wger-project/wger.git\n $ cd wger\n $ pip install -r requirements.txt  # or requirements_devel.txt to develop\n $ python setup.py develop\n $ wger create_settings \\\n        --settings-path /path/to/current/folder/settings.py \\\n        --database-path /path/to/current/folder/database.sqlite\n $ wger bootstrap \\\n        --settings-path /path/to/current/folder/settings.py \\\n        --no-start-server\n $ python manage.py runserver\n\n3) Log in as: **admin**, password **admin**\n\nAfter the first run you can just use django's development server::\n\n $ python manage.py runserver\n\n\nStable version (from PyPI)\n--------------------------\n\n1) Install the necessary packages and their dependencies in a virtualenv\n\n::\n\n $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev python-virtualenv nodejs nodejs-legacy npm libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev\n $ virtualenv venv-django\n $ source venv-django/bin/activate\n $ pip install wger\n\n\n2) Start the application. This will download the required JS and CSS libraries\n   and create a SQlite database and populate it with data on the first run.\n   Then, log in as: **admin**, password **admin**\n::\n\n $ wger bootstrap\n\n\n3) To start the installation again, just call wger start::\n\n  $ wger start\n\n\nCommand line options\n--------------------\nYou can get a list of all available commands by calling ``wger`` without any\narguments::\n\n    Available tasks:\n\n    bootstrap               Performs all steps necessary to bootstrap the application\n    config_location         Returns the default location for the settings file and the data folder\n    create_or_reset_admin   Creates an admin user or resets the password for an existing one\n    create_settings         Creates a local settings file\n    load_fixtures           Loads all fixtures\n    migrate_db              Run all database migrations\n    start                   Start the application using django's built in webserver\n\nYou can also get help on a specific command with ``wger --help <command>``.\n\nContact\n=======\n\nFeel free to contact us if you found this useful or if there was something that\ndidn't behave as you expected.
