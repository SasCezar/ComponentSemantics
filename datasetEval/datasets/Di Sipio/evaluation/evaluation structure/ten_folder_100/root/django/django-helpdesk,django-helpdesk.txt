All Rights Reserved.\nSee LICENSE for details.\n\ndjango-helpdesk was formerly known as Jutda Helpdesk, named after the\ncompany which originally created it. As of January 2011 the name has been\nchanged to reflect what it really is: a Django-powered ticket tracker with\ncontributors reaching far beyond Jutda.\n\nComplete documentation is available in the docs/ directory,\nor online at http://django-helpdesk.readthedocs.org/.\n\nYou can see a demo installation at http://django-helpdesk-demo.herokuapp.com/,\nor run a demo locally in just a couple steps!\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\ndjango-helpdesk is licensed under terms of the BSD 3-clause license.\nSee the file 'LICENSE' for full licensing terms.\n\nNote that django-helpdesk is distributed with 3rd party products which\nhave their own licenses. See LICENSE.3RDPARTY for license terms for\nincluded packages.\n\nDemo Quickstart\n---------------\n\ndjango-helpdesk includes a basic demo Django project so that you may easily\nget started with testing or developing django-helpdesk. The demo project\nresides in the `demo/` top-level folder.\n\nIt's likely that you can start up a demo project server by running\nonly the command::\n\n    make rundemo\n\nthen pointing your web browser at `localhost:8080`.\n\nFor more information and options, please read the `demo/README.rst` file.\n\n**NOTE REGARDING SQLITE AND SEARCHING:**\nThe demo project uses `sqlite` as its database. Sqlite does not allow\ncase-insensitive searches and so the search function may not work as\neffectively as it would on other database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL\nthat does support case-insensitive searches.\nFor more information, see this note_ in the Django documentation.\n\nWhen you try to do a keyword search using `sqlite`, a message will be displayed\nto alert you to this shortcoming. There is no way around it, sorry.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n`django-helpdesk` requires:\n\n* Django 1.11.x\n* either Python 2.7 or 3.6+ (likely 3.4+ still works though, but unsupported)\n\n**NOTE REGARDING PYTHON VERSION:**\nThe recommended combination is Python 3.6+ with Django 1.11.\nSupport for Python 2 will end in the next versions of both `django-helpdesk`\nand Django itself (Django 2.0), so users and developers are encouraged to begin\ntransitioning to Python 3 if have not already. New projects should definitely\nuse Python 3!\n\n**NOTE REGARDING DJANGO VERSION:**\nThe recommended release is Django 1.11. However, there initial support of\nDjango 2.x as of version 0.2.7 if you'd like to try it out.\nPlease report any bugs you find!\n\nYou can quickly install the latest stable version of `django-helpdesk`\napp via `pip`::\n\n    pip install django-helpdesk\n\nYou may also check out the `master` branch on GitHub, and install manually::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\nEither way, you will need to add `django-helpdesk` to an existing\nDjango project.\n\nFor further installation information see `docs/install.html`\nand `docs/configuration.html`\n\nUpgrading from previous versions\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you are upgrading from a previous version of `django-helpdesk` that used\nmigrations, get an up to date version of the code base (eg by using\n`git pull` or `pip install --upgrade django-helpdesk`) then migrate the database::\n\n    python manage.py migrate helpdesk --db-dry-run # DB untouched\n    python manage.py migrate helpdesk\n\nLastly, restart your web server software (eg Apache) or FastCGI instance, to\nensure the latest changes are in use.\n\nUnfortunately we are unable to assist if you are upgrading from a\nversion of `django-helpdesk` prior to migrations (ie pre-2011).\n\nYou can continue to the 'Initial Configuration' area, if needed.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nWe're happy to include any type of contribution! This can be:\n\n* back-end python/django code development\n* front-end web development (HTML/Javascript, especially jQuery)\n* language translations\n* writing improved documentation and demos\n\nFor more information on contributing, please see the `CONTRIBUTING.rst` file.\n\n.. _note: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/databases/#sqlite-string-matching\n"
