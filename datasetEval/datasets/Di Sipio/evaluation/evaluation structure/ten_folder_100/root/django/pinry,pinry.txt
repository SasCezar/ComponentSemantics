b'|Pinry|\n=======\n\nThe open-source core of Pinry, a tiling image board system for people\nwho want to save, tag, and share images, videos and webpages in an easy\nto skim through format.\n\nFor more information visit `getpinry.com`_.\n\nFeature\n-----------------\n\n- Image fetch and online preview\n- Tagging system for Pin\n- `Chrome/Firefox plugin support <https://github.com/winkidney/browser-pinry>`_\n- multi-user support\n- Both public and private is supported\n\n\nSetup Guide for users\n--------------------------\n\nPlease use docker to install `pinry <https://github.com/pinry/pinry>`_\n\nDevelopers or users who are familiar with python/nginx could setup Pinry with following guide : )\n\nQuick Start for Developers\n----------------------------\n\nYou need only three following lines to initialize your pinry::\n\n  make bootstrap\n  make serve\n\nNow the development server has been running, enjoy : )\n\n\nUpgrade from old version\n--------------------------\n\nOur currently version is 2.x, If you are old user of Pinry,\nplease follow document below to upgrade to 2.x.\n\nFor source code users:\n\nRead our `online doc <doc/upgrade_from_1.x.md>`_ about how to upgrade to 2.x\n\nFor docker users, please contact us for help: )\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nPinry is built on top of Django and optimized to run on a Linux\nenvironment. However we have gotten Pinry to work on Windows and Mac as\nwell but it may require some extra digging around configuration. Pinry\'s\nPython requirements are all in the ``Pipfile`` file. You can easily install\nthese using pipenv, to get pipenv, if you already have Python and pip, run\npython ``pip install pipenv``.\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nWe have many tests built into Pinry to ensure that changes don\'t break\nanything. If you are live dangerously and have cutting edge new Pinry\nfeatures first you can use our master branch for your own instance. We\nrecommend using our tags/versions though.\n\nTo run Pinry\'s tests inside the Pinry repo run::\n\n    pipenv install --dev --three\n    pipenv run python manage.py test\n\n\nDocker\n------\n\nFollow the steps below to install Pinry locally or on any server. This\nprocess installs the minimal requirements to run Pinry. For development\nrequirements and procedures, see testing above.\n\nCurrent docker configuration will just mount source code directory to\ndocker app directory and run any codes existed in current git branch,\nyou may also add "local_settings.py" to customize settings without\nchanging settings file in `pinry/settings`.\n\n- Install the requirements:\n    - Docker\n    - Docker Compose\n\n- Set any custom configuration options you need and run::\n\n    cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml\n    # edit docker-compose.yml and change the secret-key,\n    # don\'t forget to backup this config file.\n    docker-compose up -d\n\n- If you want to run Pinry with current user in docker::\n\n    ./start_docker_with_current_user.sh [-d]\n\n- Bootstrap the database(optional)::\n\n    docker-compose exec web python3 manage.py migrate --settings=pinry.settings.docker\n\n\n**Note** : No static file server configured, your should configure nginx or other server to serve\nstatic files from ./static\n\nLinting\n-------\n\nSo everything isn\'t a mess::\n\n    pipenv run flake8 --exclude=migrations\n\n\nContributors\n------------\n\nThe core contributors for Pinry have been/currently are:\n\n* Isaac Bythewood <http://isaacbythewood.com/>\n* Krzysztof Klimonda\n* Lapo Luchini <https://github.com/lapo-luchini>\n\nFor a full list of contributors check out the `GitHub Contributors Graph`_.\n\n\n..
