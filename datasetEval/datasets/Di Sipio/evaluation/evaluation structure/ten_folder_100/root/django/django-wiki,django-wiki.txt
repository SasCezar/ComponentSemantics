Django 3.0 support is pending support in various dependencies.**\n\nThe below table explains which Django versions are supported.\n\n+------------------+----------------+--------------+\n| Release          | Django         | Upgrade from |\n+==================+================+==============+\n| 0.5.x            | 2.1, 2.2, 3.0  | 0.4          |\n+------------------+----------------+--------------+\n| 0.4.x            | 1.11, 2.0, 2.1 | 0.3          |\n+------------------+----------------+--------------+\n| 0.3.x            | 1.8, 1.9,      | 0.2          |\n|                  | 1.10, 1.11     |              |\n+------------------+----------------+--------------+\n| 0.2.x            | 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 | 0.1          |\n+------------------+----------------+--------------+\n| 0.1.x            | 1.5, 1.6, 1.7  | 0.0.24       |\n+------------------+----------------+--------------+\n| 0.0.24           | 1.4, 1.5, 1.6  | 0.0.?        |\n|                  | 1.7 (unstable) |              |\n+------------------+----------------+--------------+\n\nFor upgrade instructions, please refer to the `Release\nNotes <https://django-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release_notes.html>`__\n\n\nTranslations (Transifex)\n------------------------\n\nDjango-wiki has almost fully translated into 12 languages, apart from the\ndefault (English). But please help out in adding more languages! It\'s\nvery easy, you don\'t even need to be a programmer.\n\nSome languages...\n\n* Just need a little push, as they are almost fully complete\n* Got initiatied and need a new instigator to carry on the ambitions\n* Do not exist yet - but you can request them and become the coordinator.\n\n`Visit the django-wiki project on Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/django-wiki/django-wiki/>`__\n\nDemo\n----\n\nA demo running the latest ``master`` is available here, sign up for an\naccount to see the notification system.\n\nhttps://demo.django-wiki.org\n\nCommunity\n---------\n\nPlease use our IRC or mailing list (google group) for getting in touch\non development and support. Please do not email developers asking for\npersonal support.\n\n- #django-wiki on irc.freenode.net\n- `django-wiki@googlegroups.com <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-wiki>`__\n- `twitter:djangowiki <https://twitter.com/djangowiki>`__\n\n*THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRE...*\n-----------------------------\n\nCurrently, the model API is subject to smaller changes, and the plugin\nAPI seems pretty stable.\n\nIn order to customize the wiki, best idea is to override templates and create\nyour own template tags. Do not make your own hard copy of this repository in\norder to fiddle with internal parts of the wiki -- this strategy will lead you\nto lose out on future updates with highly improved features and plugins.\nPossibly security updates as well!\n\nThe release cycle has already begun, so you can administer django-wiki\nthrough Pypi and pip.\n\nAll views are class-based, however don\'t take it as an encouragement to\nextend them, unless you are prepared to modify both templates and view\nclasses every time there is an update.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease read our\n`Developer Guide <https://django-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/index.html>`__\n\nManifesto\n---------\n\nDjango needs a mature wiki system appealing to all kinds of needs, both\nbig and small:\n\n-  **Be pluggable and light-weight.** Don\'t integrate optional features\n   in the core.\n-  **Be open.** Make an extension API that allows the ecology of the\n   wiki to grow in a structured way. Wikipedia consists of over `1100\n   extension projects <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/query/all/?after=1100>`__\n   written for MediaWiki. We should learn from this.\n-  **Be smart.** `This\n   is <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/MediaWiki_1.24.1_database_schema.svg>`__\n   the map of tables in MediaWiki - we\'ll understand the choices of\n   other wiki projects and make our own. After-all, this is a Django\n   project.\n-  **Be simple.** The source code should *almost* explain itself.\n-  **Be structured.** Markdown is a simple syntax for readability.\n   Features should be implemented either through easy coding patterns in\n   the content field, but rather stored in a structured way (in the\n   database) and managed through a friendly interface. This gives\n   control back to the website developer, and makes knowledge more\n   usable. Just ask: Why has Wikipedia never changed? Answer: Because\n   it\'s knowledge is stored in a complicated way, thus it becomes very\n   static.\n\nDocs\n----\n\nSee the docs/ folder, or read them at:\n\nhttps://django-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nIf you wish to add something, please ask in the google group or raise an\nissue if you\'re in doubt about whether something might change.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nDjango-wiki is a rewrite of\n`django-simplewiki <https://code.google.com/p/django-simple-wiki/>`__, a\nproject from 2009 that aimed to be a base system for a wiki. It proposed\nthat the user should customize the wiki by overwriting templates, but\nsoon learned that the only customization that really took place was that\npeople forked the entire project. We don\'t want that for django-wiki, we\nwant it to be modular and extendable.\n\nAs of now, Django has existed for too long without a proper wiki\napplication. The dream of django-wiki is to become a contestant\nalongside Mediawiki, so that Django developers can stick to the Django\nplatform even when facing tough challenges such as implementing a wiki.\n\nQ&A\n---\n\n-  **Why is the module named just** ``wiki`` **?** Because when we tried\n   ``pip install wiki``, it returned "No distributions at all found\n   for wiki", so we had to make up for that!\n-  **What markup language will you use?**\n   `Markdown <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown>`__. The markup\n   renderer is not a pluggable part but has been internalized into core\n   parts. Discussion should go here:\n   https://github.com/django-wiki/django-wiki/issues/76\n-  **Why not use django-reversion?** It\'s a great project, but if the\n   wiki has to grow ambitious, someone will have to optimize its\n   behavior, and using a third-party application for something as\n   crucial as the revision system is a no-go in this regard.\n-  **Any support for multiple wikis?** Yes, in an sense you can just\n   imagine that you always have multiple wikis, because you always have\n   hierarchies and full control of their permissions. See this\n   discussion: https://github.com/django-wiki/django-wiki/issues/63\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nPlease refer to current release to see exact version dependencies.
