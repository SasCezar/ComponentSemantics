It brings together mature\nand stable open-source software projects under a consistent and\neasy-to-use interface allowing non-specialized users to share data and\ncreate interactive maps.\n\nData management tools built into GeoNode allow for integrated creation\nof data, metadata, and map visualization. Each dataset in the system can\nbe shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users.\nSocial features like user profiles and commenting and rating systems\nallow for the development of communities around each platform to\nfacilitate the use, management, and quality control of the data the\nGeoNode instance contains.\n\nIt is also designed to be a flexible platform that software developers\ncan extend, modify or integrate against to meet requirements in their\nown applications.\n\nTry out GeoNode\n---------------\n\nIf you just want to try out GeoNode visit our official Demo online at:\nhttp://master.demo.geonode.org. After your registration you will be able\nto test all basic functionalities like uploading layers, creation of\nmaps, editing metadata, styles and much more. To get an overview what\nGeoNode can do we recommend to have a look at the [Users\nWorkshop](http://docs.geonode.org/en/2.10.x/usage/index.html).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n    The latest official release is 2.10!\n\nGeoNode can be setup in different ways, flavors and plattforms. If\nyou\xc2\xb4re planning to do development or install for production please visit\nthe offical GeoNode installation documentation:\n\n- [Docker](http://docs.geonode.org/en/2.10.x/install/core/index.html#docker)\n- [Ubuntu 18.04](http://docs.geonode.org/en/2.10.x/install/core/index.html#ubuntu-18-04)\n\nLearn GeoNode\n-------------\n\nAfter you\xc2\xb4ve finished the setup process make yourself familiar with the\ngeneral usage and settings of your GeoNodes instance. - the [User\nTraining](http://docs.geonode.org/en/2.10.x/usage/index.html)\nis going in depth into what we can do. - the [Administrators\nWorkshop](http://docs.geonode.org/en/2.10.x/admin/index.html)\nwill guide you to the most important parts regarding management commands\nand configuration settings.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nGeoNode is a web based GIS tool, and as such, in order to do development\non GeoNode itself or to integrate it into your own application, you\nshould be familiar with basic web development concepts as well as with\ngeneral GIS concepts.\n\nFor development GeoNode can be run in a \'development environment\'. In\ncontrast to a \'production environment\' development differs as it uses\nlightweight components to speed up things.\n\nTo get you started have a look at the [Install\ninstructions](#install) which cover all what is needed to run GeoNode\nfor development. Further visit the the [Developer\nworkshop](http://docs.geonode.org/en/2.10.x/devel/index.html)\nfor a basic overview.\n\nIf you\'re planning of customizing your GeoNode instance, or to extend\nit\'s functionalities it\'s not advisable to change core files in any\ncase. In this case it\'s common to use setup a [GeoNode Project\nTemplate](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode-project).\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nGeoNode is an open source project and contributors are needed to keep\nthis project moving forward. Learn more on how to contribute on our\n[Community\nBylaws](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/wiki/Community-Bylaws).\n\nRoadmap\n-------\n\nGeoNode\'s development roadmap is documented in a series of GeoNode\nImprovement Projects (GNIPS). They are documented at [GeoNode Wiki](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/wiki/GeoNode-Improvement-Proposals).\n\nGNIPS are considered to be large undertakings which will add a large\namount of features to the project. As such they are the topic of\ncommunity dicussion and guidance. The community discusses these on the\ndeveloper mailing list: http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geonode-devel/\n\nShowcase\n--------\n\nA handful of other Open Source projects extend GeoNode\xe2\x80\x99s functionality\nby tapping into the re-usability of Django applications. Visit our\ngallery to see how the community uses GeoNode: [GeoNode\nShowcase](http://geonode.org/gallery/).\n\nThe development community is very supportive of new projects and\ncontributes ideas and guidance for newcomers.\n\nMost useful links\n-----------------\n\n\n**General**\n\n- Project homepage: https://geonode.org\n- Repository: https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode\n- Offical Demo: http://master.demo.geonode.org\n- GeoNode Wiki: https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/wiki\n- Issue tracker: https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode-project/issues\n\n    In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please\n    contact a GeoNode Core Developer directly instead of using issue\n    tracker.
