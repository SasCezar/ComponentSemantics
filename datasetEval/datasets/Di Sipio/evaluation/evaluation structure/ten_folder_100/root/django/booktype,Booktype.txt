b'Booktype\n--------\n\nBooktype makes it easier and quicker for authors, companies and organisations to edit and publish books. It imports DOCX or EPUB files, converts them into single-source HTML for online editing and proofreading, and uses CSS Paged Media to produce good-looking output for print, the open web, and almost any ebook reader, in seconds. Booktype facilitates collaborative, agile production across time zones and borders.\n\nBooktype is built on the [Django](https://github.com/django/django) web framework and many great [Python libraries](https://github.com/booktype/Booktype/tree/master/requirements).\n\nThe Booktype user interface is being [translated into many languages](https://www.transifex.com/sourcefabric/booktype) by our [community of contributors](https://github.com/booktype/Booktype/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt). Your help with development or translation is always welcome!\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstallation instructions for Booktype on GNU/Linux and OS X can be found in the [Booktype user manual](https://sourcefabric.booktype.pro/booktype-24-for-authors-and-publishers/before-you-install/).\n\nFiles for installation using Docker can be found in the [Booktype-docker](https://github.com/booktype/booktype-docker) repository.\n\n\nMore information\n----------------\n\n- Check the [#booktype](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23booktype) hashtag on Twitter, or follow us [@Booktypo](https://twitter.com/Booktypo)\n- [Booktype issue tracker](https://dev.sourcefabric.org/browse/BK)\n- [Booktype support forum](https://forum.sourcefabric.org/categories/booktype-support)\n- [Booktype development forum](https://forum.sourcefabric.org/categories/booktype-development)\n- [Booktype documentation forum](https://forum.sourcefabric.org/categories/booktype-documentation)\n- [Developer documentation for Booktype](http://booktype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\n1.
