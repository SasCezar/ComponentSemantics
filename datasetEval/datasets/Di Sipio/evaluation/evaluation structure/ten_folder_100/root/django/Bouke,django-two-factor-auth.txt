Built on top of the one-time\npassword framework django-otp_ and Django\'s built-in authentication framework\n``django.contrib.auth`` for providing the easiest integration into most Django\nprojects. Inspired by the user experience of Google\'s Two-Step Authentication,\nallowing users to authenticate through call, text messages (SMS), by using a\ntoken generator app like Google Authenticator or a YubiKey_ hardware token\ngenerator (optional).\n\nI would love to hear your feedback on this package. If you run into\nproblems, please file an issue on GitHub, or contribute to the project by\nforking the repository and sending some pull requests. The package is\ntranslated into English, Dutch and other languages. Please contribute your own\nlanguage using Transifex_.\n\nTest drive this app through the online `example app`_, hosted by Heroku_. It\ndemos most features except the Twilio integration. The example also includes\ndjango-user-sessions_ for providing Django sessions with a foreign key to the\nuser. Although the package is optional, it improves account security control\nover ``django.contrib.sessions``.\n\nCompatible with modern Django versions.
