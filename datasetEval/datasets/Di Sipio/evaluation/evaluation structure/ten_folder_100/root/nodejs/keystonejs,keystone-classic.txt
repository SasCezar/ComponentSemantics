Keystone makes it easy to create sophisticated web sites and apps, and comes with a beautiful auto-generated Admin UI.\n\nCheck out our [demo site](http://demo.keystonejs.com) to see it in action.\n\n### Keystone 5\n\nWe\'ve been working on a new version of Keystone. If you\'re starting a new project you might be interested in trying out [Keystone 5](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/). \n\n### Documentation\n\nFor Keystone v4 documentation and guides, see [keystonejs.com](https://v4.keystonejs.com).\n\nFor Keystone v0.3 documentation, see [v3.keystonejs.com](https://v3.keystonejs.com).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis section provides a short intro to Keystone. Check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://keystonejs.com/getting-started) in the Keystone documentation for a more comprehensive introduction.\n\n### Installation\n\nThe easiest way to get started with Keystone is to use the Yeoman generator:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -g generator-keystone\n$ yo keystone\n```\n\nAnswer the questions, and the generator will create a new project based on the options you select, and install the required packages from **npm**.\n\nAlternatively, to include Keystone in an existing project or start from scratch (without Yeoman), specify `keystone: "4.0.0"` in the `dependencies` array of your `package.json` file, and run `npm install` from your terminal.\n\nThen read through the [Documentation](https://keystonejs.com/documentation) and the [Example Projects](http://v3.keystonejs.com/examples) to understand how to use it.\n\n### Configuration\n\nConfig variables can be passed in an object to the `keystone.init` method, or can be set any time before `keystone.start` is called using `keystone.set(key, value)`. This allows for a more flexible order of execution. For example, if you refer to Lists in your routes you can set the routes after configuring your Lists.\n\nSee the [KeystoneJS configuration documentation](https://keystonejs.com/documentation/configuration) for details and examples of the available options.\n\n### Database field types\n\nKeystone builds on the basic data types provided by MongoDB and allows you to easily add rich, functional fields to your application\'s models.\n\nYou get helper methods on your models for dealing with each field type easily (such as formatting a date or number, resizing an image, getting an array of the available options for a select field, or using Google\'s Places API to improve addresses) as well as a beautiful, responsive admin UI to edit your data with.\n\nSee the [KeystoneJS database documentation](https://keystonejs.com/documentation/database) for details and examples of the various field types, as well as how to set up and use database models in your application.\n\n### Running KeystoneJS in Production\n\nWhen you deploy your KeystoneJS app to production, be sure to set your `ENV` environment variable to `production`.\n\nYou can do this by setting `NODE_ENV=production` in your `.env` file, which gets handled by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).\n\nSetting your environment enables certain features (including template caching, simpler error reporting, and HTML minification) that are important in production but annoying in development.\n\n## Community\n\nWe have a friendly, growing community and welcome everyone to get involved:\n\n- Follow [@KeystoneJS](https://twitter.com/KeystoneJS) on twitter for news and announcements.\n- Ask technical questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/keystone.js) and tag them `keystonejs.`\n- Report bugs and feature suggestions on our GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/issues).\n- Join the [KeystoneJS Slack](https://launchpass.com/keystonejs) for general discussion with the Keystone community and contributors.\n\nWe love to hear feedback about Keystone and the projects you\'re using it for. Ping us at [@KeystoneJS](https://twitter.com/KeystoneJS) on Twitter.\n\n### Contributing\n\nIf you can, please contribute by reporting issues, discussing ideas, helping answer questions from other developers, or submitting pull requests with patches and new features. We do our best to respond to all issues and pull requests, and make patch releases to npm regularly.\n\nIf you\'re going to contribute code, please follow our [coding standards](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/wiki/Coding-Standards) and read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Related Projects\n\nIf you are using KeystoneJS in any projects we encourage you to add to our [Related Projects Page](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/wiki/Related-Projects).
