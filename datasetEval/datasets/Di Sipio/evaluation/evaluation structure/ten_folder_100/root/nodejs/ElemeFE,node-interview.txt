And, this repo is the interview catalog (not just questions & answers) about it, and it shows you how to pass the Node.js interview of [ElemeFE](https://github.com/ElemeFE/).\n\n* ## Motivation\n\nWe had a lot of interviews about Node.js & full-stack in 2016. We found there are many developers came from frontend, and most of them had leaky knowledge of backend system. Thus we found it\'s difficult to got senior Node.js developer about backend (not full-stack).\n\nDue to our consistent of open source and sharing spirit, we prepared this Node.js advanced tutorial which called "node-interview".\n\n* ## Start Reading\n  * [English Entry](sections/en-us/)\n  * [\xe7\xae\x80\xe4\xbd\x93\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87\xe5\x85\xa5\xe5\x8f\xa3](sections/zh-cn/)\n\n> The content is translated from chinese, We\'d say sorry that the translation is just started, you may not able to read it completely.
