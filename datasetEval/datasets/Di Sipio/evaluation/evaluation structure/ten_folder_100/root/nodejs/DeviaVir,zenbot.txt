It features:\n\n- Fully-automated [technical-analysis](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators)-based trading approach\n- Full support for [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/), [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/), [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/), [CEX.IO](https://cex.io/), [GDAX](https://gdax.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.com/), [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/), [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/), [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/), [QuadrigaCX](https://www.quadrigacx.com/) and [TheRockTrading](https://www.therocktrading.com/), work on further exchange support is ongoing.\n- Plugin architecture for implementing exchange support, or writing new strategies\n- Simulator for [backtesting strategies](https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/b09a734cf626ffb9bb3bcb1ca35f3db4) against historical data\n- "Paper" trading mode, operates on a simulated balance while watching the live market\n- Configurable sell stops, buy stops, and (trailing) profit stops\n- Flexible sampling period and trade frequency - averages 1-2 trades/day with 1h period, 15-50/day with 5m period\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n- Zenbot is NOT a sure-fire profit machine. Use it AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n- Crypto-currency is still an experiment, and therefore so is Zenbot. Meaning, both may fail at any time.\n- Running a bot, and trading in general requires careful study of the risks and parameters involved. A wrong setting can cause you a major loss.\n- Never leave the bot un-monitored for long periods of time. Zenbot doesn\'t know when to stop, so be prepared to stop it if too much loss occurs.\n- Often times the default trade parameters will underperform vs. a buy-hold strategy, so run some simulations and find the optimal parameters for your chosen exchange/pair before going "all-in".\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe extensive documentation is located at the [docs-folder](docs/).\n\n### Questions\n\nFirst have a look at the [docs](docs/) and there are also [FAQs](docs/FAQ.md) which may answer your questions.\nIf not, please ask (programming) questions related to Zenbot on Reddit ([subreddit zenbot](https://reddit.com/r/zenbot)).\n\n### Community\n\nJoin the [Zenbot community on Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/zenbot)!\n\n## Donate\n\nP.S., some have asked for how to donate to Zenbot development.
