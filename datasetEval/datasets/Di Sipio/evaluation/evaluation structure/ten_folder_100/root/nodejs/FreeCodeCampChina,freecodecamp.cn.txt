Front End Certification\nThe first section will teach you the basics of how webpages work and also introduce you to JavaScript programming.\n\nSkills you\'ll practice include `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `jQuery` and `Bootstrap`.\n\nTo earn this certification, you\'ll build **10 front-end projects** and implement many **JavaScript algorithms**.\n\n##### 2. Data Visualization Certification\nThe second section builds upon the first and introduces you to more advanced topics such as `Sass`, `React` and `D3`.\n\nTo earn this certification, you\'ll build **5 React-apps** and **5 Data visualization apps** using `D3.js`.\n\n##### 3. Back End Certification\nThe third section introduces you to back end development using `Node.js`, `Express,` and `MongoDB`. It also teaches you about the important concept of source control using `Git`.\n\nTo earn this certification, you\'ll build **5 APIs** and **5 full stack apps**.\n\nWe will accept solutions implemented in _any_ programming language, as long as both a live demo and the source code are publicly accessible.\n\n##### 4. Full Stack Certification\nThe fourth section is where you\'ll get **real-world experience** by working on projects for **nonprofits**.\nWe\'ll pair you with another camper, an agile project manager, and a stakeholder from a nonprofit organization. Together, you\'ll plan, build and maintain apps that help that nonprofit carry out its mission more effectively.\n\nFor this certification, you\'ll work on **two projects from scratch** and then **maintain/upgrade two existing projects**.\n\n---\n\nThis code is running live at [freeCodeCamp.cn](https://freecodecamp.cn).
