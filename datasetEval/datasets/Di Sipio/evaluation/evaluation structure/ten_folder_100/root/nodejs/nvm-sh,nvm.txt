To do that, you may either download and run the script manually, or use the following cURL or Wget command:\n```sh\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash\n```\n```sh\nwget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash\n```\n\nRunning either of the above commands downloads a script and runs it. The script clones the nvm repository to `~/.nvm`, and adds the source lines from the snippet below to your profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`).\n\n<a id="profile_snippet"></a>\n```sh\nexport NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"\n[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \\. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm\n```\n\n<sub>**Note:** If the environment variable `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is present, it will place the `nvm` files there.</sub>\n\n**Note:** You can add `--no-use` to the end of the above script (...`nvm.sh --no-use`) to postpone using `nvm` until you manually [`use`](#usage) it.\n\nYou can customize the install source, directory, profile, and version using the `NVM_SOURCE`, `NVM_DIR`, `PROFILE`, and `NODE_VERSION` variables.\nEg: `curl ... | NVM_DIR="path/to/nvm"`. Ensure that the `NVM_DIR` does not contain a trailing slash.\n\n<sub>*NB. The installer can use `git`, `curl`, or `wget` to download `nvm`, whatever is available.*</sub>\n\n**Note:** On Linux, after running the install script, if you get `nvm: command not found` or see no feedback from your terminal after you type `command -v nvm`, simply close your current terminal, open a new terminal, and try verifying again.\n\n**Note:** Since OS X 10.9, `/usr/bin/git` has been preset by Xcode command line tools, which means we can\'t properly detect if Git is installed or not. You need to manually install the Xcode command line tools before running the install script, otherwise, it\'ll fail. (see [#1782](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/1782))\n\n**Note:** On OS X, if you get `nvm: command not found` after running the install script, one of the following might be the reason:\n\n  - Your system may not have a `.bash_profile` file where the command is set up. Create one with `touch ~/.bash_profile` and run the install script again\n  - You might need to restart your terminal instance. Try opening a new tab/window in your terminal and retry.\n\nIf the above doesn\'t fix the problem, you may try the following:\n  - Open your `.bash_profile` (or `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`) and add the following line of code: `source ~/<your_profile_file>`. E.g. `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`.\n  - If the above don\'t work, try adding the [snippet from the install section](#profile_snippet) that finds the correct nvm directory and loads nvm, to your profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`).\n\n- For more information about this issue and possible workarounds, please [refer here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/576)\n\n#### Ansible\n  You can use a task:\n\n```\n- name: nvm\n  shell: >\n    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash\n  args:\n    creates: "{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/.nvm/nvm.sh"\n```\n\n### Verify installation\n\nTo verify that nvm has been installed, do:\n\n```sh\ncommand -v nvm\n```\n\nwhich should output `nvm` if the installation was successful. Please note that `which nvm` will not work, since `nvm` is a sourced shell function, not an executable binary.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nIf you\'re running a system without prepackaged binary available, which means you\'re going to install nodejs or io.js from its source code, you need to make sure your system has a C++ compiler. For OS X, Xcode will work, for Debian/Ubuntu based GNU/Linux, the `build-essential` and `libssl-dev` packages work.\n\n**Note:** `nvm` does not support Windows (see [#284](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/284)), but may work in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) depending on the version of WSL. For Windows, two alternatives exist, which are neither supported nor developed by us:\n\n  - [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)\n  - [nodist](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist)\n\n**Note:** `nvm` does not support [Fish] either (see [#303](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/303)). Alternatives exist, which are neither supported nor developed by us:\n\n  - [bass](https://github.com/edc/bass) allows you to use utilities written for Bash in fish shell\n  - [fast-nvm-fish](https://github.com/brigand/fast-nvm-fish) only works with version numbers (not aliases) but doesn\'t significantly slow your shell startup\n  - [plugin-nvm](https://github.com/derekstavis/plugin-nvm) plugin for [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish), which makes nvm and its completions available in fish shell\n  - [fnm](https://github.com/fisherman/fnm) - [fisherman](https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman)-based version manager for fish\n  - [fish-nvm](https://github.com/FabioAntunes/fish-nvm) - Wrapper around nvm for fish, delays sourcing nvm until it\'s actually used.\n\n**Note:** We still have some problems with FreeBSD, because there is no official pre-built binary for FreeBSD, and building from source may need [patches](https://www.freshports.org/www/node/files/patch-deps_v8_src_base_platform_platform-posix.cc); see the issue ticket:\n\n  - [[#900] [Bug] nodejs on FreeBSD may need to be patched](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/900)\n  - [nodejs/node#3716](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/3716)\n\n**Note:** On OS X, if you do not have Xcode installed and you do not wish to download the ~4.3GB file, you can install the `Command Line Tools`. You can check out this blog post on how to just that:\n\n  - [How to Install Command Line Tools in OS X Mavericks & Yosemite (Without Xcode)](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/)\n\n**Note:** On OS X, if you have/had a "system" node installed and want to install modules globally, keep in mind that:\n\n  - When using `nvm` you do not need `sudo` to globally install a module with `npm -g`, so instead of doing `sudo npm install -g grunt`, do instead `npm install -g grunt`\n  - If you have an `~/.npmrc` file, make sure it does not contain any `prefix` settings (which is not compatible with `nvm`)\n  - You can (but should not?) keep your previous "system" node install, but `nvm` will only be available to your user account (the one used to install nvm). This might cause version mismatches, as other users will be using `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/*` VS your user account using `~/.nvm/versions/node/vX.X.X/lib/node_modules/*`\n\nHomebrew installation is not supported. If you have issues with homebrew-installed `nvm`, please `brew uninstall` it, and install it using the instructions below, before filing an issue.\n\n**Note:** If you\'re using `zsh` you can easily install `nvm` as a zsh plugin. Install [`zsh-nvm`](https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm) and run `nvm upgrade` to upgrade.\n\n**Note:** Git versions before v1.7 may face a problem of cloning `nvm` source from GitHub via https protocol, and there is also different behavior of git before v1.6, and git prior to [v1.17.10](https://github.com/git/git/commit/5a7d5b683f869d3e3884a89775241afa515da9e7) can not clone tags, so the minimum required git version is v1.7.10. If you are interested in the problem we mentioned here, please refer to GitHub\'s [HTTPS cloning errors](https://help.github.com/articles/https-cloning-errors/) article.\n\n### Git install\n\nIf you have `git` installed (requires git v1.7.10+):\n\n1. clone this repo in the root of your user profile\n  - `cd ~/` from anywhere then `git clone https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git .nvm`\n1. `cd ~/.nvm` and check out the latest version with `git checkout v0.35.1`\n1. activate `nvm` by sourcing it from your shell: `. nvm.sh`\n\nNow add these lines to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.zshrc` file to have it automatically sourced upon login:\n(you may have to add to more than one of the above files)\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"\n[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \\. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm\n[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \\. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion\n```\n\n### Manual Install\n\nFor a fully manual install, execute the following lines to first clone the `nvm` repository into `$HOME/.nvm`, and then load `nvm`:\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && (\n  git clone https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git "$NVM_DIR"\n  cd "$NVM_DIR"\n  git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags --match "v[0-9]*" $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1)`\n) && \\. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"\n```\n\nNow add these lines to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.zshrc` file to have it automatically sourced upon login:\n(you may have to add to more than one of the above files)\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"\n[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \\. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm\n```\n\n### Manual upgrade\n\nFor manual upgrade with `git` (requires git v1.7.10+):\n\n1. change to the `$NVM_DIR`\n1. pull down the latest changes\n1. check out the latest version\n1. activate the new version\n\n```sh\n(\n  cd "$NVM_DIR"\n  git fetch --tags origin\n  git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags --match "v[0-9]*" $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1)`\n) && \\. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo download, compile, and install the latest release of node, do this:\n\n```sh\nnvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version\n```\n\nTo install a specific version of node:\n\n```sh\nnvm install 6.14.4 # or 10.10.0, 8.9.1, etc\n```\n\nThe first version installed becomes the default. New shells will start with the default version of node (e.g., `nvm alias default`).\n\nYou can list available versions using `ls-remote`:\n\n```sh\nnvm ls-remote\n```\n\nAnd then in any new shell just use the installed version:\n\n```sh\nnvm use node\n```\n\nOr you can just run it:\n\n```sh\nnvm run node --version\n```\n\nOr, you can run any arbitrary command in a subshell with the desired version of node:\n\n```sh\nnvm exec 4.2 node --version\n```\n\nYou can also get the path to the executable to where it was installed:\n\n```sh\nnvm which 5.0\n```\n\nIn place of a version pointer like "0.10" or "5.0" or "4.2.1", you can use the following special default aliases with `nvm install`, `nvm use`, `nvm run`, `nvm exec`, `nvm which`, etc:\n\n  - `node`: this installs the latest version of [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n  - `iojs`: this installs the latest version of [`io.js`](https://iojs.org/en/)\n  - `stable`: this alias is deprecated, and only truly applies to `node` `v0.12` and earlier. Currently, this is an alias for `node`.\n  - `unstable`: this alias points to `node` `v0.11` - the last "unstable" node release, since post-1.0, all node versions are stable. (in SemVer, versions communicate breakage, not stability).\n\n### Long-term support\n\nNode has a [schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) for long-term support (LTS) You can reference LTS versions in aliases and `.nvmrc` files with the notation `lts/*` for the latest LTS, and `lts/argon` for LTS releases from the "argon" line, for example. In addition, the following commands support LTS arguments:\n\n  - `nvm install --lts` / `nvm install --lts=argon` / `nvm install \'lts/*\'` / `nvm install lts/argon`\n  - `nvm uninstall --lts` / `nvm uninstall --lts=argon` / `nvm uninstall \'lts/*\'` / `nvm uninstall lts/argon`\n  - `nvm use --lts` / `nvm use --lts=argon` / `nvm use \'lts/*\'` / `nvm use lts/argon`\n  - `nvm exec --lts` / `nvm exec --lts=argon` / `nvm exec \'lts/*\'` / `nvm exec lts/argon`\n  - `nvm run --lts` / `nvm run --lts=argon` / `nvm run \'lts/*\'` / `nvm run lts/argon`\n  - `nvm ls-remote --lts` / `nvm ls-remote --lts=argon` `nvm ls-remote \'lts/*\'` / `nvm ls-remote lts/argon`\n  - `nvm version-remote --lts` / `nvm version-remote --lts=argon` / `nvm version-remote \'lts/*\'` / `nvm version-remote lts/argon`\n\nAny time your local copy of `nvm` connects to https://nodejs.org, it will re-create the appropriate local aliases for all available LTS lines. These aliases (stored under `$NVM_DIR/alias/lts`), are managed by `nvm`, and you should not modify, remove, or create these files - expect your changes to be undone, and expect meddling with these files to cause bugs that will likely not be supported.\n\n### Migrating global packages while installing\n\nIf you want to install a new version of Node.js and migrate npm packages from a previous version:\n\n```sh\nnvm install node --reinstall-packages-from=node\n```\n\nThis will first use "nvm version node" to identify the current version you\'re migrating packages from. Then it resolves the new version to install from the remote server and installs it. Lastly, it runs "nvm reinstall-packages" to reinstall the npm packages from your prior version of Node to the new one.\n\nYou can also install and migrate npm packages from specific versions of Node like this:\n\n```sh\nnvm install 6 --reinstall-packages-from=5\nnvm install v4.2 --reinstall-packages-from=iojs\n```\n\nNote that reinstalling packages _explicitly does not update the npm version_ \xe2\x80\x94 this is to ensure that npm isn\'t accidentally upgraded to a broken version for the new node version.\n\nTo update npm at the same time add the `--latest-npm` flag, like this:\n\n```sh\nnvm install lts/* --reinstall-packages-from=default --latest-npm\n```\n\nor, you can at any time run the following command to get the latest supported npm version on the current node version:\n```sh\nnvm install-latest-npm\n```\n\nIf you\'ve already gotten an error to the effect of "npm does not support Node.js", you\'ll need to (1) revert to a previous node version (`nvm ls` & `nvm use <your latest _working_ version from the ls>`, (2) delete the newly created node version (`nvm uninstall <your _broken_ version of node from the ls>`), then (3) rerun your `nvm install` with the `--latest-npm` flag.\n\n\n### Default global packages from file while installing\n\nIf you have a list of default packages you want installed every time you install a new version, we support that too -- just add the package names, one per line, to the file `$NVM_DIR/default-packages`. You can add anything npm would accept as a package argument on the command line.\n\n```sh\n# $NVM_DIR/default-packages\n\nrimraf\nobject-inspect@1.0.2\nstevemao/left-pad\n```\n\n### io.js\n\nIf you want to install [io.js](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/):\n\n```sh\nnvm install iojs\n```\n\nIf you want to install a new version of io.js and migrate npm packages from a previous version:\n\n```sh\nnvm install iojs --reinstall-packages-from=iojs\n```\n\nThe same guidelines mentioned for migrating npm packages in node are applicable to io.js.\n\n### System version of node\n\nIf you want to use the system-installed version of node, you can use the special default alias "system":\n\n```sh\nnvm use system\nnvm run system --version\n```\n\n### Listing versions\n\nIf you want to see what versions are installed:\n\n```sh\nnvm ls\n```\n\nIf you want to see what versions are available to install:\n\n```sh\nnvm ls-remote\n```\n\n#### Suppressing colorized output\n\n`nvm ls`, `nvm ls-remote` and `nvm alias` usually produce colorized output. You can disable colors with the `--no-colors` option (or by setting the environment variable `TERM=dumb`):\n\n```sh\nnvm ls --no-colors\nTERM=dumb nvm ls\n```\n\nTo restore your PATH, you can deactivate it:\n\n```sh\nnvm deactivate\n```\n\nTo set a default Node version to be used in any new shell, use the alias \'default\':\n\n```sh\nnvm alias default node\n```\n\nTo use a mirror of the node binaries, set `$NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR`:\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://nodejs.org/dist\nnvm install node\n\nNVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://nodejs.org/dist nvm install 4.2\n```\n\nTo use a mirror of the io.js binaries, set `$NVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR`:\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://iojs.org/dist\nnvm install iojs-v1.0.3\n\nNVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://iojs.org/dist nvm install iojs-v1.0.3\n```\n\n`nvm use` will not, by default, create a "current" symlink. Set `$NVM_SYMLINK_CURRENT` to "true" to enable this behavior, which is sometimes useful for IDEs. Note that using `nvm` in multiple shell tabs with this environment variable enabled can cause race conditions.\n\n### .nvmrc\n\nYou can create a `.nvmrc` file containing a node version number (or any other string that `nvm` understands; see `nvm --help` for details) in the project root directory (or any parent directory).\nAfterwards, `nvm use`, `nvm install`, `nvm exec`, `nvm run`, and `nvm which` will use the version specified in the `.nvmrc` file if no version is supplied on the command line.\n\nFor example, to make nvm default to the latest 5.9 release, the latest LTS version, or the latest node version for the current directory:\n\n```sh\n$ echo "5.9" > .nvmrc\n\n$ echo "lts/*" > .nvmrc # to default to the latest LTS version\n\n$ echo "node" > .nvmrc # to default to the latest version\n```\n\nThen when you run nvm:\n\n```sh\n$ nvm use\nFound \'/path/to/project/.nvmrc\' with version <5.9>\nNow using node v5.9.1 (npm v3.7.3)\n```\n\n`nvm use` et. al. will traverse directory structure upwards from the current directory looking for the `.nvmrc` file. In other words, running `nvm use` et. al. in any subdirectory of a directory with an `.nvmrc` will result in that `.nvmrc` being utilized.\n\nThe contents of a `.nvmrc` file **must** be the `<version>` (as described by `nvm --help`) followed by a newline. No trailing spaces are allowed, and the trailing newline is required.\n\n### Deeper Shell Integration\n\nYou can use [`avn`](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn) to deeply integrate into your shell and automatically invoke `nvm` when changing directories. `avn` is **not** supported by the `nvm` development team. Please [report issues to the `avn` team](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn/issues/new).\n\nIf you prefer a lighter-weight solution, the recipes below have been contributed by `nvm` users. They are **not** supported by the `nvm` development team. We are, however, accepting pull requests for more examples.\n\n#### bash\n\n##### Automatically call `nvm use`\n\nPut the following at the end of your `$HOME/.bashrc`:\n\n```bash\nfind-up () {\n    path=$(pwd)\n    while [[ "$path" != "" && ! -e "$path/$1" ]]; do\n        path=${path%/*}\n    done\n    echo "$path"\n}\n\ncdnvm(){\n    cd "$@";\n    nvm_path=$(find-up .nvmrc | tr -d \'[:space:]\')\n\n    # If there are no .nvmrc file, use the default nvm version\n    if [[ ! $nvm_path = *[^[:space:]]* ]]; then\n\n        declare default_version;\n        default_version=$(nvm version default);\n\n        # If there is no default version, set it to `node`\n        # This will use the latest version on your machine\n        if [[ $default_version == "N/A" ]]; then\n            nvm alias default node;\n            default_version=$(nvm version default);\n        fi\n\n        # If the current version is not the default version, set it to use the default version\n        if [[ $(nvm current) != "$default_version" ]]; then\n            nvm use default;\n        fi\n\n        elif [[ -s $nvm_path/.nvmrc && -r $nvm_path/.nvmrc ]]; then\n        declare nvm_version\n        nvm_version=$(<"$nvm_path"/.nvmrc)\n\n        declare locally_resolved_nvm_version\n        # `nvm ls` will check all locally-available versions\n        # If there are multiple matching versions, take the latest one\n        # Remove the `->` and `*` characters and spaces\n        # `locally_resolved_nvm_version` will be `N/A` if no local versions are found\n        locally_resolved_nvm_version=$(nvm ls --no-colors "$nvm_version" | tail -1 | tr -d \'\\->*\' | tr -d \'[:space:]\')\n\n        # If it is not already installed, install it\n        # `nvm install` will implicitly use the newly-installed version\n        if [[ "$locally_resolved_nvm_version" == "N/A" ]]; then\n            nvm install "$nvm_version";\n        elif [[ $(nvm current) != "$locally_resolved_nvm_version" ]]; then\n            nvm use "$nvm_version";\n        fi\n    fi\n}\nalias cd=\'cdnvm\'\n```\n\nThis alias would search \'up\' from your current directory in order to detect a `.nvmrc` file. If it finds it, it will switch to that version; if not, it will use the default version.\n\n#### zsh\n\n##### Calling `nvm use` automatically in a directory with a `.nvmrc` file\n\nPut this into your `$HOME/.zshrc` to call `nvm use` automatically whenever you enter a directory that contains an\n`.nvmrc` file with a string telling nvm which node to `use`:\n\n```zsh\n# place this after nvm initialization!\nautoload -U add-zsh-hook\nload-nvmrc() {\n  local node_version="$(nvm version)"\n  local nvmrc_path="$(nvm_find_nvmrc)"\n\n  if [ -n "$nvmrc_path" ]; then\n    local nvmrc_node_version=$(nvm version "$(cat "${nvmrc_path}")")\n\n    if [ "$nvmrc_node_version" = "N/A" ]; then\n      nvm install\n    elif [ "$nvmrc_node_version" != "$node_version" ]; then\n      nvm use\n    fi\n  elif [ "$node_version" != "$(nvm version default)" ]; then\n    echo "Reverting to nvm default version"\n    nvm use default\n  fi\n}\nadd-zsh-hook chpwd load-nvmrc\nload-nvmrc\n```\n\n## License\n\nnvm is released under the MIT license.\n\n\nCopyright (C) 2010 Tim Caswell and Jordan Harband\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Install Urchin (and other dependencies) like so:\n\n    npm install\n\nThere are slow tests and fast tests. The slow tests do things like install node\nand check that the right versions are used. The fast tests fake this to test\nthings like aliases and uninstalling. From the root of the nvm git repository,\nrun the fast tests like this:\n\n    npm run test/fast\n\nRun the slow tests like this:\n\n    npm run test/slow\n\nRun all of the tests like this:\n\n    npm test\n\nNota bene: Avoid running nvm while the tests are running.\n\n## Bash completion\n\nTo activate, you need to source `bash_completion`:\n\n```sh\n[[ -r $NVM_DIR/bash_completion ]] && \\. $NVM_DIR/bash_completion\n```\n\nPut the above sourcing line just below the sourcing line for nvm in your profile (`.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`).\n\n### Usage\n\nnvm:\n> $ nvm <kbd>Tab</kbd>\n\n```\nalias               deactivate          install             ls                  run                 unload\nclear-cache         exec                list                ls-remote           unalias             use\ncurrent             help                list-remote         reinstall-packages  uninstall           version\n```\n\nnvm alias:\n> $ nvm alias <kbd>Tab</kbd>\n\n```\ndefault\n```\n\n> $ nvm alias my_alias <kbd>Tab</kbd>\n\n```\nv0.6.21        v0.8.26       v0.10.28\n```\n\nnvm use:\n> $ nvm use <kbd>Tab</kbd>\n\n```\nmy_alias        default        v0.6.21        v0.8.26       v0.10.28\n```\n\nnvm uninstall:\n> $ nvm uninstall <kbd>Tab</kbd>\n\n```\nmy_alias        default        v0.6.21        v0.8.26       v0.10.28\n```\n\n## Compatibility Issues\n\n`nvm` will encounter some issues if you have some non-default settings set. (see [#606](/../../issues/606))\nThe following are known to cause issues:\n\nInside `~/.npmrc`:\n\n```sh\nprefix=\'some/path\'\n```\n\nEnvironment Variables:\n\n```sh\n$NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX\n$PREFIX\n```\n\nShell settings:\n\n```sh\nset -e\n```\n\n## Installing nvm on Alpine Linux\n\nIn order to provide the best performance (and other optimisations), nvm will download and install pre-compiled binaries for Node (and npm) when you run `nvm install X`. The Node project compiles, tests and hosts/provides these pre-compiled binaries which are built for mainstream/traditional Linux distributions (such as Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat et al).\n\nAlpine Linux, unlike mainstream/traditional Linux distributions, is based on [BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/), a very compact (~5MB) Linux distribution. BusyBox (and thus Alpine Linux) uses a different C/C++ stack to most mainstream/traditional Linux distributions - [musl](https://www.musl-libc.org/). This makes binary programs built for such mainstream/traditional incompatible with Alpine Linux, thus we cannot simply `nvm install X` on Alpine Linux and expect the downloaded binary to run correctly - you\'ll likely see "...does not exist" errors if you try that.\n\nThere is a `-s` flag for `nvm install` which requests nvm download Node source and compile it locally.\n\nIf installing nvm on Alpine Linux *is* still what you want or need to do, you should be able to achieve this by running the following from you Alpine Linux shell:\n\n```sh\napk add -U curl bash ca-certificates openssl ncurses coreutils python2 make gcc g++ libgcc linux-headers grep util-linux binutils findutils\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash\n```\n\nThe Node project has some desire but no concrete plans (due to the overheads of building, testing and support) to offer Alpine-compatible binaries.\n\nAs a potential alternative, @mhart (a Node contributor) has some [Docker images for Alpine Linux with Node and optionally, npm, pre-installed](https://github.com/mhart/alpine-node).\n\n## Removal\n\n### Manual Uninstall\n\nTo remove `nvm` manually, execute the following:\n\n```sh\n$ rm -rf "$NVM_DIR"\n```\n\nEdit `~/.bashrc` (or other shell resource config) and remove the lines below:\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"\n[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \\. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm\n[[ -r $NVM_DIR/bash_completion ]] && \\. $NVM_DIR/bash_completion\n```\n\n## Docker for development environment\n\nTo make the development and testing work easier, we have a Dockerfile for development usage, which is based on Ubuntu 14.04 base image, prepared with essential and useful tools for `nvm` development, to build the docker image of the environment, run the docker command at the root of `nvm` repository:\n\n```sh\n$ docker build -t nvm-dev .\n```\n\nThis will package your current nvm repository with our pre-defined development environment into a docker image named `nvm-dev`, once it\'s built with success, validate your image via `docker images`:\n\n```sh\n$ docker images\n\nREPOSITORY         TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\nnvm-dev            latest              9ca4c57a97d8        7 days ago          650 MB\n```\n\nIf you got no error message, now you can easily involve in:\n\n```sh\n$ docker run -h nvm-dev -it nvm-dev\n\nnvm@nvm-dev:~/.nvm$\n```\n\nPlease note that it\'ll take about 8 minutes to build the image and the image size would be about 650MB, so it\'s not suitable for production usage.\n\nFor more information and documentation about docker, please refer to its official website:\n\n  - https://www.docker.com/\n  - https://docs.docker.com/\n\n## Problems\n\n  - If you try to install a node version and the installation fails, be sure to run `nvm cache clear` to delete cached node downloads, or you might get an error like the following:\n\n    curl: (33) HTTP server doesn\'t seem to support byte ranges. Cannot resume.\n\n  - Where\'s my `sudo node`? Check out [#43](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/43)\n\n  - After the v0.8.6 release of node, nvm tries to install from binary packages. But in some systems, the official binary packages don\'t work due to incompatibility of shared libs. In such cases, use `-s` option to force install from source:\n\n```sh\nnvm install -s 0.8.6\n```\n\n  - If setting the `default` alias does not establish the node version in new shells (i.e. `nvm current` yields `system`), ensure that the system\'s node `PATH` is set before the `nvm.sh` source line in your shell profile (see [#658](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/658))\n\n## Mac OS "troubleshooting"\n\n**nvm node version not found in vim shell**\n\nIf you set node version to a version other than your system node version `nvm use 6.2.1` and open vim and run `:!node -v` you should see `v6.2.1` if you see your system version `v0.12.7`. You need to run:\n\n```shell\nsudo chmod ugo-x /usr/libexec/path_helper\n```\n\nMore on this issue in [dotphiles/dotzsh](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh#mac-os-x).\n\n[1]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git\n[2]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/v0.35.1/install.sh\n[3]: https://travis-ci.org/nvm-sh/nvm\n[4]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/releases/tag/v0.35.1\n[Urchin]: https://github.com/scraperwiki/urchin\n[Fish]: http://fishshell.com\n'
