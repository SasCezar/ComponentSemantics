The new version is under heavy development and we are expecting GA builds in June. The following list summarizes important changes in the new version:\n\n  * Pencil V3 uses Electron instead of Mozilla XULRunner as the runtime. We expect that by moving into this Nodejs-based environment, the Pencil source code can be much easier for all fellow developers to play with. The fact that Mozilla XULRunner is outdated is also a reason for the movement.\n  * A new, zip-based file format was introduced to support large documents and better embedding of external bitmaps/resources.\n  * A new mechanism for page management that dramatically reduces memory usage for large documents.\n  * Document pages can now be structured into a tree-like model.\n  * Custom fonts can now be embedded into Pencil .epz documents\n  * Printing and PDF export will be improved to support all platforms and with many options\n  * New UI approach\n\n\nSetting up\n==========\n\nPencil uses [Atom Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) as the runtime, follow the these steps to setup the environment:\n\n  * Clone this repository\n  * Make sure you are using *nodejs 5+* (Pencil development only needs *npm* for package management. Node runtime is _not_ required.)\n  * Checkout this _development_ branch:\n  \n    ```bash\n    $ git checkout development\n    ```\n    \n  * Install dependencies:\n\n      ```bash\n      $ npm install\n      ```\n      \n  * Start Pencil using the prebuilt version of Electron\n\n    ```bash\n      $ npm start\n    ```\n\n\nSupported Platforms\n==================\n\nOS X\n----\n\nOnly OSX 64bit 10.9 and later are supported.\n\nWindows\n------\n\nWindows 7 and later are supported, older operating systems are not supported (and do not work).\n\nLinux\n-----\n\n* Tested\n    * Ubuntu 12.04 and later\n    * Fedora 21+\n    * Debian 8+\n* Packages\n    * **Arch Linux** - [pencil](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pencil/) on the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/).\n'
