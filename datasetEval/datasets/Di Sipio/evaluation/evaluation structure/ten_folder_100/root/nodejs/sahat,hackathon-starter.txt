A while later, you might have an initial project up on GitHub and only then\ncan other team members start contributing. Or how about doing something as simple as *Sign in with Facebook*\nauthentication? You can spend hours on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works.\n\nWhen I started this project, my primary focus was on **simplicity** and **ease of use**.\nI also tried to make it as **generic** and **reusable** as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps,\nwithout being too specific. In the worst case, you can use this as a learning guide for your projects,\nif for example you are only interested in **Sign in with Google** authentication and nothing else.\n\n### Testimonials\n\n> [**\xe2\x80\x9cNice!

Alternatively,\nhere is another great tutorial for complete beginners - [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:\n\n```bash\n# Get the latest snapshot\ngit clone https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter.git myproject\n\n# Change directory\ncd myproject\n\n# Install NPM dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Then simply start your app\nnode app.js\n```\n\n**Warning:** If you want to use some API that need https to work (for example Pinterest or facebook),\nyou will need to download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).\nYou must start ngrok after starting the project.\n\n```bash\n# start ngrok to intercept the data exchanged on port 8080\n./ngrok http 8080\n```\n\nNext, you must use the https URL defined by ngrok, for example, `https://hackaton.ngrok.io`\n\n**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).\nIt watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the\nserver. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will\nsave you a lot of time in the long run, because you won\'t need to manually\nrestart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run\n`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.\n\nObtaining API Keys\n------------------\n\nTo use any of the included APIs or OAuth authentication methods, you will need\nto obtain appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or\nUsername & Password. You will need to go through each provider to generate new\ncredentials.\n\n<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Google_2015_logo.svg/1000px-Google_2015_logo.svg.png" width="200">\n\n- Visit <a href="https://cloud.google.com/console/project" target="_blank">Google Cloud Console</a>\n- Click on the **Create Project** button\n- Enter *Project Name*, then click on **Create** button\n- Then click on *APIs & auth* in the sidebar and select *API* tab\n- Click on **Google+ API** under *Social APIs*, then click **Enable API**\n- Click on **Google Drive API** under *G Suite*, then click **Enable API**\n- Click on **Google Sheets API** under *G Suite*, then click **Enable API**\n- Next, under *APIs & auth* in the sidebar click on *Credentials* tab\n- Click on **Create new Client ID** button\n- Select *Web Application* and click on **Configure Consent Screen**\n- Fill out the required fields then click on **Save**\n- In the *Create Client ID* modal dialog:\n - **Application Type**: Web Application\n - **Authorized Javascript origins**: http://localhost:8080\n - **Authorized redirect URI**: http://localhost:8080/auth/google/callback\n- Click on **Create Client ID** button\n- Copy and paste *Client ID* and *Client secret* keys into `.env`\n\n**Note:** When you ready to deploy to production don\'t forget to\nadd your new URL to *Authorized Javascript origins* and *Authorized redirect URI*,\ne.g. `http://my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com` and\n`http://my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com/auth/google/callback` respectively.\nThe same goes for other providers.\n\n<hr>\n\n<img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/S/snapchat-logo-F20CDB1199-seeklogo.com.png" height="90">\n\n- Visit <a href="https://kit.snapchat.com/portal" target="_blank">Snap Kit Developer Portal</a>\n- Click on the **+** button to create an app\n- Enter a name for your app\n- Enable the scopes that you will want to use in your app\n- Click on the **Continue** button\n- Find the **Kits** section and make sure that **Login Kit** is enabled\n- Find the **Redirect URLs** section, click the **+ Add** button, and enter `http://localhost:8080/auth/snapchat/callback`\n- Find the **Development Environment** section.

Tips\n--------\n\n- Use [async.parallel()](https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel) when you need to run multiple\nasynchronous tasks, and then render a page, but only when all tasks are completed. For example, you might want to scrape three different websites for some data and render the results in a template after all three websites have been scraped.\n- Need to find a specific object inside an Array? Use [_.find](http://lodash.com/docs#find)\nfunction from Lodash. For example, this is how you would retrieve a\nTwitter token from database: `var token = _.find(req.user.tokens, { kind: \'twitter\' });`,\nwhere 1st parameter is an array, and a 2nd parameter is an object to search for.\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### Why do I get `403 Error: Forbidden` when submitting a form?\nYou need to add the following hidden input element to your form. This has been\nadded in the [pull request #40](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/pull/40)\nas part of the CSRF protection.\n\n```\ninput(type=\'hidden\', name=\'_csrf\', value=_csrf)\n```\n\n**Note:** It is now possible to whitelist certain URLs. In other words you can\nspecify a list of routes that should bypass CSRF verification check.\n\n**Note 2:** To whitelist dynamic URLs use regular expression tests inside the\nCSRF middleware to see if `req.originalUrl` matches your desired pattern.\n\n### I am getting MongoDB Connection Error, how do I fix it?\nThat\'s a custom error message defined in `app.js` to indicate that there was a\nproblem connecting to MongoDB:\n\n```js\nmongoose.connection.on(\'error\', (err) => {\n  console.error(err);\n  console.log(\'%s MongoDB connection error. Please make sure MongoDB is running.\', chalk.red(\'\xe2\x9c\x97\'));\n  process.exit();\n});\n```\nYou need to have a MongoDB server running before launching `app.js`. You can\ndownload MongoDB [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community), or install it via a package manager.\n<img src="http://dc942d419843af05523b-ff74ae13537a01be6cfec5927837dcfe.r14.cf1.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/windows-8-50x50.jpg" height="17">\nWindows users, read [Install MongoDB on Windows](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/).\n\n**Tip:** If you are always connected to the internet, you could just use\n[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or [Compose](https://www.compose.io/) instead\nof downloading and installing MongoDB locally. You will only need to update database credentials\nin `.env` file.\n\n### I get an error when I deploy my app, why?\nChances are you haven\'t changed the *Database URI* in `.env`. If `MONGODB` is\nset to `localhost`, it will only work on your machine as long as MongoDB is\nrunning. When you deploy to Heroku, OpenShift or some other provider, you will not have MongoDB\nrunning on `localhost`. You need to create an account with [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)\nor [Compose](https://www.compose.io/), then create a free tier database.\nSee [Deployment](#deployment) for more information on how to setup an account\nand a new database step-by-step with MongoDB Atlas.\n\n### Why Pug (Jade) instead of Handlebars?\nWhen I first started this project I didn\'t have any experience with Handlebars. Since then I have worked on Ember.js apps and got myself familiar with the Handlebars syntax. While it is true Handlebars is easier, because it looks like good old HTML, I have no regrets picking Jade over Handlebars. First off, it\'s the default template engine in Express, so someone who has built Express apps in the past already knows it. Secondly, I find `extends` and `block` to be indispensable, which as far as I know, Handlebars does not have out of the box. And lastly, subjectively speaking, Jade looks much cleaner and shorter than Handlebars, or any non-HAML style for that matter.\n\n### Why do you have all routes defined in app.js?\nFor the sake of simplicity. While there might be a better approach,\nsuch as passing `app` context to each controller as outlined in this\n[blog](http://timstermatic.github.io/blog/2013/08/17/a-simple-mvc-framework-with-node-and-express/),\nI find such style to be confusing for beginners.\nIt took me a long time to grasp the concept of `exports` and `module.exports`,\nlet alone having a global `app` reference in other files.\nThat to me is backward thinking.\nThe `app.js` is the "heart of the app", it should be the one referencing\nmodels, routes, controllers, etc.\nWhen working solo on small projects, I prefer to have everything inside `app.js` as is the case with [this]((https://github.com/sahat/ember-sass-express-starter/blob/master/app.js))\nREST API server.\n\n### How do I switch SendGrid for another email delivery service, like Mailgun or SparkPost?\nInside the `nodemailer.createTransport` method arguments, change the service from `\'Sendgrid\'` to some other email service. Also, be sure to update both username and password below that. See the [list of all supported services](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer-wellknown#supported-services) by Nodemailer.\n\nHow It Works (mini guides)\n--------------------------\n\nThis section is intended for giving you a detailed explanation of\nhow a particular functionality works. Maybe you are just curious about\nhow it works, or perhaps you are lost and confused while reading the code,\nI hope it provides some guidance to you.\n\n### Custom HTML and CSS Design 101\n\n[HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/) has many beautiful templates that you can download for free.\n\nWhen you download the ZIP file, it will come with *index.html*, *images*, *css* and *js* folders. So, how do you\nintegrate it with Hackathon Starter? Hackathon Starter uses Bootstrap CSS framework, but these templates do not.\nTrying to use both CSS files at the same time will likely result in undesired effects.\n\n**Note:** Using the custom templates approach, you should understand that you cannot reuse any of the views I have created: layout, home page, api browser, login, signup, account management, contact. Those views were built using Bootstrap grid and styles. You will have to manually update the grid using a different syntax provided in the template. **Having said that, you can mix and match if you want to do so: Use Bootstrap for main app interface, and a custom template for a landing page.**\n\nLet\'s start from the beginning. For this example I will use [Escape Velocity](http://html5up.net/escape-velocity/) template:\n![Alt](http://html5up.net/uploads/images/escape-velocity.jpg)\n\n**Note:** For the sake of simplicity I will only consider `index.html`, and skip `left-sidebar.html`,\n`no-sidebar.html`, `right-sidebar.html`.\n\nMove all JavaScript files from `html5up-escape-velocity/js` to `public/js`. Then move all CSS files from `html5up-escape-velocity/css` to `public/css`. And finally, move all images from `html5up-escape-velocity/images` to `public/images`. You could move it to the existing **img** folder, but that would require manually changing every `img` reference. Grab the contents of `index.html` and paste it into [HTML To Pug](https://html-to-pug.com/).\n\n**Note:** Do not forget to update all the CSS and JS paths accordingly.\n\nCreate a new file `escape-velocity.pug` and paste the Pug markup in `views` folder.\nWhenever you see the code `res.render(\'account/login\')` - that means it will search for `views/account/login.pug` file.\n\nLet\'s see how it looks. Create a new controller **escapeVelocity** inside `controllers/home.js`:\n\n```js\nexports.escapeVelocity = (req, res) => {\n  res.render(\'escape-velocity\', {\n    title: \'Landing Page\'\n  });\n};\n```\n\nAnd then create a route in `app.js`. I placed it right after the index controller:\n```js\napp.get(\'/escape-velocity\', homeController.escapeVelocity);\n```\n\nRestart the server (if you are not using **nodemon**); then you should see the new template at [http://localhost:8080/escape-velocity](http://localhost:8080/escape-velocity).\n\nI will stop right here, but if you would like to use this template as more than just a single page, take a look at how these Pug templates work: `layout.pug` - base template, `index.pug` - home page, `partials/header.pug` - Bootstrap navbar, `partials/footer.pug` - sticky footer. You will have to manually break it apart into smaller pieces. Figure out which part of the template you want to keep the same on all pages - that\'s your new `layout.pug`.\nThen, each page that changes, be it `index.pug`, `about.pug`, `contact.pug`\nwill be embedded in your new `layout.pug` via `block content`. Use existing templates as a reference.\n\nThis is a rather lengthy process, and templates you get from elsewhere might have yet another grid system. That\'s why I chose *Bootstrap* for the Hackathon Starter.\n Many people are already familiar with *Bootstrap*, plus it\'s easy to get started with it if you have never used *Bootstrap*.\n You can also buy many beautifully designed *Bootstrap* themes at [Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/), and use them as a drop-in replacement for Hackathon Starter. However, if you would like to go with a completely custom HTML/CSS design, this should help you to get started!\n\n<hr>\n\n### How do flash messages work in this project?\nFlash messages allow you to display a message at the end of the request and access\nit on next request and only next request. For instance, on a failed login attempt, you would\ndisplay an alert with some error message, but as soon as you refresh that page or visit a different\npage and come back to the login page, that error message will be gone. It is only displayed once.\nThis project uses *express-flash* module for flash messages. And that\nmodule is built on top of *connect-flash*, which is what I used in\nthis project initially. With *express-flash* you don\'t have to\nexplicitly send a flash message to every view inside `res.render()`.\nAll flash messages are available in your views via `messages` object by default,\nthanks to *express-flash*.\n\nFlash messages have a two-step process. You use `req.flash(\'errors\', { msg: \'Error messages goes here\' }`\nto create a flash message in your controllers, and then display them in your views:\n```pug\nif messages.errors\n  .alert.alert-danger.fade.in\n    for error in messages.errors\n      div= error.msg\n```\nIn the first step, `\'errors\'` is the name of a flash message, which should match the\nname of the property on `messages` object in your views. You place alert messages\ninside `if message.errors` because you don\'t want to show them flash messages are present.\nThe reason why you pass an error like `{ msg: \'Error message goes here\' }` instead\nof just a string - `\'Error message goes here\'`, is for the sake of consistency.\nTo clarify that, *express-validator* module which is used for validating and sanitizing user\'s input,\nreturns all errors as an array of objects, where each object has a `msg` property with a message why an error has occurred. Here is a more general example of what express-validator returns when there are errors present:\n\n```js\n[\n  { param: "name", msg: "Name is required", value: "<received input>" },\n  { param: "email", msg: "A valid email is required", value: "<received input>" }\n]\n```\n\nTo keep consistent with that style, you should pass all flash messages\nas `{ msg: \'My flash message\' }` instead of a string. Otherwise, you will see an alert box\nwithout an error message. That is because in **partials/flash.pug** template it will try to output\n`error.msg` (i.e. `"My flash message".msg`), in other words, it will try to call a `msg` method on a *String* object,\nwhich will return *undefined*. Everything I just mentioned about errors, also applies\nto "info" and "success" flash messages, and you could even create a new one yourself, such as:\n\n**Data Usage Controller (Example)**\n```\nreq.flash(\'warning\', { msg: \'You have exceeded 90% of your data usage\' });\n```\n\n**User Account Page (Example)**\n```pug\nif messages.warning\n  .alert.alert-warning.fade.in\n    for warning in messages.warning\n      div= warning.msg\n```\n\n`partials/flash.pug` is a partial template that contains how flash messages\nare formatted. Previously, flash\nmessages were scattered throughout each view that used flash messages\n(contact, login, signup, profile), but now, thankfully it uses a *DRY* approach.\n\nThe flash messages partial template is *included* in the `layout.pug`, along with footer and navigation.\n```pug\nbody\n    include partials/header\n\n    .container\n      include partials/flash\n      block content\n\n    include partials/footer\n```\n\nIf you have any further questions about flash messages,\nplease feel free to open an issue, and I will update this mini-guide accordingly,\nor send a pull request if you would like to include something that I missed.\n\n<hr>\n\n### How do I create a new page?\nA more correct way to say this would be "How do I create a new route?" The main file `app.js` contains all the routes.\nEach route has a callback function associated with it. Sometimes you will see three or more arguments for a route. In a case like that, the first argument is still a URL string, while middle arguments\nare what\'s called middleware. Think of middleware as a door. If this door prevents you from\ncontinuing forward, you won\'t get to your callback function. One such example is a route that requires authentication.\n\n```js\napp.get(\'/account\', passportConfig.isAuthenticated, userController.getAccount);\n```\n\nIt always goes from left to right. A user visits `/account` page. Then `isAuthenticated` middleware checks if you are authenticated:\n\n```js\nexports.isAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {\n  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {\n    return next();\n  }\n  res.redirect(\'/login\');\n};\n```\n\nIf you are authenticated, you let this visitor pass through your "door" by calling `return next();`. It then proceeds to the\nnext middleware until it reaches the last argument, which is a callback function that typically renders a template on `GET` requests or redirects on `POST` requests. In this case, if you are authenticated, you will be redirected to the *Account Management* page; otherwise, you will be redirected to the *Login* page.\n\n```js\nexports.getAccount = (req, res) => {\n  res.render(\'account/profile\', {\n    title: \'Account Management\'\n  });\n};\n```\n\nExpress.js has `app.get`, `app.post`, `app.put`, `app.delete`, but for the most part, you will only use the first two HTTP verbs, unless you are building a RESTful API.\nIf you just want to display a page, then use `GET`, if you are submitting a form, sending a file then use `POST`.\n\nHere is a typical workflow for adding new routes to your application. Let\'s say we are building a page that lists all books from the database.\n\n**Step 1.** Start by defining a route.\n```js\napp.get(\'/books\', bookController.getBooks);\n```\n\n---\n\n**Note:** As of Express 4.x you can define your routes like so:\n\n```js\napp.route(\'/books\')\n  .get(bookController.getBooks)\n  .post(bookController.createBooks)\n  .put(bookController.updateBooks)\n  .delete(bookController.deleteBooks)\n```\n\nAnd here is how a route would look if it required an *authentication* and an *authorization* middleware:\n\n```js\napp.route(\'/api/twitter\')\n  .all(passportConfig.isAuthenticated)\n  .all(passportConfig.isAuthorized)\n  .get(apiController.getTwitter)\n  .post(apiController.postTwitter)\n```\n\nUse whichever style that makes sense to you. Either one is acceptable. I think that chaining HTTP verbs on `app.route` is a very clean and elegant approach, but on the other hand, I can no longer see all my routes at a glance when you have one route per line.\n\n**Step 2.** Create a new schema and a model `Book.js` inside the *models* directory.\n```js\nconst mongoose = require(\'mongoose\');\n\nconst bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  name: String\n});\n\nconst Book = mongoose.model(\'Book\', bookSchema);\nmodule.exports = Book;\n```\n\n**Step 3.** Create a new controller file called `book.js` inside the *controllers* directory.\n```js\n/**\n * GET /books\n * List all books.\n */\nconst Book = require(\'../models/Book.js\');\n\nexports.getBooks = (req, res) => {\n  Book.find((err, docs) => {\n    res.render(\'books\', { books: docs });\n  });\n};\n```\n\n**Step 4.** Import that controller in `app.js`.\n```js\nconst bookController = require(\'./controllers/book\');\n```\n\n**Step 5.** Create `books.pug` template.\n```pug\nextends layout\n\nblock content\n  .page-header\n    h3 All Books\n\n  ul\n    for book in books\n      li= book.name\n```\n\nThat\'s it! I will say that you could have combined Step 1, 2, 3 as following:\n\n```js\napp.get(\'/books\',(req, res) => {\n  Book.find((err, docs) => {\n    res.render(\'books\', { books: docs });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nSure, it\'s simpler, but as soon as you pass 1000 lines of code in `app.js` it becomes a little challenging to navigate the file.\nI mean, the whole point of this boilerplate project was to separate concerns, so you could\nwork with your teammates without running into *MERGE CONFLICTS*. Imagine you have four developers\nworking on a single `app.js`, I promise you it won\'t be fun resolving merge conflicts all the time.\nIf you are the only developer, then it\'s okay. But as I said, once it gets up to a certain LoC size, it becomes difficult to maintain everything in a single file.\n\nThat\'s all there is to it. Express.js is super simple to use.\nMost of the time you will be dealing with other APIs to do the real work:\n[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) for querying database, socket.io for sending and receiving messages over websockets,\nsending emails via [Nodemailer](http://nodemailer.com/), form validation using [express-validator](https://github.com/ctavan/express-validator) library,\nparsing websites using [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), etc.\n\n<hr>\n\n### How do I use Socket.io with Hackathon Starter?\n[Dan Stroot](https://github.com/dstroot) submitted an excellent [pull request](https://github.com/dstroot/hackathon-starter/commit/0a632def1ce8da446709d92812423d337c977d75) that adds a real-time dashboard with socket.io.\nAnd as  much as I\'d like to add it to the project, I think it violates one of the main\nprinciples of the Hackathon Starter:\n> When I started this project, my primary focus was on simplicity and ease of use.\n> I also tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible to cover most use cases of\n> hackathon web apps, **without being too specific**.\n\nWhen I need to use socket.io, I **really** need it, but most of the time - I don\'t. But more importantly, websockets support is still experimental on most hosting providers. As of October 2013,\nHeroku supports websockets, but not until you opt-in by running this command:\n\n```js\nheroku labs:enable websockets -a myapp\n```\n\nAnd what if you are deploying to OpenShift? They do support websockets, but it is currently in a\npreview state. So, for OpenShift you would need to change the socket.io connect URI to the following:\n\n```js\nconst socket = io.connect(\'http://yoursite-namespace.rhcloud.com:8000\');\n```\n\nWait, why is it on port 8000? Who knows, and if I didn\'t run across this [blog post](http://velin-georgiev-blog.appspot.com/blog/set-up-nodejs-express-socketio-application-using-websockets-on-openshift-by-red-hat/)\nI wouldn\'t even know I had to use port 8000.\n\nI am really glad that Heroku and OpenShift at least\nhave a websockets support, because many other PaaS providers still do not support it.\nDue to the aforementioned issues with websockets, I cannot include socket.io as part of the Hackathon Starter. *For now...*\nIf you need to use socket.io in your app, please continue reading.\n\nFirst, you need to install socket.io:\n```js\nnpm install socket.io\n```\n\nReplace `const app = express();` with the following code:\n\n```js\nconst app = express();\nconst server = require(\'http\').Server(app);\nconst io = require(\'socket.io\')(server);\n```\n\nI like to have the following code organization in `app.js` (from top to bottom): module dependencies,\nimport controllers, import configs, connect to database, express configuration, routes,\nstart the server, socket.io stuff. That way I always know where to look for things.\n\nAdd the following code at the end of `app.js`:\n\n```js\nio.on(\'connection\', (socket) => {\n  socket.emit(\'greet\', { hello: \'Hey there browser!\' });\n  socket.on(\'respond\', (data) => {\n    console.log(data);\n  });\n  socket.on(\'disconnect\', () => {\n    console.log(\'Socket disconnected\');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nOne last thing left to change:\n```js\napp.listen(app.get(\'port\'), () => {\n```\nto\n```js\nserver.listen(app.get(\'port\'), () => {\n```\n\nAt this point, we are done with the back-end.\n\nYou now have a choice - to include your JavaScript code in Pug templates or have all your client-side\nJavaScript in a separate file - in `main.js`. I admit, when I first started with Node.js and JavaScript in general,\nI placed all JavaScript code inside templates because I have access to template variables passed in from Express\nright then and there. It\'s the easiest thing you can do, but also the least efficient and harder to maintain. Since then I\nalmost never include inline JavaScript inside templates anymore.\n\nBut it\'s also understandable if you want to take the easier road.\nMost of the time you don\'t even care about performance during hackathons, you just\nwant to [*"get shit done"*](https://www.startupvitamins.com/media/products/13/aaron_levie_poster_black.jpg) before the time runs out.\nWell, either way, use whichever approach makes more sense to you. At the end of the day,\nit\'s **what** you build that matters, not **how** you build it.\n\nIf you want to stick all your JavaScript inside templates, then in `layout.pug` -\nyour main template file, add this to `head` block.\n\n```pug\nscript(src=\'/socket.io/socket.io.js\')\nscript.\n    let socket = io.connect(window.location.href);\n    socket.on(\'greet\', function (data) {\n      console.log(data);\n      socket.emit(\'respond\', { message: \'Hey there, server!\' });\n    });\n```\n\n**Note:** Notice the path of the `socket.io.js`, you don\'t actually\nhave to have `socket.io.js` file anywhere in your project; it will be generated\nautomatically at runtime.\n\nIf you want to have JavaScript code separate from templates, move that inline\nscript code into `main.js`, inside the `$(document).ready()` function:\n\n```js\n$(document).ready(function() {\n\n  // Place JavaScript code here...\n  let socket = io.connect(window.location.href);\n  socket.on(\'greet\', function (data) {\n    console.log(data);\n    socket.emit(\'respond\', { message: \'Hey there, server!\' });\n  });\n\n});\n```\n\nAnd we are done!\n\nCheatsheets\n-----------\n\n### <img src="https://frontendmasters.com/assets/es6-logo.png" height="34" align="top"> ES6 Cheatsheet\n\n#### Declarations\n\nDeclares a read-only named constant.\n\n```js\nconst name = \'yourName\';\n```\n\nDeclares a block scope local variable.\n```js\nlet index = 0;\n```\n\n#### Template Strings\n\nUsing the **\\`${}\\`** syntax, strings can embed expressions.\n\n```js\nconst name = \'Oggy\';\nconst age = 3;\n\nconsole.log(`My cat is named ${name} and is ${age} years old.`);\n```\n\n#### Modules\n\nTo import functions, objects or primitives exported from an external module. These are the most common types of importing.\n\n```js\nconst name = require(\'module-name\');\n```\n\n```js\nconst { foo, bar } = require(\'module-name\');\n```\n\nTo export functions, objects or primitives from a given file or module.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = { myFunction };\n```\n\n```js\nmodule.exports.name = \'yourName\';\n```\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = myFunctionOrClass;\n```\n\n#### Spread Operator\n\nThe spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.\n\n```js\nmyFunction(...iterableObject);\n```\n```jsx\n<ChildComponent {...this.props} />\n```\n\n#### Promises\n\nA Promise is used in asynchronous computations to represent an operation that hasn\'t completed yet, but is expected in the future.\n\n```js\nvar p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { });\n```\n\nThe `catch()` method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only.\n\n```js\np.catch(function(reason) { /* handle rejection */ });\n```\n\nThe `then()` method returns a Promise. It takes two arguments: callback for the success & failure cases.\n\n```js\np.then(function(value) { /* handle fulfillment */ }, function(reason) { /* handle rejection */ });\n```\n\nThe `Promise.all(iterable)` method returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved or rejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects.\n\n```js\nPromise.all([p1, p2, p3]).then(function(values) { console.log(values) });\n```\n\n#### Arrow Functions\n\nArrow function expression. Shorter syntax & lexically binds the `this` value. Arrow functions are anonymous.\n\n```js\nsingleParam => { statements }\n```\n```js\n() => { statements }\n```\n```js\n(param1, param2) => expression\n```\n```js\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst squares = arr.map(x => x * x);\n```\n\n#### Classes\n\nThe class declaration creates a new class using prototype-based inheritance.\n\n```js\nclass Person {\n  constructor(name, age, gender) {\n    this.name   = name;\n    this.age    = age;\n    this.gender = gender;\n  }\n\n  incrementAge() {\n    this.age++;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n:gift: **Credits**: [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=es6+cheatsheet&ia=cheatsheet&iax=1) and [@DrkSephy](https://github.com/DrkSephy/es6-cheatsheet).\n\n:top: <sub>[**back to top**](#table-of-contents)</sub>\n\n### <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mmww2.png" height="34" align="top"> JavaScript Date Cheatsheet\n\n#### Unix Timestamp (seconds)\n\n```js\nMath.floor(Date.now() / 1000);\n```\n\n```MomentJS\nmoment().unix();\n```\n\n#### Add 30 minutes to a Date object\n\n```js\nvar now = new Date();\nnow.setMinutes(now.getMinutes() + 30);\n```\n\n```MomentJS\nmoment().add(30, \'minutes\');\n```\n\n#### Date Formatting\n\n```js\n// DD-MM-YYYY\nvar now = new Date();\n\nvar DD = now.getDate();\nvar MM = now.getMonth() + 1;\nvar YYYY = now.getFullYear();\n\nif (DD < 10) {\n  DD = \'0\' + DD;\n}\n\nif (MM < 10) {\n  MM = \'0\' + MM;\n}\n\nconsole.log(MM + \'-\' + DD + \'-\' + YYYY); // 03-30-2016\n```\n```MomentJS\nconsole.log(moment(new Date(), \'MM-DD-YYYY\'));\n```\n\n```js\n// hh:mm (12 hour time with am/pm)\nvar now = new Date();\nvar hours = now.getHours();\nvar minutes = now.getMinutes();\nvar amPm = hours >= 12 ? \'pm\' : \'am\';\n\nhours = hours % 12;\nhours = hours ? hours : 12;\nminutes = minutes < 10 ? \'0\' + minutes : minutes;\n\nconsole.log(hours + \':\' + minutes + \' \' + amPm); // 1:43 am\n```\n\n```MomentJS\nconsole.log(moment(new Date(), \'hh:mm A\'));\n```\n\n#### Next week Date object\n\n```js\nvar today = new Date();\nvar nextWeek = new Date(today.getTime() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);\n```\n\n```MomentJS\nmoment().add(7, \'days\');\n```\n\n#### Yesterday Date object\n\n```js\nvar today = new Date();\nvar yesterday = date.setDate(date.getDate() - 1);\n```\n\n```MomentJS\nmoment().add(-1, \'days\');\n```\n\n:top: <sub>[**back to top**](#table-of-contents)</sub>\n\n### Mongoose Cheatsheet\n\n#### Find all users:\n```js\nUser.find((err, users) => {\n  console.log(users);\n});\n```\n\n#### Find a user by email:\n```js\nlet userEmail = \'example@gmail.com\';\nUser.findOne({ email: userEmail }, (err, user) => {\n  console.log(user);\n});\n```\n\n#### Find 5 most recent user accounts:\n```js\nUser\n  .find()\n  .sort({ _id: -1 })\n  .limit(5)\n  .exec((err, users) => {\n    console.log(users);\n  });\n```\n\n#### Get the total count of a field from all documents:\nLet\'s suppose that each user has a `votes` field and you would like to count\nthe total number of votes in your database across all users.

Or you could use [MongoDB Aggregation Framework](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/aggregation-introduction/) instead:\n\n```js\nUser.aggregate({ $group: { _id: null, total: { $sum: \'$votes\' } } }, (err, votesCount)  => {\n  console.log(votesCount.total);\n});\n```\n:top: <sub>[**back to top**](#table-of-contents)</sub>\n\nDocker\n----------\n\nYou will need docker and docker-compose installed to build the application.\n\n- [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)\n\n- [Common problems setting up docker](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/faqs/troubleshoot/)\n\nAfter installing docker, start the application with the following commands :\n\n```\n# To build the project for the first time or when you add dependencies\ndocker-compose build web\n\n# To start the application (or to restart after making changes to the source code)\ndocker-compose up web\n\n```\n\nTo view the app, find your docker IP address + port 8080 ( this will typically be http://localhost:8080/ ).  To use a port other than 8080, you would need to modify the port in app.js, Dockerfile, and docker-compose.yml.\n\n\nDeployment\n----------\n\nOnce you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with a cloud platform to host it. These are not the only choices, but they are my top picks. From my experience, the easiest way to get started is with **Heroku**. It will automatically restart your Node.js process when it crashes, has zero-downtime deployments and supports custom domains on free accounts. Additionally, you can\ncreate an account with **MongoDB Atlas** and then pick one of the *4* providers below.\nAgain, there are plenty of other choices, and you are not limited to just the ones\nlisted below.\n\n### 1-Step Deployment with Heroku\n\n<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a9/Heroku_logo.png" width="200">\n\n- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)\n- In a terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials\n- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`\n- Run `heroku addons:create mongolab`.  This will set up the mLab add-on and configure the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable in your Heroku app for you.\n- Lastly, do `git push heroku master`.  Done!\n\n**Note:** To install Heroku add-ons your account must be verified.\n\n---\n\n### Hosted MongoDB Atlas\n\n<img src="https://www.mongodb.com/assets/images/global/MongoDB_Logo_Dark.svg" width="200">\n\n- Go to [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)\n- Click the green **Get started free** button\n- Fill in your information then hit **Get started free**\n- You will be redirected to Create New Cluster page.\n- Select a **Cloud Provider and Region** (such as AWS and a free tier region)\n- Select cluster Tier to **Free Shared Clusters**\n- Give Cluster a name (default: Cluster0)\n- Click on green **:zap:Create Cluster button**\n- Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user. To create a new MongoDB user, from the **Clusters view**, select the **Security tab**\n- Under the **MongoDB Users** tab, click on **+Add New User**\n- Fill in a username and password and give it either **Atlas Admin** User Privilege\n- Next, you will need to create an IP address whitelist and obtain the connection URI.  In the Clusters view, under the cluster details (i.e. SANDBOX - Cluster0), click on the **CONNECT** button.\n- Under section **(1) Check the IP Whitelist**, click on **ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE**. The form will add a field with `0.0.0.0/0`.  Click **SAVE** to save the `0.0.0.0/0` whitelist.\n- Under section **(2) Choose a connection method**, click on **Connect Your Application**\n- In the new screen, select **Node.js** as Driver and version **2.2.12 or later**. _*WARNING*_: Do not pick 3.0 or later since connect-mongo can\'t handle mongodb+srv:// connection strings.\n- Finally, copy the URI connection string and replace the URI in MONGODB_URI of `.env.example` with this URI string.  Make sure to replace the <PASSWORD> with the db User password that you created under the Security tab.\n- Note that after some of the steps in the Atlas UI, you may see a banner stating `We are deploying your changes`.  You will need to wait for the deployment to finish before using the DB in your application.\n\n\n**Note:** As an alternative to MongoDB Atlas, there is also [Compose](https://www.compose.io/).\n\n---\n\n### OpenShift\n\n<img src="http://www.opencloudconf.com/images/openshift_logo.png" width="200">\n**NOTE** *These instructions might be out of date due to changes in OpenShift. Heroku is currently a good free alternative.  If you the new process, please feel free to help us update this page*\n\n- First, install this Ruby gem: `sudo gem install rhc` :gem:\n- Run `rhc login` and enter your OpenShift credentials\n- From your app directory run `rhc app create MyApp nodejs-0.10`\n - **Note:** *MyApp* is the name of your app (no spaces)\n- Once that is done, you will be provided with **URL**, **SSH** and **Git Remote** links\n- Visit provided **URL**, and you should see the *Welcome to your Node.js application on OpenShift* page\n- Copy and paste **Git Remote** into `git remote add openshift YOUR_GIT_REMOTE`\n- Before you push your app, you need to do a few modifications to your code\n\nAdd these two lines to `app.js`, just place them anywhere before `app.listen()`:\n```js\nvar IP_ADDRESS = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP || \'127.0.0.1\';\nvar PORT = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT || 8080;\n```\n\nThen change `app.listen()` to:\n```js\napp.listen(PORT, IP_ADDRESS,() => {\n  console.log(`Express server listening on port ${PORT} in ${app.settings.env} mode`);\n});\n```\nAdd this to `package.json`, after *name* and *version*. This is necessary because, by default, OpenShift looks for `server.js` file. And by specifying `supervisor app.js` it will automatically restart the server when node.js process crashes.\n\n```js\n"main": "app.js",\n"scripts": {\n  "start": "supervisor app.js"\n},\n```\n\n- Finally, you can now push your code to OpenShift by running `git push -f openshift master`\n - **Note:** The first time you run this command, you have to pass `-f` (force) flag because OpenShift creates a dummy server with the welcome page when you create a new Node.js app. Passing `-f` flag will override everything with your *Hackathon Starter* project repository. **Do not** run `git pull` as it will create unnecessary merge conflicts.\n- And you are done!\n\n---\n\n### Azure\n\n<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Windows_Azure_logo.png" width="200">\n**NOTE** *Beyond the initial 12 month trial of Azure, the platform does not seem to offer a free tier for hosting NodeJS apps.

Create a Bluemix Account\n\n    [Sign up](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?target=%2Fdashboard%2Fapps) for Bluemix, or use an existing account.\n\n1. Download and install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) to push your applications to Bluemix.\n\n1. Create a `manifest.yml` file in the root of your application.\n  ```\n  applications:\n  - name:      <your-app-name>\n    host:      <your-app-host>\n    memory:    128M\n    services:\n    - myMongo-db-name\n  ```\n\n  The host you use will determinate your application URL initially, e.g. `<host>.mybluemix.net`.\n  The service name \'myMongo-db-name\' is a declaration of your MongoDB service.  If you are using other services like Watson for example, then you would declare them the same way.\n\n1. Connect and login to Bluemix via the Cloud-foundry CLI\n  ```\n  $ cf login -a https://api.ng.bluemix.net\n  ```\n\n1. Create a [MongoDB service](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/MongoDB/index.html#MongoDB)\n  ```\n  $ cf create-service mongodb 100 [your-service-name]\n  ```\n  **Note:** this is a free and experiment verion of MongoDB instance.\n  Use the MongoDB by Compose instance for production applications:\n  ```\n  $ cf create-service compose-for-mongodb Standard [your-service-name]\'\n  ```\n\n\n1. Push the application\n\n    ```\n    $ cf push\n    ```\n    ```\n    $ cf env <your-app-name >\n    (To view the *environment variables* created for your application)\n\n    ```\n\n**Done**, now go to the staging domain (`<host>.mybluemix.net`) and see your app running.\n\n[Cloud Foundry Commands](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/index.html)\n[More Bluemix samples](https://ibm-bluemix.github.io/)\n[Simple ToDo app in a programming language of your choice](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/todo-apps)\n\n\n### IBM Watson\nBe sure to check out the full list of Watson services to forwarder enhance your application functionality with a little effort.
