If you want to use Outline then you don\'t need to run this code, we offer a hosted version of the app at [getoutline.com](https://www.getoutline.com).\n\nIf you\'d like to run your own copy of Outline or contribute to development then this is the place for you.\n\n## Installation\n\nOutline requires the following dependencies:\n\n- Node.js >= 12\n- Postgres >=9.5\n- Redis\n- AWS S3 storage bucket for media and other attachments\n- Slack or Google developer application for authentication\n\n\n### Development\n\nIn development you can quickly get an environment running using Docker by following these steps:\n\n1. Clone this repo\n1. Install [Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com) if you don\'t already have it\n1. Register a Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps\n1. Copy the file `.env.sample` to `.env`\n1. Fill out the following fields:\n    1. `SECRET_KEY` (follow instructions in the comments of `.env`)\n    1. `SLACK_KEY` (this is called "Client ID" in Slack admin)\n    1. `SLACK_SECRET`\n1. Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/slack.callback` as an Oauth callback URL in Slack App settings\n1. Run `make up`. This will download dependencies, build and launch a development version of Outline\n\n\n### Production\n\nFor a self-hosted production installation there is more flexibility, but these are the suggested steps:\n\n1. Clone this repo and install dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install`\n\n   > Requires [Node.js, npm](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed\n\n1. Build the web app with `yarn build:webpack` or `npm run build:webpack`\n1. Copy the file `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill out at least the essential fields:\n    1. `SECRET_KEY` (follow instructions in the comments of `.env`)\n    1. `SLACK_KEY` (this is called "Client ID" in Slack admin)\n    1. `SLACK_SECRET`\n    1. `DATABASE_URL` (run your own local copy of Postgres, or use a cloud service)\n    1. `REDIS_URL`  (run your own local copy of Redis, or use a cloud service)\n    1. `URL` (the public facing URL of your installation)\n    1. `AWS_` (all of the keys beginning with AWS)\n1. Migrate database schema with `yarn sequelize:migrate` or `npm run sequelize:migrate `\n1. Start the service with any daemon tools you prefer. Take PM2 for example, `NODE_ENV=production pm2 start index.js --name outline `\n1. Visit http://you_server_ip:3000 and you should be able to see Outline page\n\n   > Port number can be changed in the `.env` file\n\n1. (Optional) You can add an `nginx` reverse proxy to serve your instance of Outline for a clean URL without the port number, support SSL, etc.\n\n\n## Development\n\n### Server\n\nOutline uses [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug). To enable debugging output, the following categories are available:\n\n```\nDEBUG=sql,cache,presenters,events,logistics,emails,mailer\n```\n\n## Migrations\n\nSequelize is used to create and run migrations, for example:\n\n```\nyarn sequelize migration:generate --name my-migration\nyarn sequelize db:migrate\n```\n\nOr to run migrations on test database:\n\n```\nyarn sequelize db:migrate --env test\n```\n\n## Structure\n\nOutline is composed of separate backend and frontend application which are both driven by the same Node process. As both are written in Javascript, they share some code but are mostly separate. We utilize the latest language features, including `async`/`await`, and [Flow](https://flow.org/) typing. Prettier and ESLint are enforced by CI.\n\n### Frontend\n\nOutline\'s frontend is a React application compiled with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). It uses [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/) for state management and [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for component styles. Unless global, state logic and styles are always co-located with React components together with their subcomponents to make the component tree easier to manage.\n\nThe editor itself is built ontop of [Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate) and hosted in a separate repository to encourage reuse: [rich-markdown-editor](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor)\n\n- `app/` - Frontend React application\n- `app/scenes` - Full page views\n- `app/components` - Reusable React components\n- `app/stores` - Global state stores\n- `app/models` - State models\n- `app/types` - Flow types for non-models\n\n### Backend\n\nBackend is driven by [Koa](http://koajs.com/) (API, web server), [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) (database) and React for public pages and emails.\n\n- `server/api` - API endpoints\n- `server/commands` - Domain logic, currently being refactored from /models\n- `server/emails`  - React rendered email templates\n- `server/models` - Database models\n- `server/pages` - Server-side rendered public pages\n- `server/policies` - Authorization logic\n- `server/presenters` - API responses for database models\n- `server/test` - Test helps and support\n- `server/utils` - Utility methods\n- `shared` - Code shared between frontend and backend applications\n\n## Tests\n\nWe aim to have sufficient test coverage for critical parts of the application and aren\'t aiming for 100% unit test coverage. All API endpoints and anything authentication related should be thoroughly tested.\n\nTo add new tests, write your tests with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and add a file with `.test.js` extension next to the tested code.\n\n```shell\n# To run all tests\nyarn test\n\n# To run backend tests\nyarn test:server\n\n# To run frontend tests\nyarn test:app\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nOutline is built and maintained by a small team \xe2\x80\x93 we\'d love your help to fix bugs and add features!\n\nHowever, before working on a pull request please let the core team know by creating or commenting in an issue on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/outline/outline/issues), and we\'d also love to hear from you in our [Spectrum community](https://spectrum.chat/outline). This way we can ensure that an approach is agreed on before code is written and will hopefully help to get your contributions integrated faster! Take a look at our [roadmap](https://www.getoutline.com/share/3e6cb2b5-d68b-4ad8-8900-062476820311).\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for ways to get started, here\'s a list of ways to help us improve Outline:\n\n* Issues with [`good first issue`](https://github.com/outline/outline/labels/good%20first%20issue) label\n* Performance improvements, both on server and frontend\n* Developer happiness and documentation\n* Bugs and other issues listed on GitHub\n* Helping others on Spectrum\n\n## License\n\nOutline is [BSD licensed](https://github.com/outline/outline/blob/master/LICENSE).\n'
