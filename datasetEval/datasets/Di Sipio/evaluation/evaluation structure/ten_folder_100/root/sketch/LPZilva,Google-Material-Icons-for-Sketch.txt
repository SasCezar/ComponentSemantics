b'### (Discontinued) Google Material Icons for Sketch - [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/LPZilva/Google-Material-Icons-for-Sketch/archive/master.zip) | [\xf0\x9f\x90\xa6 Twitter](http://twitter.com/lpzilva) \xe2\x80\xa2 [\xf0\x9f\x8f\x80 Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/lpzilva)\n\nBecause Google Design team did a really good job with its new **[Material Theme Editor](https://material.io/tools/theme-editor/)** plugin, I decided to stop supporting future updates. The plugin has lots of features and resources, including new set of icons (Filled, Sharp, Rounded, Two-Toned, and Outined icons).\n\nFor more information, please check the **[Material Theme Editor](https://material.io/tools/theme-editor/)** website.\n\nA special thanks to everyone who supported this project. \xf0\x9f\xa4\x97\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nGoogle Material Icons for Sketch is a Google icon set for Sketch App. These are originally from Google library, which I\'ll try to keep updated.\n \n![](http://i.imgur.com/FVXkIBw.png) \n\n### Screenshots\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OYACe85.png)\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n#### Icons Update 2.2\n\nThe 2.2 update adds 41 new icons.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n## File fixes and improvements:\n\nA HUGE Thanks [imaaronjames](https://github.com/imaaronjames) and [jpwain](https://github.com/jpwain) for improving the structure & organization of the file!\n\n#### Sketch file updates:\n\n#### v1.1 - Improved structure & organization by [imaaronjames](https://github.com/imaaronjames)\n* Removed nested folders\n* Removed all masks and clipping groups\n* Consolidated all paths into one compound path per icon\n* Consistently renamed all folders, icons, bounds, and paths to match Material Icons\n* Reordered canvas from A-Z\n* Reordered layers from A-Z\n\n#### v1.2 - Improved info and coordinates by [jpwain](https://github.com/jpwain)\n* Moved the artboards to start at 0,0 coordinate.\n* Added an _About artboard\n* Added a version string for the file (because it varies from the Google release number) to the About artboard.\n* Set file version to 1.2, tentatively, calling [@imaaronjames](https://github.com/imaaronjames) update 1.1.\n* Added github project URL to the About artboard.\n\n#### v1.3 - Improved pixel perfection and scalable aspect ratio\n* Fixed icons size where sometimes, could be slightly off the pixel grid\n* Locked aspect ratio in order to keep scalable icons consistent\n\n#### v1.4 - Minor icons updates\n* Some of the the icons found at the official Google Material Icons website, don\'t match the .svg/.png files, when downloaded. (i.e. ic_person_pin, and almost every ic_sentiment); I\'ve manually fixed them. You can still find the "outdated" versions of those same icons in the file.\n* ic_photo_filter updated\n\n#### v2.0 - Converting Sketch file to Shared Library\n* Converted icons to symbols\n* Added `How to Sketch Library` artboard\n* Split symbol icons into their respective categories, i.e. Action, Alert, AV, etc.\n'
