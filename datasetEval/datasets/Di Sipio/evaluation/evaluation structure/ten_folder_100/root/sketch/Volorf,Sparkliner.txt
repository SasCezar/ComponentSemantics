b'# Sparkliner \xe2\x80\x94 easy way to make sparkline graph\n> A sparkline is a very small line chart, typically drawn without axes or coordinates. It presents the general shape of the variation (typically over time) in some measurement, such as temperature or stock market price, in a simple and highly condensed way.\n> - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline).\n\n## How it works\n![Gif more than thousand words](/how-to.gif)\n\n##Order\n1. **Create an artboard**;\n2. Create a start rectangle. It sets sizes of a future sparkline graph;\n3. Start command from menu or press shortcuts `ctrl + shift + g `;\n4. Find and import your JSON file;\n5. Get sparkline.\n\n## How install the plugin\n1. [Download the zip file with the Sparkliner](https://github.com/Volorf/Sparkliner/archive/master.zip).\n2. Copy the contents to the Plugin Folder (Plugin > Manage Plugins... > [Show Plugins Folder](http://frolovoleg.ru/images/sketch-plugin-folder.png)).\n\n## What do you need first\nSparkliner creates graph with JSON data. First your need have it. It looks like that (example.json):\n\n``` json\n{\n  "dataArray": [10, 30, 3, 8, 39, 25, 22, 89, 74, 7, 2, 40, 61, 17, 35, 31, 8, 14, 39, 32, 53],\n  "strokeColor": "#00AAFF",\n  "thickness": 1,\n  "displayEndPoint": true,\n  "endPointColor": "#DD2020",\n  "endPointRadius": 2,\n  "removeInitialBox": true\n}\n```\nOpen the file in your favorite editor and change the values of the names how you need (e.g. `"strokeColor" ` is a name. `"#00AAFF"` is its a value. Together they are a pair). Or create new one.\n\n## What are they\n\n``` "dataArray" ```\nData is an array. It defines a graph curve. Only numbers.\n\n``` "strokeColor" ```\nColor of sparkline. You need to write HEX color here. Don\'t forget about "quotes".\n\n``` "thickness" ```\nThickness of line. Only one number.\n\n``` "displayEndPoint" ```\nIf it equals true sparkline is made with an end marker. If it equals false - it is not.\n\n``` "endPointColor" ```\nColor of end marker. It needs a HEX.\n\n``` "endPointRadius" ```\nRadius of end marker. Only one number.\n\n``` "removeInitialBox" ```\nIt is start rectangle that set sizes of sparkline graph. By default plugin removes it. If you need it you can set false.\n\n## Links\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleg-frolov-6a6a4752/) | [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/Volorf) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/volorf)\n'
