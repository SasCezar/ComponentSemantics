b'OpenSSE: Open Sketch Search Engine [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zddhub/opensse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zddhub/opensse)\n==================================\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/zddhub/opensse?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\nHello everybody!\n\nI\'m very interested in [Mathias Eitz\'s works](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/sbsr/) on SIGGRAPH 2012, so I developed OpenSSE, Just for fun.\n\nThis is an open source sketch search engine for 3D object retrieval based on sketch image as input. In fact, it can retrieve more, such as images, videos, point cloud models and volume models, you just need get their line drawing images than I know you can.\n\nIn order to clearly show how to work, I used single thread and ascii encoding for file storage.\n\nZhang Dongdong\n\n\nDemo powered by OpenSSE\n=======================\n\n* Open Sketch Search\n\nThis demo deals with 3D mesh models. See more search results, click [demo videos](http://opensse.com).\n\n![Sketch search demo](data/opensse.gif "Sketch search demo")\n\n* Open Sketch Recognize\n\nRecognize input sketch image, you can try it via [web version](http://online.opensse.com/). See more search results, click [demo videos](http://sr.opensse.com/).\n\n![Sketch recognize demo](data/opensr.gif "Sketch recognize demo")\n\n\nInteresting demo\n================\n\n*Note:* The below demos are **NOT** powered by OpenSSE, but I think they share the same field. And also I am very interested in them, so list here:\n\n- [AutoDraw](https://www.autodraw.com/)\n- [QuickDraw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/)\n\n\nHow to install\n==============\n\nAfter installed OpenSSE\'s dependency - [OpenCV 3.0.0+](http://opencv.org/), You can compile and install it like below:\n\n```sh\nmkdir release && cd release\ncmake ..\nmake\nmake install\n```\n\n\nOpenSSE Wiki\n============\nMore detail info, go to [OpenSSE Wiki](https://github.com/zddhub/opensse/wiki)\n\n\nTodo List\n=========\n- [ ] Recognize sketch\n- [ ] Speed up train steps\n- [ ] Support big image set\n\n\nThanks\n======\n- [Mathias Eitz](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/)\n- [Szymon Rusinkiewicz](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smr/)\n- [SHREC 2012 - 2014](http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/vug/sharp/contest/2014/Generic3D/index.html)\n- [Tilke Judd](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tjudd/)\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\n\nContact me\n==========\n\nIf you have any question or idea, please [email to me](mailto:zddhub@gmail.com).\n'
