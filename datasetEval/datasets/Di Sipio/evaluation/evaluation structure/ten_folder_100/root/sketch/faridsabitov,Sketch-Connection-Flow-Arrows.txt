We understood that most of our time we are spending on connecting and drawing arrows for our user flows and to automate that, I created this plugin. You can read full information about the plugin on [Medium](https://medium.com/@faridsabitov)\n\n![ArrowDemo](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/overview.gif)\n\n\n## Download Plugin\nThe most recent version you can find here:\n[**Download the Latest Arrows Sketch Plugin**](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-user-flows/releases)\n\n<a href="https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-user-flows/releases" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/gitDownload.png" height="41"></a> <a href="https://sketchpacks.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/install" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/sketchpacks-badge-install.png" height="41"></a> <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/sketch-plugin-connection-flow-arrows?utm_source=badge-featured&utm_medium=badge&utm_souce=badge-sketch-plugin-connection-flow-arrows" target="_blank"><img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=146742&theme=dark" alt="Sketch Plugin: Connection Flow Arrows - Generate auto-connected arrows for sitemaps and user flows | Product Hunt Embed" style="width: 250px; height: 54px;" height="41px" /></a>\n\n\n## How it works\n**Create a connection.** Select more than one layer in Sketch and click on "Plugins" \xf0\x9f\x91\x89 "Connection Arrows" \xf0\x9f\x91\x89 "Create Connection"\n\n![Create connection](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/createConnection.gif)\n\n\n**Update all connections inside\xc2\xa0artboard.** Select artboard where all the arrows are stored and click on "Plugins" \xf0\x9f\x91\x89 "Connection Arrows" \xf0\x9f\x91\x89 "Update Connection" \xf0\x9f\x91\x89 "From the Selected Artboard"\n\n![Update all connections inside\xc2\xa0artboard](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/updateConnection.gif)\n\n\n**Delete connection between two\xc2\xa0layers.** Select layers that have a connection and click on "Plugins" \xf0\x9f\x91\x89 "Connection Arrows" \xf0\x9f\x91\x89 "Delete Connection" \xf0\x9f\x91\x89 "Between Selected"\n\n![Delete connection between two\xc2\xa0layers](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/deleteConnection.gif)\n\n\n**Arrow Direction.** By the default you will have an "Auto" mode, that will draw arrows based on the position of the second layer but if you are creating userflows or sitemap, where all the arrows are pointed in one direction, you can specify it in settings\n\n![Arrow Direction](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/arrowDirection.gif)\n\n\n**Arrow Spacing.** For saving time and not moving all the layers one by one, you can pre-define spacing in settings. When you will create or update connection between two objects, it will automatically move the second layer for a specified amount of pixels \xe2\x9c\x8c\xef\xb8\x8f\n\n![Arrow Spacing](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/arrowSpacing.gif)\n\n\n**Arrow Style.** Right now you can provide an arrow style in settings. Make sure that the style that you want to specify is used on your Sketch document and it has "$arrow" text in the name. \n\n![Arrow Style](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/arrowStyle.gif)\n\n\n**Arrow Type.** You have the ability to select "Straight", "Angled" and "Curved" arrow types in settings. They are saved globally and if you update the connection, the arrow type will be taken from the arrow type that these objects had before. If you want to redraw the arrow and have the type specified in settings, please choose "Create Arrow" action \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\n\n![Arrow Type](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/arrowType.gif)\n\n\n**Auto-align.** If your second object is misaligned for less than 5px with this option turned on the plugin will auto-align the second object based on the direction. So you don\'t need to spend time aligning everything \xf0\x9f\xa4\x98\n\n![Auto-align](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/autoAlign.gif)\n\n\n## Bonus\nThis plugin allows you to provide an arrow between two objects, but for creating user flows and sitemaps you need actual objects to interact with. Don\'t worry, we got your back!\n\n#### [Download Free Interactions Library \xf0\x9f\x8e\x89](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Interactions)\n\n![Library Demo](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/libraryDemo.gif)\n\n## Join Community and Contacts\nIf you would like to suggest improvement, report a bug or just say "Hi \xf0\x9f\x91\x8b" join our community on [**Spectrum**](https://spectrum.chat/sketch-arrows)\n\nYou can write me directly via [mssg.me/farid](https://mssg.me/farid) or find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/faridsabitov/) or [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/FaridSabitov) as @faridsabitov\n\n\n## Watch tutorial on Youtube\n[![Preview](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/youtubePreview.jpg)](https://youtu.be/9z7BrknRocg)\n\n\n## With support from \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\n<a href="http://epam.design" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/raw/master/media/epamLogo.png" width="177" height="64"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
