Download the [Salesforce Sans fonts](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/tree/master/assets/fonts) from the Design System repository\n2. Install the Salesforce Sans fonts on your system\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Welcome to the Summer \'19 Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) Sketch UI Kit**\n\nThe Salesforce UX team has made optimizations with this Sketch Library so you can more efficiently create Salesforce Lightning interfaces. In the instructions below, we\xe2\x80\x99ll cover the basics and some tips for you to get started. You can still use this SLDS Component Library Sketch UI Kit just like you have in previous releases, by downloading it, but the Salesforce UX team believes these files are best used as a Sketch Library.\n\nSketch Libraries allow you to have SLDS components and patterns available from Sketch\xe2\x80\x99s symbols menu in any file you open. Sketch Libraries will automatically update your designs when the library is updated. Your designs will never be out of date if they\xe2\x80\x99re linked to this Sketch Library document.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n**How to use the SLDS Sketch UI Kits as Sketch Libraries**\n\nCopy and paste the following links, one by one, in any browser. This will subscribe your Sketch application to automatically download and install new versions of the SLDS Sketch UI Kits.\n\n1. Component Library\n   * <code>sketch://add-library?url=https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/sketch-library-rss.xml</code>\n2. Builder Patterns (optional)\n   * <code>sketch://add-library?url=https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/sketch-library-builder-rss.xml</code>\n3. Chart Patterns (optional)\n   * <code>sketch://add-library?url=https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/sketch-library-chart-rss.xml</code>\n4. Rules, Filters, and Logic Patterns (optional)\n   * <code>sketch://add-library?url=https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/sketch-library-rfl-rss.xml</code>\n5. User Engagement Patterns (optional)\n   * <code>sketch://add-library?url=https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/sketch-library-user-engagement-rss.xml</code>\n\nAlternatively, download the Sketch Libraries in this repository you\'d like to install. Open `Sketch > Preferences > Libraries` and click `Add Library...`. Select the library you\'d like to install.\n\nVerify that you\'ve successfully installed the Sketch Libraries by opening `Sketch > Preferences > Libraries`. You should see all of the libraries you installed above.\n\n![You can see all of your Sketch Libraries in Sketch > Preferences > Libraries](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1750832/41635016-3aa5d32a-73fb-11e8-97dd-41cf9e940735.png)\n<br />\n<br />\n\n**That\'s it! Now you can supercharge your designs for the Salesforce platform.**\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n## How to Structure your Sketch project\n\nThe SLDS UI Kit is optimized to mimic the code structure of a design system but within the bounds of Sketch. The main resource is the SLDS Component Library. This file is a replica of SLDS components and tokens. Also in the kit are multiple pattern files. These files inherit symbols from the SLDS Component Library then are composed to create examples for each pattern. If you\'re designing for Lightning, you\'ll always need the SLDS Component Library file. Depending on the patterns you\'re designing, you may need one or all of the pattern files.\n\nTo structure your Sketch project, create a file for your designs. Make sure that your Sketch application has the SLDS UI Kit libraries installed. Use the SLDS website as a reference as you decide which components to use. When you know which you\'ll need, insert the appropriate symbol into your Sketch file. Try not to detach symbols whenever possible. If you do, you are then out of sync when the next SLDS UI Kit updates are released. \n\n![SLDS Component Library is the base library. SLDS Pattern documents extend SLDS Component Library. Your designs can inherit any of the SLDS Sketch Library symbols!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1750832/41634584-3e97204e-73f9-11e8-97c4-77a648f38768.png?s=100)\n\n**SLDS Component Library** -> Base Library with SLDS components used in all SLDS Sketch documents\n<br />\n**SLDS Pattern - Builder** -> Extends SLDS Component Library and composes components for <a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/guidelines/builder/" target="_blank" title="Salesforce builders">Salesforce builder</a> patterns\n<br />\n**SLDS Pattern - Chart** -> Extends SLDS Component Library and composes components for charts patterns\n<br />\n**SLDS Pattern - Rules, Filters, and Logic** -> Extends SLDS Component Library and composes components for rules, filters, and logic patterns\n<br />\n**SLDS Pattern - User Engagement** -> Extends SLDS Component Library and composes components for <a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/guidelines/user-engagement/overview/" target="_blank" title="Salesforce builders">user engagement</a> patterns\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n## Learn More\n\n**Artboard Navigation**\n\nIn the primary SLDS Component Library Sketch file, all components have their own artboards. Finding the component symbol you want to use a breeze since the lightningdesignsystem.com website menu is mapped to the Sketch artboard list.\n\n![lightingdesignsystem.com Menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1750832/41117594-58d53dbc-6a42-11e8-82d9-7b188bbd2f74.png)\n![SLDS Component Library Artboards](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1750832/41117593-58b16270-6a42-11e8-9585-372732bfe673.png)\n<br />\n<br />\n\n**Nested Symbols**\n\nSketch symbols allow you to use and reuse a self-contained design element across a Sketch document. Any changes made to a symbol will update across your whole document. It\xe2\x80\x99s really handy! Nested symbols allow for even more customization, without breaking the symbol from its source, by adding symbols inside other symbols. These nested symbols are used throughout the Sketch file so that you can customize designs as much as possible without detaching the symbol.\n\n![The right side overrides setion in Sketch allows for tab title and state to be customized](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1750832/41117591-587bdd58-6a42-11e8-8213-0b0c84f7eb21.png)\n![The tab symbol uses nested symbols for Hover, Default and Selected states](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1750832/41117592-58941256-6a42-11e8-9be7-d9a8bbe9b339.png)\n<br />\n<br />\n\n**Tokens as Layer and Typography Styles**\n\nSalesforce Lightning Design System uses tokens to store visual design attributes. The SLDS Component Library uses Sketch Layer Styles and Sketch Text Styles to mimic [Lightning Design System design tokens](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/). This allows Sketch designs to use the equivalent of a design token; saving you time spec\'ing your designs for development.\n\nIn symbols that contain solid color backgrounds, like icons, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find the background is a layer style. This allows us to easily make file-wide changes to colors when new visual styles are introduced in SLDS. Instead of changing fill colors individually in hundreds of shapes in this document, we can just update a color symbol or point the shape to another color symbol.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n**How to use Icon Symbols**\n\nAcross Salesforce, you\'ll frequently see [Lightning Design System icons](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/). We\xe2\x80\x99ve constructed them to be easily used individually and as nested symbols. The steps below cover how to place icon symbols individually by using the SLDS Component Library as a Sketch Library\n\n1. **Choose an icon type**. SLDS has four types of icons. Utility icons are used for everything except Salesforce object icons. Utility icons are what you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to use 95% of the time. Action icons are primarily used in mobile applications. Custom icons are to be used for custom Salesforce objects. Standard icons are used for standard Salesforce objects. \n2. **Place your icon type symbol**. Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen the type of icon you\xe2\x80\x99d like to use (Utility, right?) place that symbol where you\xe2\x80\x99d like in your Sketch document.\n3. **Choose your icon glyph**. In Sketch\xe2\x80\x99s right overrides panel, choose the icon glyph you\xe2\x80\x99d like to use from the dropdown menu.\n4. **(Optional) Choose an icon glyph color**. In Sketch\xe2\x80\x99s right overrides panel, choose the icon glyph color you\xe2\x80\x99d like to use from the dropdown menu.\n5. **(Optional, for Action, Custom and Standard Icon Types) Choose an icon background color**. In Sketch\xe2\x80\x99s right overrides panel, choose the icon background color you\xe2\x80\x99d like to use from the dropdown menu.\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n## Templates\n\nSalesforce regularly checks the viewport dimensions customers use in order to optimize designs for those sizes and devices.
