b'# Copy Framer Code plugin for Sketch\n[![Download from Sketchpacks.com](https://badges.sketchpacks.com/plugins/com.gilesperry.copy-framer-code/version.svg)](https://api.sketchpacks.com/v1/plugins/com.gilesperry.copy-framer-code/download) [![Compatible Sketch Version](https://badges.sketchpacks.com/plugins/com.gilesperry.copy-framer-code/compatibility.svg)](https://sketchpacks.com/perrysmotors/copy-framer-code)\n\nA Sketch plugin that copies selected layers to the clipboard as code that can be pasted straight into a Framer prototype.\n\n- Copy one or more layers, or an entire artboard\n- Layers are copied in position\n- Rectangles, circles and text layers are drawn entirely in code*\n- Export @ 1x, @ 2x or @ 3x\n\n*If a layer is too complex to draw using code alone you can make the plugin copy the code needed to include an image asset for the layer, but you will need to drag the image files into the project manually.\n\n## New in Version 3\n- **Copy exported image assets**\n\n## Features\n- **Support for Nested Layers**: Copy Framer Code exports all nested layers inside any selected groups, adding the `parent` property to the sublayers.\n- **Export artboards**: Select an artboard to copy all of its contents.\n- **Flatten groups** to a single layer by adding `*` to the end of the layer\xe2\x80\x99s name.\n- **Hidden layers** are not imported.\n\n## Install\nDownload or clone the repository, and double click `CopyFramerCode.sketchplugin`.\n\nor...\n\n[![Install Copy Framer Code with Sketchpacks](http://sketchpacks-com.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/badges/sketchpacks-badge-install.png "Install Copy Framer Code with Sketchpacks")](https://sketchpacks.com/perrysmotors/copy-framer-code/install)\n\n## Usage\n\nSketch Import in Framer Studio creates layers in your Framer project by exporting image assets from your Sketch file. It\xe2\x80\x99s quick and easy, but it has some limitations. While you can control opacity and scale in your prototype, properties such as colour, border radius and thickness, shadows and text values are not accessible.\n\nThis plugin takes a different approach. It aims to recreate as much of your design as possible using native Framer code so you have complete control.\n\nAll it does is copy code to the clipboard. Here\xe2\x80\x99s how to use it:\n\n1. Select the layers or artboard in Sketch you want to copy.\n2. If you want to export from Sketch @ 1x, select `Copy Framer Code > Copy @ 1x` from the Plugins menu. Select `Copy Framer Code > Copy @ 2x` to double the scale of your design, and `Copy Framer Code > Copy @ 3x` to scale up by three.\n3. Paste the CoffeeScript code into Framer.\n\n![copytoframer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12557727/25869296/bf5e85f6-34f7-11e7-92c4-508deec4f76e.gif)\n\n## What layer types can the plugin handle?\n\n### Rectangles\nHere is an example of the code that will be generated when you select a rectangle showing the full set of properties that can be generated:\n```\nrectangle = new Layer\n\tx: 276\n\ty: 40\n\twidth: 200\n\theight: 100\n\tbackgroundColor: "rgba(243,244,250,1)"\n\tborderRadius: 8\n\tborderColor: "rgba(183,190,208,1)"\n\tborderWidth: 2\n\tshadowColor: "rgba(0,0,0,0.25)"\n\tshadowX: 0\n\tshadowY: 4\n\tshadowBlur: 8\n\tshadowSpread: 0\n\topacity: 0.9\n```\n\n### Circles\nCircles are created by setting the border radius of the layer to half its width:\n```\ncircle = new Layer\n\tx: 312\n\ty: 220\n\twidth: 128\n\theight: 128\n\tbackgroundColor: "rgba(243,244,250,1)"\n\tborderRadius: 64\n\tborderColor: "rgba(183,190,208,1)"\n\tborderWidth: 2\n\tshadowColor: "rgba(0,0,0,0.25)"\n\tshadowX: 0\n\tshadowY: 4\n\tshadowBlur: 8\n\tshadowSpread: 0\n\topacity: 0.9\n\n```\n\n### Text\nText is copied as a native text layer:\n```\ntext = new TextLayer\n\tx: 218\n\ty: 432\n\ttext: "Type something"\n\tfontSize: 38\n\tfontFamily: "Gotham SSm"\n\tfontWeight: 500\n\tletterSpacing: -0.4\n\tlineHeight: 2\n\ttextAlign: "center"\n\ttextDecoration: "underline"\n\ttextTransform: "uppercase"\n\tcolor: "rgba(75,79,96,1)"\n\tshadowColor: "rgba(0,0,0,0.25)"\n\tshadowX: 0\n\tshadowY: 4\n\tshadowBlur: 8\n\topacity: 0.9\n```\n\n### Groups\nGroups are copied along with any child layers:\n```\ngroup = new Layer\n\tx: 328\n\ty: 572\n\tbackgroundColor: "transparent"\n\twidth: 96\n\theight: 40\n\nsublayer2 = new Layer\n\tparent: group\n\tx: 0\n\ty: 0\n\twidth: 40\n\theight: 40\n\tbackgroundColor: "rgba(216,216,216,1)"\n\nsublayer1 = new Layer\n\tparent: group\n\tx: 56\n\ty: 0\n\twidth: 40\n\theight: 40\n\tbackgroundColor: "rgba(216,216,216,1)"\n```\nYou can stop the plugin from copying child layers by adding `*` to the end of the layer\xe2\x80\x99s name in Sketch.\n\n### Artboards\nYou can select an artboard to copy all of its contents. The plugin creates a layer for the artboard itself so that you can use the screen in a flow component:  \n\n```\nartboard = new Layer\n\tx: 0\n\ty: 0\n\tbackgroundColor: "transparent"\n\twidth: 750\n\theight: 1334\n```\n\nMake sure there are no export settings set for the artboard.\n\n### Symbols\n**The plugin cannot export the contents of symbols**. Only position, size and opacity are copied. If you want the plugin to export and any layers inside a symbol you will first need to detach the symbol:\n\n```\nsymbol = new Layer\n\tx: 248\n\ty: 668\n\twidth: 254\n\theight: 96\n\topacity: 0.9\n```\n\n### Slices\nSlices are ignored.\n\n### Everything else\nOvals, combined shapes, paths, images etc. are all created as layers with position and size only.\n\n```\ncombinedShape = new Layer\n\tx: 272\n\ty: 844\n\twidth: 206\n\theight: 136\n```\n\n## What layer styles can the plugin handle?\n- Fill\n- Border\n- Drop shadow\n- Corner radius\n- Layer opacity\n- Font size, family and weight\n- Line height\n- Character spacing\n\nA Sketch layer can have multiple fills, borders and shadows. This is not possible in Framer. When a layer has more than one of any of these style, only the top-most style is copied.\n*Outside* and *centre* borders are converted to *inside* borders as this is all that Framer can handle.\n\n## How include image assets\nWhen the design of a layer cannot be represented using native code you will need to use an image asset:  \n\n```\ncombinedShape = new Layer\n\tx: 272\n\ty: 844\n\twidth: 206\n\theight: 136\n\timage: "images/Combined Shape.svg"\n```\n\n**Here\xe2\x80\x99s how**:\n\n1. Select the layer in Sketch and click *Make exportable*.\n\nThis tells the plugin to include a reference to the image in the code it generates. If you have set multiple export settings, the plugin will try to choose an export format that matches the scale you are exporting at. Failing that it will use the first in the list. Adding export settings to rectangles, circles and text layers has no effect as it is assumed these will be drawn using native code.\n\n2. Click the export button and export the image to the images folder in your Framer project.\n\n**Making rectangles, circles or text exportable has no effect because it is assumed these types of layer will be created using code alone.**\n\n---\n\n**If you are using this plugin, please \'star\' this project**. It\'s a simple way to help me see how many people are using it.\n\nIf you ***love*** this plugin, why not shout me a coffee \xe2\x98\x95\xef\xb8\x8f via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/perrysmotors/5) to share the love!\n\n<a href="https://www.paypal.me/perrysmotors/5">\n  <img width="160" height="41" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12557727/39295119-7e115bca-4935-11e8-9fe9-802d667ac22c.png" >\n</a>\n'
