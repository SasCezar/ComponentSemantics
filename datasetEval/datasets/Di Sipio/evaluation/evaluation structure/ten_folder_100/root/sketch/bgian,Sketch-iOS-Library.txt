b'# Sketch iOS Library\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to take styles from Xcode and do my best to replicate them for Sketch. Along the way, I documented the process of how I ended up with the result so you can look into things even further.\n\nYou\'ll need to download Apple\'s SF font: https://developer.apple.com/fonts/\n\n## UIBlurEffectStyle\nThe API doesn\'t provide any specs for blurs, so it\'s a challenge to replicate. For performance concerns, I understand why Apple isn\'t open about these specs. However, as designers I think we shuold be aware of these constraints and design with them.\n\n#### Usage\n1. Open [`UIBlurEffectStyle.sketch`](https://github.com/bgian/Sketch-iOS-Library/blob/master/UIBlurEffectStyle/UIBlurEffectStyle.sketch)\n2. Copy style of a blur type\n3. Paste style to any shape\n\n#### Process\n1. Created a few colorful shapes to blur\n2. Rendered and exported all three [types of blur](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiblureffectstyle) over the shapes in Xcode:\n    - `extraLight`\n    - `light`\n    - `dark`\n3. Replicated each blur type in Sketch\n\n## UIFontTextStyle\nApple\xe2\x80\x99s system fonts are designed for legibility and provide a variety of sizes which automatically react to accessibility features. You can read more about why it\xe2\x80\x99s best to use system fonts on the [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/typography/).\n\n#### Usage\n1. Open [`UIFontTextStyle.sketch`](https://github.com/bgian/Sketch-iOS-Library/blob/master/UIFontTextStyle/UIFontTextStyle.sketch)\n2. Copy & Paste artboard into Sketch document\n3. Assign texts to a system style\n\n#### Process\n1. Made a list of all ten text styles:\n    - `Title1`\n    - `Title2`\n    - `Title3`\n    - `Headline`\n    - `Subhead`\n    - `Body`\n    - `Footnote`\n    - `Caption1`\n    - `Caption2`\n    - `Callout`\n2. Printed out the specs in Xcode (e.g. `UIFontTextStyle(_rawValue: UICTFontTextStyleTitle1): .SFUIDisplay-Light, 28`)\n3. Used font tracking [designcode.io](https://designcode.io/cloud/chapter1/iOS-Tracking.jpg) recommends\n\n## Get Involved\n\n#### Suggest a style\n1. Create a [new issue](https://github.com/bgian/Sketch-iOS-Library/issues/new)\n2. Describe the iOS style that should be replicated\n3. \xe2\x9c\xa8 Bonus: Follow the issue to provide feedback\n\n#### Leave feedback\n1. Create a [new issue](https://github.com/bgian/Sketch-iOS-Library/issues/new)\n2.
