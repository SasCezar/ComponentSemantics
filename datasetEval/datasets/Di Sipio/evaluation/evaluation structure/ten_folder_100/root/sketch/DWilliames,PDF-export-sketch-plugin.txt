This is extremely helpful for things such as \'images with fills\', \'gradient fills\', \'some shadows\' that sometimes don\'t render well into a PDF.*You can also specify the export size for the PNGs \xe2\x80\x94 same as the typical Sketch export; `200w` = width of 200px, `100h` = height of 100px, `3x` = 3 times artboard size* |\n| **Ignore Artboards/pages with prefix** | Do you sometimes have those few artboards you still want to keep around, but don\'t necessarily want to export? Or maybe a page that is an archive? Then this is perfect for you. When checked, you can specify a prefix. Every artboard or page with that prefix will be excluded when exporting. |\n| **Include \'Symbol Master\' Artboards** | Perhaps you use Symbols and wish to include the \'Symbol Master\' artboards in your export... now you can. |\n\n\n## Why make this plugin?\n\nToo often, I found myself going \'File > Export Artboards to PDF\', then opening up the PDF and deleting pages I didn\'t actually want.\n\nSometimes I would duplicate a page in Sketch as a new iteration on the design. I would then want to export the single iteration\xe2\x80\x94consisting of multiple artboards\xe2\x80\x94into a PDF for distribution and printing purposes; so having a \'Export current page into PDF\' option is a real lifesaver!! \xf0\x9f\x98\x8d\n\n\n## Installation\n\n1.
