b'# html-sketchapp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/html-sketchapp/html-sketchapp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/html-sketchapp/html-sketchapp) [![npm version](https://badgen.now.sh/npm/v/@brainly/html-sketchapp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brainly/html-sketchapp) [![MIT license](https://badgen.now.sh/badge/license/MIT/blue)](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp/blob/master/LICENSE.md) [![npm downloads](https://badgen.now.sh/npm/dm/@brainly/html-sketchapp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brainly/html-sketchapp)\n\nHTML to Sketch export solution.\n\n<div align="center">\n  <img alt="html-sketchapp" src="https://i.imgur.com/TeMMW8b.png" height="200" />\n</div>\n\n## What it can do?\n\nhtml-sketchapp turns HTML nodes into Sketch layers or symbols. Additionally, it allows to export shared text styles and document colors.\n\n<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yPjMwFU.png" width="100%" />\n\n## Why?\n\nThe motivation behind this project was ability to easily share Front-End style guide with our Design team. Although similar project, [react-sketchapp](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp), already exists it does require you to:\n\n- use React,\n- build everything using generic components (`<View>`, `<Text>`, `<Image>`),\n- and keep your styles in JS.\n\nWe were unable to quickly work around these limitations, so we created html-sketchapp.\n\nYou can learn more about this project from:\n- [our wiki](https://github.com/html-sketchapp/html-sketchapp/wiki),\n- and the excellent article ["Sketching in the Browser"](https://medium.com/seek-blog/sketching-in-the-browser-33a7b7aa0526) by @markdalgleish.\n\n## Limitations\n\nComprehensive summary of what is, and what is not supported can be found [here](https://github.com/html-sketchapp/html-sketchapp/wiki/What\'s-supported%3F), but the TLDR is as follows:\n\n- pseudoelements are not supported,\n- some CSS properties (e.g. overflow) are not supported or not fully supported,\n- not all types of images are supported (animated gifs, webp),\n- resizing information is not generated,\n- all fonts have to be locally installed.\n\nThe good news is that all of those are fixable and that we welcome pull requests \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\n\n## How do I run it?\n\n### Install html-sketchapp\n\nYou can get stable version of html-sketchapp from NPM.\n\n```sh\nnpm i @brainly/html-sketchapp\n```\n\n### Create .asketch files\n\n`html2asketch` is a library that you can use to create a script that extracts specific parts of your website and saves them as layers, shared text styles, document colors and symbols. Your script then can be run in a regular or a headless browser.\n\nThere is no one right way of using `html2asketch`, but you can start by checking out the ["Usage Examples"](https://github.com/html-sketchapp/html-sketchapp/wiki/Usage-Examples) section of the wiki or the two example projects that we provide:\n\n- [html-sketchapp-example](https://github.com/html-sketchapp/html-sketchapp-example) - minimal script that takes an URL and produces a `page.asketch.json` file\n- [html-sketchapp-style-guide](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp-style-guide) - script that takes parts of the Brainly style-guide and exports them as Sketch symbols, shared text styles and document colors. This script produces `document.asketch.json` and `page.asketch.json`.\n\n*If you are wondering what are, and why we need `.asketch` files, plese see our [wiki](https://github.com/html-sketchapp/html-sketchapp/wiki/How-does-it-work%3F).*\n\n### Import .asketch files to Sketch\n\nAll `.asketch.json` files should be loaded to Sketch via the `asketch2sketch.sketchplugin` plugin.\n\n<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9eDm6NQ.png" width="450" alt="Installing Sketch plugin" title="Installing Sketch plugin" />\n\nYou can download ready to use Sketch plugin from the ["Releases"](https://github.com/html-sketchapp/html-sketchapp/releases/latest) section, or build it yourself from the sources:\n\n```\nnpm i # install dependencies\nnpm run build # build the plugin\n```\n\n## Projects using html-sketchapp\n\n- [html-sketchapp-cli](https://github.com/seek-oss/html-sketchapp-cli) - "Quickly generate Sketch libraries from HTML documents and living style guides."\n- [story2sketch](https://github.com/chrisvxd/story2sketch) - "Convert Storybook stories into Sketch symbols."\n- [UIengine](https://github.com/dennisreimann/uiengine) - "Workbench for UI-driven development."\n- [Alva](https://github.com/meetalva/alva) - "Alva is a radically new design tool that enables cross-functional teams to design digital products"\n- [FAST-DNA](https://github.com/Microsoft/fast-dna) - "A set of tooling, resources, and components used to accelerate building Web sites and applications."\n\n## Standing on the shoulders of giants :heart:\n\nThis project uses huge bits and pieces from the fantastic [react-sketchapp](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp) and wouldn\'t be possible without [skpm](https://github.com/skpm/skpm) and information from [Sketch-Headers](https://github.com/abynim/Sketch-Headers).\n'
