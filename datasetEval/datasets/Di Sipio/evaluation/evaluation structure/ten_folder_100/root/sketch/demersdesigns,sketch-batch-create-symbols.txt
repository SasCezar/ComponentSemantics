Multiple\nselections will be merged into one symbol.\n\nThis plug-in will create a symbol for every item that is currently selected.\nThis is really handy when you need to convert a bunch of layers to symbols.\n\n# Usage\nSelect the shapes, layers, images, or groups that you want to convert into symbols. Then from the Plugins menu,\nchoose \'Batch Create Symbols\' and pick from one of the three options.\n\n**Use Layer Names** will create symbols and use the existing layer names.\n\n**Use Custom Names** option will allow you to add your own name that the newly created symbols will use.\n\nThis works by taking the name you enter into the input and adding a number after it for each symbol to be created.\n\nFor example, if you have three layers, and you enter \'portfolio\' as the custom name, each symbol will be named portfolio-1, portfolio-2, and portfolio-3.\n\n**Use Custom Folders** allows you to create symbols within a folder structure.\n\nIf you select a layer or multiple layers and choose Custom Folders, you can enter in a series of names separated by slashes to create a series of nested folders in the insert symbols menu.\n\nFor example, entering iOS/3x/assets/ would create iOS>3x>assets>symbol-names.\n\n**Please note: you must have a trailing slash at the end of your folder structure for this to work properly.**\n\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demersdesigns/sketch-batch-create-symbols/gh-pages/demo.gif" />\n\n# Manual Installation\n1.
