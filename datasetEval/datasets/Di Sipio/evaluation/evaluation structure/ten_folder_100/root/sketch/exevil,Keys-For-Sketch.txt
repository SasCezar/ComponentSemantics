b'## Attention! Plugin Support Has Been Discontinued\nSince I don\'t have much time for further plugin developement and new Sketch releases produce bugs pretty often I decided to discontinue the project support. Sorry.\n\nUpdate: All sources are now available in this repo. Enjoy!\n\n---\n\n![](./Assets/img_cover.png)\n\n<br />\n<img src="https://d26dzxoao6i3hh.cloudfront.net/items/0z1f0k2Y0T182m343E1M/Group%202.svg" width="90" align="left">\n\n# Keys For Sketch\n\n<br />\nKeys is a full-featured shortcut manager for Sketch.

What should I do?\nThe only you can do is check [the issues list](https://github.com/exevil/Keys-For-Sketch/issues) and report your issue if no-one did it before. Right now Keys supports only the latest stable Sketch version, so you should expect an update right after its release.\n\n#### \xe2\x80\x94 Where can I see the changelog?\nOn the [Releases](https://github.com/exevil/Keys-For-Sketch/releases) page.\n\n#### \xe2\x80\x94 How to restore default Sketch shortcuts?\nUse \xc2\xabRestore Default Shortcuts...\xc2\xbb command from plugin menu. *It should remove any user shortcut data includinge one that defined directly in System Preferences.*\n\n#### \xe2\x80\x94 How Keys will affect custom shortcuts I defined earlier in System Preferences?\nSince Keys is using default system storage for shortcuts it shouldn\'t affect previously set shortcuts without additional user actions like \xc2\xabRestore Default Shortcuts...\xc2\xbb command from plugin menu.\n\n#### \xe2\x80\x94 Can\'t see my Keys shortcuts in System Preferences. Is it something wrong?\nSince System Preferences caches shortcut values from storage once upon a startup you need to completely relaunch it to get updated shortcut data there.\n\n#### \xe2\x80\x94 What happens with my custom shortcuts if I remove Keys?\nNothing, because all your shortcuts were defined in System Preferences.\n\n#### \xe2\x80\x94 I removed Keys and my custom shortcuts manually from System Preferences, but tools with single-character shortcuts (like Pencil or Vector) are still using previously defined values. How to reset it to defaults too?\nSince Sketch manages single character shortcuts by itself, you should delete `keyBindings.plist` from `~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/` folder and restart Sketch to return default tools shortcuts.\n\n#### \xe2\x80\x94 Some menu items aren\'t shown in Keys. How to fix?\nInternally Sketch may not properly draw some menu items prior to their first appearance in menu, that\'s why the only way to make these kind of menu items configurable with Keys is to manually access it through the app menu first.\n\n#### \xe2\x80\x94 Keys conflicts with other plugins that using earlier Swift versions. Is there any way to fix it?\nUnfortunately, there isn\'t. In simple terms, there\'s no capability between different Swift versions right now so it may produce an errors at runtime.\n\nBut it\'s not really a big deal. Firstly, the Swift team has already announced that ABI capability feature is planned for the next major Swift release and this is the first priority right now. Secondly, plugins can\'t conflict each other while the latest available Swift version is used for all of them and requesting author for an update may be a good temporary solution for this problem.\n\n#### \xe2\x80\x94 Why I can\'t remove default shortcut from a menu item?\nSince Keys plugin is wrapping a default System Preferences shortcut assignment flow it follows the same rules. So any default shortcut are constant until you either replace it with your own or use the same combination for another menu item.\n\n#### \xe2\x80\x94 Why it\'s not possible to assign a single-character shortcut to menu item other than specific items under the insert menu?\nSince Sketch itself is using an internal predefined list of menu items that allowed a single-character shortcut to be set, Keys can customize single-character shortcuts only for these items.\n\n#### \xe2\x80\x94 My issue isn\'t listed here. What now?\nPlease check the [open issues list](https://github.com/exevil/Keys-For-Sketch/issues) and feel free to create a new one if you don\'t see your problem there.\n\n## Support Project\nI spent a lot of time to make this project real so any feedback or donation is really matters.
