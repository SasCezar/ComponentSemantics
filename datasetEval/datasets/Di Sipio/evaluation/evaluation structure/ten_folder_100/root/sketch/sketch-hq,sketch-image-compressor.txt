b'# Image Compressor\n\nA Plugin for Sketch that compresses your exported bitmap assets, to keep filesize to a minimum. This Plugin requires Sketch 3.8.\n\nPlease note that the compression is lossless, so **no pixels will be harmed by running this Plugin** : )\n\n## Installation\n\n- Download [Sketch Image Compressor](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/sketch-image-compressor/files/1439529/sketch.image.compressor.sketchplugin.zip) & unzip it.\n- Double click **Sketch Image Compressor.sketchplugin** to install the Plugin.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Plugin uses two methods for asset compression:\n\n- **Quick Compression** happens automatically, whenever you export an asset from Sketch using the File \xe2\x80\xba Export\xe2\x80\xa6 menu option or the Export button in the toolbar. The Plugin will run your PNG & JPG assets through [`optipng`](http://optipng.sourceforge.net) and [`jpegoptim`](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim) using the quickest settings for both, so that you get smaller files as fast as possible.\n- **Full Compression** happens when you choose the Plugins \xe2\x80\xba Sketch Image Compressor \xe2\x80\xba Export All Assets menu option. You\'ll be asked for a path where your assets will be exported, and then the Plugin will export *every exportable layer* from your document, and run the assets through [`advpng`](https://github.com/amadvance/advancecomp), [`optipng`](http://optipng.sourceforge.net), [`pngcrush`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pmt/files/), [`zopflipng`](https://github.com/google/zopfli), [`jpegtran`](http://www.infai.org/jpeg/) and [`jpegoptim`](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), using more aggressive settings than the Quick Compression (i.e: the operation will be **extremely slow**)\n\nPlease note that both methods won\'t block Sketch\'s UI when running, so you\'ll be able to keep on working while the compressors run. *However*, running a Full Compression on a non-trivial document will most likely consume a lot of CPU for a long time, so don\'t expect Sketch to be as snappy as usual : )\n\nYou\'ll get some feedback about the process in the Sketch window while it\'s running, and some stats when it is done.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- Thank you [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com) for the inspiration. If you\'re looking for more fine-grained control of your compression settings, or a way to do lossy compression, it doesn\'t get any better than this.\n- Thanks to the following projects:\n  - [advpng](https://github.com/amadvance/advancecomp)\n  - [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim)\n  - [jpegtran](http://www.infai.org/jpeg/)\n  - [optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net)\n  - [pngcrush](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pmt/files/)\n  - [zopflipng](https://github.com/google/zopfli)\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Bohemian Coding\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
