b'# Sketch Styles Generator\n\n![Sketch Styles Generator](images/img-header.jpg)\n\n> Programmatically generate hundreds Shared Styles, all at once\n\n**Sketch Styles Generator** is a plugin made for [Sketch](http://sketchapp.com).\n\nYou can select any amount of layers (text, shapes, or both) and generate Shared Styles for all of them, at once. The Shared Styles are named like the layers. Take a look at the [usage](#usage) section to know more about how to use it.\n\nFollow me on Twitter [@lucaorio\\_](https://twitter.com/lucaorio_) for updates, help and other stuff! \xf0\x9f\x8e\x89\n\n_Looking for other plugins?

You can check the Sketch\'s native _Select Group\'s Content on Click_ feature and refine your selection.\n\n#### Can I use other groups/artboards/pages to generate the names?\n\nNo. This is an intentional choice to keep the scope of the plugin as narrow as possible, simplify its maintenance, and avoid duplication of features already available in other plugins.\n\n#### How does this plugin manage updates, and already existing styles?\n\nBelow is a quick overview of how the plugin works behind the scenes. Please note that this is a generator, _not_ a manager. \xf0\x9f\x98\x9c\n\n`The layer has no shared style applied, and no existing shared style matches its name`: **Create a new shared style**\n\n`The layer has no shared style applied, but there\'s a shared style that shares its name`: **Apply the shared style to the layer**\n\n`The layer has a shared style applied, and its synced, but there\'s a mismatch between the names`: **The shared style is renamed to match the layer**\n\n`The layer was changed, and is now out-of-sync with the shared style applied to it`: **The shared style, and all its instances are synced**\n\n`The layer was changed in both its appereance, and name, but still connected to a shared style`: **The shared style, and all its instances are synced and renamed**\n\n## Integrations\n\n_Sketch Styles Generator_ is now fully integrated with [Sketch Runner](http://bit.ly/SketchRunnerWebsite), the ultimate tool to speed up your Sketch workflow. You can trigger the plugin by simply typing its name.\n\n![Sketch Runner Integration](images/img-sketch-runner.jpg)\n\n<a href="http://bit.ly/SketchRunnerWebsite">\n  <img width="160" height="40" src="http://sketchrunner.com/img/badge_blue.png">\n</a>\n\n<a href="https://sketchpacks.com/lucaorio/sketch-styles-generator/install">\n  <img width="160" height="41" src="http://sketchpacks-com.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/badges/sketchpacks-badge-install.png" >\n</a>\n\n## License\n\n![https://github.com/lucaorio/sketch-styles-generator/blob/master/license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)\n\n---\n\n## Contacts\n\n- \xf0\x9f\x90\xa6 Twitter [@lucaorio\\_](http://twitter.com/@lucaorio_)\n- \xf0\x9f\x95\xb8 Website [lucaorio.com](http://lucaorio.com)\n- \xf0\x9f\x93\xac Email [luca.o@me.com](mailto:luca.o@me.com)\n'
