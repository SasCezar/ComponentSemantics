b'\nC Algorithms\n\nThe C programming language includes a very limited standard library in\ncomparison to other modern programming languages.  This is a collection of\ncommon Computer Science algorithms which may be used in C projects.\n\nThe code is licensed under the ISC license (a simplified version of the BSD\nlicense that is functionally identical).  As such, it may legitimately be\nreused in any project, whether Proprietary or Open Source.\n\n'
