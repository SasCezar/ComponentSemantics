b'# LeetCode-Sol-Res\n\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/FreeTymeKiyan/LeetCode-Sol-Res](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/FreeTymeKiyan/LeetCode-Sol-Res?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n  \nThis repository contains solutions and resources for [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com) algorithm problems.  \n\nThe solutions are derived from my own thinking and the discussion. They are cleaned and optimized carefully, thus more readable and understandable!  \n\nAn excel table for quick review before interview is also provided in resources directory.  \n\nAlso want to access all codes on your Android phone? Get APAS from [GooglePlay here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freetymekiyan.apas)!\n  \n## Features  \n\n### Readable Solutions\n\n* Level Categorization: Easy, Middle and Hard.\n* Problem Description and Tags on Top.  \n* Clear Solution Explanation.  \n* In-line Comment for Key Points.  \n* Different Solutions for Comparison.\n* Test cases to help prove correctness.  \n* Importable and compilable with IntelliJ.  \n  \n### Solutions Table for Quick Review\n\nA table for all problems.

New Problems in Book(156 ~ 159, 161, 163, 167, 170, 186)\n4. Tips\n5. Other Classic Problems\n  \nEach problem row has name, level, idea, code and frequency analysis.  \n\n* Frequency: derived from online resources and interview experience.  \n* Idea: the description of the general idea of the solution.  \n* Code: key steps in implementation.  \n* Tips: summary of tricks and tips appeared in solutions.  \n* New Problems: put into a single page because frequency is unknown.  \n  \nImportant and hard problems have **bold title** and key points are **marked red**.   \n  \n### Other Problems\n  \nLeetCode problems are not always enough. Some other popular or classic algorithm problems that worth taking a look are put in "src/main/java/com/freetymekiyan/algorithms/other/" directory for your reference.  \n  \n## Resources  \n  \nCurrent resources are as followed:   \n\n1. Problems list of Clean Code Handbook published by LeetCode.  \n2. An .xlsx file for frequency and solutions.  \n  \n## Todo\n  \n1. Time and Space efficiency analysis.  \n2. Add new problems.  \n3. Add more resources.  \n  \n## References  \n\n1.
