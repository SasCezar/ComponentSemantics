It was written in Simplified Chinese but other languages such as English and Traditional Chinese are also working in progress. Contributions are welcome!\n\n- [English](https://algorithm.yuanbin.me/en/), rarely updated\n- [\xe7\xae\x80\xe4\xbd\x93\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87](https://algorithm.yuanbin.me/zh-hans/), frequently updated\n- [\xe7\xb9\x81\xe9\xab\x94\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87](https://algorithm.yuanbin.me/zh-tw/), rarely updated\n\n## Introduction\n\n1. Part I is some brief introduction of basic data structures and algorithm, such as linked lists, stack, queues, trees, sorting.\n2. Part II is the analysis and summary of programming problems, and most of the programming problems come from <https://leetcode.com/>, <http://www.lintcode.com/>, <http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/>, <http://hihocoder.com/>, <https://www.topcoder.com/>.\n3. Part III is the appendix of resume and other supplements.\n\nThis project is hosted on <https://github.com/billryan/algorithm-exercise> and rendered by [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/yuanbin/algorithm/details).
