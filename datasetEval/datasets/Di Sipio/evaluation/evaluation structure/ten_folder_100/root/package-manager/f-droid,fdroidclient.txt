b'# F-Droid Client\n\n[![build status](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/builds)\n[![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/f-droid/-/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/f-droid/)\n\nClient for [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org), the Free Software repository system\nfor Android.\n\n## Building with Gradle\n\n    ./gradlew assembleRelease\n\n## Direct download\n\nYou can [download the application](https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk) directly\nfrom our site or [browse it in the repo](https://f-droid.org/app/org.fdroid.fdroid).\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee our [Contributing doc](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to report\nissues, translate the app into your language or help with development.\n\n## IRC\n\nWe are on `#fdroid` and `#fdroid-dev` on Freenode. We hold weekly dev meetings\non `#fdroid-dev` on Thursdays at 11:30h UTC, which usually last half an hour.\n\n## FAQ\n\n* Why does F-Droid require "Unknown Sources" to install apps by default?\n\nBecause a regular Android app cannot act as a package manager on its\nown. To do so, it would require system privileges (see below), similar\nto what Google Play does.\n\n* Can I avoid enabling "Unknown Sources" by installing F-Droid as a\n  privileged system app?\n\nThis used to be the case, but no longer is. Now the [Privileged\nExtension](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/privileged-extension) is the one that should be placed in\nthe system. It can be bundled with a ROM or installed via a zip.\n## License\n\nThis program is Free Software: You can use, study share and improve it at your\nwill.
