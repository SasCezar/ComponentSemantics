b"# Kasane\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/kasane/master/logo.png)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/kasane.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/kasane) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/google/kasane/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/google/kasane?branch=master)\n\nkasane [ \xe9\x87\x8d\xe3\x81\xad ] (n.) pile; heap; layers\n\n**This is not an official Google product**\n\nKasane is a layering tool for kubernetes. It allows you to use the officially published YAML documents and extend them further with your local configuration.\n\nKasane can utilise Jsonnet for deep object modification and patching.\n\n## Installation\n\nKasane requires Python 3+. Install via pip:\n\n```shell\npip install kasane\n```\n\nInstallation via Homebrew:\n\n```shell\nbrew tap google/kasane https://github.com/google/kasane.git\nbrew install google/kasane/kasane\n```\n\n## Running from a Docker container\n\nYou can run kasane from a docker container, the official image is `gcr.io/kasaneapp/kasane`. The image is based on alpine and comes pre-packaged with bash, curl, git and kubectl in addition to kasane itself. The workdir is set to `/app` and the default command is `kasane show` so you can quickly examine your local Kasanefiles like this:\n\n```bash\n$ docker run --rm -ti -v $PWD/examples/03-environment:/app gcr.io/kasaneapp/kasane\nconfig:\n  defaultFlag: UNRESOLVED_ENV_VAR__DEFAULT_VALUE\n  defaultFromKasanefile: value\n  jsonnetEnv: UNRESOLVED_ENV_VAR__OTHER_VALUE\nkind: VendoredObject\nmetadata:\n  name: PreconfiguredObject\n```\n\nTagged builds for versions starting with 0.1.4 are also available as e.g. `gcr.io/kasaneapp/kasane:0.1.4`.\n\n## Examples\n\n* [Simple Layers](examples/01-simple-layers) is an introduction to kasane features.\n* [Jsonnet Transformations](examples/02-jsonnet-transformations) shows how to use Jsonnet to transform objects.\n* [Environment](examples/03-environment) explains how to use the external environment for customized pipelines.\n* [Complex Service](examples/04-complex-service) shows all the features together by using the upstream configuration for kubernetes dashboard, adding an ingress, and optionally enabling istio sidecar.\n\n## Similar tools\n\n### Helm\n\nHelm is fully-featured package management solution for kubernetes. Compared to it, kasane is a swiss army knife. It's simple, lightweight, doesn't install helper code into your production. Kasane allows you to use original YAML files written by application authors, modifying them to your local needs. If you see a `kubectl apply -f http://` example you can turn it into a Kasane deployment with a single line of code and then extend it to your needs.\n\nKasane doesn't do any templating, relying on Jsonnet for data manipulation. You won't ever need to count number of spaces to make sure your yaml go template is rendered correctly.\n\n### Ksonnet\n\nKasane is similar to Ksonnet but is much simpler to use. Kasane allows to re-use original YAML files and minimizes amount of custom Jsonnet code you need to write. Most of the time your Kasane project would consist of a Kasanefile and single yaml or jsonnet file. Still, Kasane allows runtime flexibility with conditional layers and custom environment.\n\n## License\n\nKasane is distributed under Apache-2 [license](LICENSE).
