b"# Topgrade\n[![Travis](https://api.travis-ci.org/r-darwish/topgrade.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/r-darwish/topgrade)\n[![AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/r-darwish/topgrade?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/r-darwish/topgrade)\n![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/r-darwish/topgrade.svg)\n[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/topgrade.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/topgrade)\n[![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/topgrade.svg)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/topgrade/)\n![homebrew](https://img.shields.io/homebrew/v/topgrade.svg)\n\n![Alt Text](doc/screenshot.gif)\n\nKeeping your system up to date mostly involves invoking more than a single package manager. This\nusually results in big shell one-liners saved in your shell history. Topgrade tries to solve this\nproblem by detecting which tools you use and run their appropriate package managers.\n\n## Supported Platforms\nTopgrade should probably work on whichever platform it can be build. The real question is whether\nTopgrade knows that platform and can utilize its unique features, such as the operating system's\npackage manager. Topgrade is tested on and knows the following platforms:\n\n* Linux\n  * Arch based\n  * Red Hat based\n  * Debian based\n  * Clear Linux\n  * Gentoo\n  * NixOS\n  * openSUSE\n  * Void\n* DragonFly BSD\n* FreeBSD\n* macOS\n* Windows\n\n## Installation\nArch Linux users can use the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/topgrade/) package.\n\nOn NixOS, use the `topgrade` package in `nixpkgs`:\n\n```sh\nnix-env -iA topgrade\n```\n\nmacOS users can install topgrade via Homebrew.\n\nOther systems users can either use `cargo install` or use the compiled binaries from the release\npage. The compiled binaries contain a self-upgrading feature.\n\nTopgrade isn't guaranteed to work on Rust versions older than the latest stable release. If you\nintend to install Topgrade using Cargo then you should either install Rust using rustup or use a\ndistribution which ships the latest version of Rust, such as Arch Linux.\n\n### Upgrading Topgrade\nThe precompiled binaries supplied in the Github releases page are compiled with a self upgrade\nfeature. Topgrade will try to upgrade itself before attempting anything else and will respawn itself\nwhen an update is downloaded. If you choose to install Topgrade in this method it is recommended\nthat you place the binary in some place which is writable by your user account, such as\n`~/.local/bin`.\n\nIf you prefer to have Topgrade installed in system-wide manner then it's recommended to either\ninstall it using the OS package manager or `cargo install`. Topgrade will not have the self upgrade\nfeature but it will keep itself up to date by calling the operating system's package manager.\n\n## Usage\nJust run `topgrade`. It will run the following steps:\n\n* Try to self-upgrade if compiled with this feature. Topgrade will respawn itself if it was upgraded.\n* **Linux**: Run the system package manager:\n  * **Arch based**: Run [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) or fall back to pacman\n  * **Redhat based**: Run `yum upgrade` (or `dnf` if present)\n  * **Debian based**: Run `apt update && apt dist-upgrade`\n  * **Clear Linux**: Run `swupd update`\n  * **Gentoo**: Run `layman -s ALL && emerge --sync -q && eix-update && emerge -uDNa world`\n  * **openSUSE**: Run `zypper refresh && zypper dist-upgrade`\n  * **Void**: Run `xbps-install -Su`\n* **Linux**: Run [etc-update](https://dev.gentoo.org/~zmedico/portage/doc/man/etc-update.1.html):\n* **DragonFly BSD**: Upgrade and audit packages\n* **FreeBSD**: Upgrade and audit packages\n* **Unix**: Run `brew update && brew upgrade`. This should handle both Homebrew and Linuxbrew\n* **Unix**: Run `nix upgrade-nix && nix --upgrade`.\n* **Unix**: Run [Pearl](https://github.com/pearl-core/pearl) `pearl update`.\n* **Windows**: Run Topgrade inside WSL.\n* **Windows**: Upgrade Powershell modules\n* **Windows**: Upgrade all [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) packages\n* **Windows**: Upgrade all [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) packages\n* Check if the following paths are tracked by Git.

This will also attempt to run `rustup self update` when Rustup is installed inside the home directory.\n* Run Cargo [install-update](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update)\n* Upgrade Emacs packages (You'll get a better output if you have [Paradox](https://github.com/Malabarba/paradox) installed)\n* Upgrade [OCaml packages](https://opam.ocaml.org/)\n* Upgrade [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) globally installed packages\n* Upgrade [myrepos](https://myrepos.branchable.com/) managed sourcecode repositories\n* Upgrade Python packages installed using [pipx](https://github.com/cs01/pipx)\n* Upgrade [R globally installed packages](https://github.com/ankane/jetpack)\n* Upgrade [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)\n* Upgrade Vim/Neovim packages.

(View\n  only. No upgrades will actually be performed)\n* **Linux**: Run `rpi-update` to update Raspberry Pi Firmware\n* **Linux**: Run [pihole](https://pi-hole.net/) updater\n* Run custom defined commands\n* Final stage\n  * **Linux**: Run [needrestart](https://github.com/liske/needrestart)\n  * **Windows**: Run Windows Update (You'll have to install [PSWindowsUpdate](https://marckean.com/2016/06/01/use-powershell-to-install-windows-updates/))\n  * **macOS**: Upgrade App Store applications\n  * **FreeBSD**: Run `freebsd-upgrade`\n\n## Customization\nSee `config.example.toml` for an example configuration file.\n\n### Configuration path\n\nThe configuration should be placed in the following paths depending by the operating system:\n\n* **macOS** - `~/Library/Preferences/topgrade.toml`\n* **Windows** - `%APPDATA%/topgrade.toml`\n* **Other Unix systems** - `~/.config/topgrade.toml`\n\n## Remote execution\nYou can specify a key called `remote_topgrades` in the configuration file. This key should contain a\nlist of hostnames that have topgrade installed on them. Topgrade will execute Topgrades on these\nremote hosts.\n"
