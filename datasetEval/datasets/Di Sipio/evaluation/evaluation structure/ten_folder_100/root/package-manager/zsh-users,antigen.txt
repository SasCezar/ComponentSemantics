The concept is pretty much the same as bundles in a\ntypical vim+pathogen setup. Antigen is to zsh, what [Vundle][] is to vim.\n\n\n[![https://asciinema.org/a/cn20v8fy6wrhab4l5kifv6dce](https://asciinema.org/a/cn20v8fy6wrhab4l5kifv6dce.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/cn20v8fy6wrhab4l5kifv6dce)\n\n\nAntigen has reached a certain level of stability and has been used in the wild\nfor around a couple of years. If you face any problems, please open an issue.\n\nAntigen works with zsh versions `>= 4.3.11`.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall Antigen from our main repository with the latest stable version available:\n\n    curl -L git.io/antigen > antigen.zsh\n    # or use git.io/antigen-nightly for the latest version\n\nThere are several installation methods using your System Package manager, just look\nat the [Installation][] wiki page.\n\nNow you may head towards the [Commands][] and [Configuration][] wiki pages to further\nunderstand Antigen\'s functionallity and customization.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe usage should be very familiar to you if you use Vundle. A typical `.zshrc`\nmight look like this:\n\n    source /path-to-antigen/antigen.zsh\n\n    # Load the oh-my-zsh\'s library.\n    antigen use oh-my-zsh\n\n    # Bundles from the default repo (robbyrussell\'s oh-my-zsh).\n    antigen bundle git\n    antigen bundle heroku\n    antigen bundle pip\n    antigen bundle lein\n    antigen bundle command-not-found\n\n    # Syntax highlighting bundle.\n    antigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting\n\n    # Load the theme.\n    antigen theme robbyrussell\n\n    # Tell Antigen that you\'re done.\n    antigen apply\n\nOpen your zsh with this `.zshrc` and you should see all the bundles you defined\nhere, getting installed. Once it\'s done, you are ready to roll. The complete\nsyntax for the `antigen bundle` command is discussed in the [Commands][] page.\n\nFurthermore, [In the wild][wild] wiki section has more configuration examples. You may\nas well take a look at the [Show off][] wiki page\nfor interactive mode usage.\n\n## Meta\n\n### Motivation\n\nIf you use zsh and [oh-my-zsh][], you know that having many different plugins\nthat are developed by many different authors in a single (sub)repo is not very\neasy to maintain. There are some really fantastic plugins and utilities in\noh-my-zsh, but having them all in a single repo doesn\'t really scale well. And I\nadmire robbyrussell\'s efforts for reviewing and merging the gigantic number of\npull requests the project gets. We need a better way of plugin management.\n\nThis was discussed on [a][1] [few][2] [issues][3], but it doesn\'t look like\nthere was any progress made. So, I\'m trying to start this off with Antigen,\nhoping to better this situation. Please note that I\'m by no means a zsh or any\nshell script expert (far from it).\n\n[1]: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/465\n[2]: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/377\n[3]: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/1014\n\nInspired by vundle, Antigen can pull oh-my-zsh style plugins from various github\nrepositories. You are not limited to use plugins from the oh-my-zsh repository\nonly and you don\'t need to maintain your own fork and pull from upstream every\nnow and then. I actually encourage you to grab plugins and scripts from various\nsources, straight from the authors, before they even submit it to oh-my-zsh as a\npull request.\n\nAntigen also lets you switch the prompt theme with one command, just like that\n\n    antigen theme candy\n\nand your prompt is changed, just for this session of course (unless you put this\nline in your `.zshrc`).\n\n### Helping out\n\nWe are always looking for new contributors! We have a number of issues marked\nas ["Help wanted"][Help wanted] that are good places to jump in and get started. Take a look at\nour [Roadmap][] to see future projects and discuss ideas.\n\nPlease be sure to check out our [Contributing guidelines][] to understand our workflow,\nand our [Coding conventions][].\n\n### Feedback\n\nAny comments/suggestions/feedback is truly welcome. Please say hello to us on [Gitter][]. Or\nopen an issue to discuss something (anything!) about the project ;).\n\n### Articles\n\nThere are many articles written by Antigen users out there.
