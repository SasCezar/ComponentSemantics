Multi-platform and multi-language.\n\n[![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renovatebot/renovate/master/license)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/renovatebot/renovate/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/renovatebot/renovate)\n[![Renovate enabled](https://img.shields.io/badge/renovate-enabled-brightgreen.svg)](https://renovatebot.com/)\n\n## Why Use Renovate?\n\n- Receive automated Pull Requests whenever dependencies need updating.\n- Define schedules to avoid unnecessary noise in projects (e.g. for weekends or outside of working hours, or weekly updates, etc)\n- Relevant package files are discovered automatically (e.g. supports\n  monorepo architecture such as lerna or yarn workspaces without further configuration)\n- Bot behaviour is extremely customisable via configuration files (config as code)\n- Use eslint-like shared config presets for ease of use and simplifying configuration\n- Lock files are natively supported and updated in the same commit, including immediately resolving conflicts whenever PRs are merged\n- Supports GitHub (.com and Enterprise), GitLab (.com and CE/EE), Bitbucket Server, and Azure DevOps. Bitbucket Cloud is also supported but considered in Beta until it gets the thumbs-up from more users\n- Open source (installable via npm/yarn or Docker Hub) so can be self-hosted or used via GitHub App\n\n## Who Uses Renovate?\n\nRenovate was released in 2017 and already is widely used in the developer community, including:\n\n![Renovate Matrix](https://renovatebot.com/images/matrix.png)\n\n## The Renovate Approach\n\n- We believe everyone can benefit from automation, whether it's a little or a lot\n- Renovate should not cause you to change your workflow against your wishes, instead it should be adaptable to your existing workflow\n- All behaviour should be configurable, down to a ridiculous level if necessary\n- Autodetect settings wherever possible (to minimise configuration) but always allow overrides\n\n## Using Renovate\n\nThe easiest way to use Renovate if you are hosted on GitHub.com or GitLab.com is to install the hosted Renovate app. On Azure DevOps you can install Renovate as an extension from the marketplace.\n\nFor GitHub, go to [https://github.com/apps/renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate) to install\nit now. A GitHub Marketplace plan is required only for private repositories. [More details on the GitHub App installation](https://docs.renovatebot.com/install-github-app/).\n\nFor GitLab, log into [app.renovatebot.com/dashboard](https://app.renovatebot.com/dashboard) for a convenient way to add Renovate Bot to your project. Currently the GitLab app is free for both public and private repositories. [More details on the GitLab App installation](https://docs.renovatebot.com/install-gitlab-app/).\n\nFor Azure DevOps, visit the Visual Studio Marketplace and install the [Renovate Me](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jyc.vsts-extensions-renovate-me) extension in your organisation. From there you can create a pipeline with the `RenovateMe` task. [More details on how to configure the pipeline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jyc.vsts-extensions-renovate-me). Note: This extension is created and maintained personally by a Renovate developer/user so support requests relating to the extension itself cannot be answered directly in the main Renovate repository.\n\n## Configuration\n\nVisit https://docs.renovatebot.com/ for documentation, and in particular https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/ for a list of configuration options.\n\nYou can also raise an issue in https://github.com/renovatebot/config-help if you'd like to get your config reviewed or ask any questions.\n\n## Self-Hosting\n\nIf you are not on github.com or gitlab.com, or you prefer to run your own instance of Renovate then you have several options:\n\n- Install the `renovate` CLI tool from npmjs, run it on a schedule (e.g. using cron)\n- Run the `renovate/renovate` Docker Hub image (same content/versions as the CLI tool), run it on a schedule\n- Run the `renovate/renovate:slim` Docker Hub image if you only use package managers that don't need third party binaries (e.g. JS, Docker, Nuget, pip)\n\n[More details on the self-hosting development](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/master/docs/development/self-hosting.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you would like to contribute to Renovate or get a local copy running for some other reason, please see the instructions in [.github/contributing.md](.github/contributing.md).\n\n## Security / Disclosure\n\nIf you discover any important bug with Renovate that may pose a security problem, please disclose it confidentially to security@renovatebot.com first, so that it can be assessed and hopefully fixed prior to being exploited. Please do not raise GitHub issues for security-related doubts or problems.\n"
