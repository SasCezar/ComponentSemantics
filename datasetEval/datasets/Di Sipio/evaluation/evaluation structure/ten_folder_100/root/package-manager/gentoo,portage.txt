b'About Portage\n=============\n\nPortage is a package management system based on ports collections. The\nPackage Manager Specification Project (PMS) standardises and documents\nthe behaviour of Portage so that ebuild repositories can be used by\nother package managers.\n\n\nDependencies\n============\n\nPython and Bash should be the only hard dependencies. Python 2.7 is the\nminimum supported version.\n\nNative Extensions\n=================\n\nPortage includes some optional native extensions which can be built\nin the source tree by running the following command:\n\n    python setup.py build_ext --inplace --portage-ext-modules\n\nThe following setup.cfg settings can be used to enable building of\nnative extensions for all invocations of the build_ext command (the\nbuild_ext command is invoked automatically by other build commands):\n\n   [build_ext]\n   portage-ext-modules=true\n\nCurrently, the native extensions only include libc bindings which are\nused to validate LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE behavior for EAPI 6. If the\nnative extensions have not been built, then portage will use ctypes\ninstead.\n\nLicensing and Legalese\n=======================\n\nPortage is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nversion 2 as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nPortage is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
