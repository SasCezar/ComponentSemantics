The only missing pieces to use them as full-featured Linux distro were gcc and make with their dependencies. Well, these pieces aren\'t missing anymore. Say hello to Chromebrew!\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\nYou will need a Chromebook with developer mode enabled.  To do so, select your device on\n[the ChromiumOS Wiki](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices) and follow the instructions listed there.\n\nPlease be aware of the fact that developer mode is insecure if not properly configured. Setting a password as instructed in the VT-2 login screen is essential. It is also recommended to enable signed boot:\n\n```bash\nsudo chromeos-setdevpasswd\nsudo crossystem dev_boot_signed_only=1\n```\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe beta, dev, and Canary channels are ***not*** supported and should ***not*** be used with Chromebrew.\nFailure to take notice of this will cause major issues with your Chromebrew installation.\nSee issue [#2890](https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew/issues/2890) and the [FAQ](https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew/wiki/FAQ) for more details.\n\nOpen the terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and type `shell`.\n\nIf this command returns `ERROR: unknown command: shell`, please have a second look at the prerequisites and make sure your Chromebook is in developer mode.\n\nThen download and run the installation script below:\n\n    wget -q -O - https://raw.github.com/skycocker/chromebrew/master/install.sh | bash\n\n    -- or --\n\n    curl -Ls git.io/vddgY | bash\n\nOn a rooted Google OnHub, the command needs to be run with the "chronos" user. In order to make su work, a password is needed for the chronos user.\n\n    # passwd chronos\n    Changing password for chronos.\n    Enter new UNIX password:\n    Retype new UNIX password:\n    # su - chronos\n    Password:\n    $ curl -Ls git.io/vddgY | bash\n\nHelp\n----\n\nPlease check out the [wiki](https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew/wiki) to find out more information about Chromebrew including helpful tips, resource links and frequently asked questions.
