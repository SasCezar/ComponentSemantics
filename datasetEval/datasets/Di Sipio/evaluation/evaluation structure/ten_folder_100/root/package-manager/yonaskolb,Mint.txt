It makes installing, running and distributing these tools much easier.\n\n- \xe2\x9c\x85 easily run a specific **version** of a package\n- \xe2\x9c\x85 **link** a package **globally**\n- \xe2\x9c\x85 builds are **cached** by version\n- \xe2\x9c\x85 use **different versions** of a package side by side\n- \xe2\x9c\x85 easily run the **latest** version of a package\n- \xe2\x9c\x85 distribute your own packages **without recipes and formulas**\n- \xe2\x9c\x85 specify a list of versioned packages in a **Mintfile** for easy use\n\nHomebrew is a popular method of distributing Swift executables, but that requires creating a formula and then maintaining that formula. Running specific versions of homebrew installations can also be tricky as only one global version is installed at any one time. Mint installs your package via SPM and lets you run multiple versions of that package, which are installed and cached in a central place.\n\nIf your Swift executable package builds with SPM, then it can be run with Mint! See [Support](#support) for details.\n\n## Why is it called Mint?\nSwift Packager Manager Tools -> SPMT -> Spearmint -> Mint! \xf0\x9f\x8c\xb1\xf0\x9f\x98\x84\n> Mint: a place where something is produced or manufactured\n\n## Installing\nMake sure Xcode 10.2 is installed first.\n\n### Homebrew\n\n```sh\n$ brew install mint\n```\n\n### Make\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint.git\n$ cd Mint\n$ make\n```\n\n### Using Mint itself!\n\n##### Install\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint.git\n$ cd Mint\n$ swift run mint install yonaskolb/mint\n```\n\n##### Update\n```sh\n$ mint install yonaskolb/mint\n```\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\n**Use CLI**\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint.git\n$ cd Mint\n$ swift run mint\n```\n\n**Use as dependency**\n\nAdd the following to your Package.swift file\'s dependencies:\n\n```swift\n.package(url: "https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint.git", from: "0.10.0"),\n```\n\nAnd then import wherever needed: `import MintKit`\n\n## Road to 1.0\nUntil 1.0 is reached, minor versions will be breaking.\n\n## Usage\n\nRun `mint help` to see usage instructions.\n\n- **install**: Installs a package, so it can be run with `run` later, and also links that version globally\n- **run**: Runs a package. This will install it first if it isn\'t already installed, though won\'t link it globally. It\'s useful for running a certain version.\n- **list**: Lists all currently installed packages and versions.\n- **uninstall**: Uninstalls a package by name.\n- **bootstrap**: Installs all the packages in your [Mintfile](#mintfile), by default, without linking them globally\n\n**Package reference**\n\n`run` and `install` commands require a package reference parameter. This can be a shorthand for a github repo (`mint install realm/SwiftLint`) or a fully qualified git path (`mint install https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint.git`). In the case of `run` you can also just pass the name of the repo if it is already installed (`run swiftlint`). This will do a lookup of all installed packages.\nAn optional version can be specified by appending `@version`, otherwise the newest tag or master will be used. Note that if you don\'t specify a version, the current tags must be loaded remotely each time.\n\n#### Examples\n```sh\n$ mint run yonaskolb/XcodeGen@1.2.4 xcodegen --spec spec.yml # pass some arguments\n$ mint install yonaskolb/XcodeGen@1.2.4 --no-link # installs a certain version but doesn\'t link it globally\n$ mint install yonaskolb/XcodeGen # install newest tag\n$ mint install yonaskolb/XcodeGen@master --force #reinstall the master branch\n$ mint run yonaskolb/XcodeGen@1.2.4 # run 1.2.4\n$ mint run XcodeGen # use newest tag and find XcodeGen in installed packages\n```\n\n### Linking\nBy default Mint symlinks your installs into `usr/local/bin` on `mint install`, unless `--no-link` is passed. This means a package will be accessible from anywhere, and you don\'t have to prepend commands with `mint run package`. Note that only one linked version can be used at a time though. If you need to run a specific older version use `mint run`.\n\n### Mintfile\nA `Mintfile` can specify a list of versioned packages. It makes installing and running these packages easy, as the specific repos and versions are centralized.\n\nSimply place this file in the directory you\'re running Mint in. The format of the `Mintfile` is simply a list of packages in the same form as the usual package parameter:\n\n```\nyonaskolb/xcodegen@1.10.3\nyonaskolb/genesis@0.2.0\n```\n\nThen you can simply run a package with:\n\n```sh\nmint run xcodegen\n```\n\nOr install all the packages (without linking them globally) in one go with:\n\n```sh\nmint bootstrap\n```\n\nIf you prefer to link them globally, do such with:\n\n```sh\nmint bootstrap --link\n```\n\n### Advanced\n- You can use `--silent` in `mint run` to silence any output from mint itself. Useful if forwarding output somewhere else.\n- You can set `MINT_PATH` and `MINT_LINK_PATH` envs to configure where mint caches builds, and where it symlinks global installs. These default to `/usr/local/lib/mint` and `/usr/local/bin` respectively\n- You can use `mint install --force` to reinstall a package even if it\'s already installed. This shouldn\'t be required unless you are pointing at a branch and want to update it.\n\n### Linux\nMint works on Linux but has some limitations:\n- linux doesn\'t support building with a statically linked version of Swift. This means when a new version of swift comes out the old installs won\'t work on linux. A stable ABI in Swift 5 will remove the need for this.\n- Linux is case sensitive so you must specify the correct case for repo urls as well as executables.\n\n## Support\nIf your Swift command line tool builds with the Swift Package Manager than it will automatically install and run with mint! \n\nMake sure you have defined an `executable` product type in the `products` list within your `Package.swift`.\n\n```swift\nlet package = Package(\n    name: "Foo",\n    products: [\n        .executable(name: "foo", targets: ["Foo"]),\n    ],\n    targets: [\n      .target(name: "Foo"),\n      ...\n    ]\n)\n```\n\nYou can then add this to the `Installing` section in your readme:\n````\n### [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint)\n```\n$ mint install github_name/repo_name\n```\n````\n\n### Resources\nThe Swift Package Manager doesn\'t yet have a way of specifying resources directories. If your tool requires access to resources from the repo you require a custom `Package.resources` file. This is a plain text file that lists the resources directories on different lines:\n\n```\nMyFiles\nMyOtherFiles\n```\nIf this file is found in you repo, then all those directories will be copied into the same path as the executable.\n\n\n## A list of popular Mint compatible packages \xf0\x9f\x8c\xb1\n\n- mint install [jkmathew/Assetizer](https://github.com/jkmathew/Assetizer)\n- mint install [Carthage/Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)\n- mint install [JohnSundell/Marathon](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Marathon)\n- mint install [LinusU/RasterizeXCAssets](https://github.com/LinusU/RasterizeXCAssets)\n- mint install [krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery)\n- mint install [yonaskolb/SwagGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/SwagGen)\n- mint install [nicklockwood/SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat)\n- mint install [SwiftGen/SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen)\n- mint install [realm/SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)\n- mint install [yonaskolb/XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)\n- mint install [artemnovichkov/Carting](https://github.com/artemnovichkov/Carting)\n- mint install [num42/icon-resizer-swift](https://github.com/num42/icon-resizer-swift)\n- mint install [MakeAWishFoundation/SwiftyMocky](https://github.com/MakeAWishFoundation/SwiftyMocky)\n- mint install [thii/xcbeautify](https://github.com/thii/xcbeautify)\n\nFeel free to add your own!\n'
