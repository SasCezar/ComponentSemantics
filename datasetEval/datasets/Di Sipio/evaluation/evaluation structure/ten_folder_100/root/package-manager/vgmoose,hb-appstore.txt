This is a replacement to the older [Wii U Homebrew App Store](https://github.com/vgmoose/wiiu-hbas).\n\n## Supported Platforms\n### Nintendo Switch\nTo run this program, a Nintendo Switch with access to the Homebrew Menu is required. This can be done on most Switches manufactured before July 2018, for compatibility check your serial number at [ismyswitchpatched.com](https://ismyswitchpatched.com). To run hbmenu, see the tutorial [here](https://guide.sdsetup.com/).\n\nExtract the latest [hb-appstore](https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore/releases) to `sd:/switch/appstore/`, and run "hb App Store" from within hbmenu. When you\'re done, you can press the Minus (-) button to exit.\n\n### Nintendo Wii U\nTo run this program, a Wii U with access to the Homebrew Launcher is required. This can be done on any firmware. To run the Homebrew Launcher, see the tutorial [here](https://wiiu.hacks.guide).\n\nExtract the latest [hb-appstore](https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore/releases) to `sd:/wiiu/apps/appstore/`, and run "hb App Store" from within Homebrew Launcher. When you\'re done, you can press the Minus (-) button to exit.\n\n### Web and Desktop\nWeb browsers can download files from the Homebrew App Store at [apps.fortheusers.org](https://apps.fortheusers.org). Source code: [hbas-frontend](https://gitlab.com/4TU/hbas-frontend)\n\nDesktop platforms (Windows, MacOS, and Linux), can use @LyfeOnEdge\'s [unofficial-appstore](https://github.com/LyfeOnEdge/unofficial-appstore), or their alternative program: [HBUpdater](https://github.com/LyfeOnEdge/HBUpdater)\n\n## Maintaining a repo\nSee [get\'s instructions](https://github.com/vgmoose/get#setting-up-repos) for setting up a repository. Everything is designed to be statically hosted. If there\'s no repo provided in the `repos.json` config file, then it will generate a default one pointing to [switchbru.com/appstore](http://switchbru.com/appstore/).\n\nIf you run into any issues and need help maintaining or setting up a libget repo, feel free to get in touch with vgmoose at me@vgmoose.com or on Discord.\n\n## Compilation instructions\nThis program is written using SDL2 and has dependencies on libsdl, libcurl, and zlib. It also makes use of libget which is included in this repo as a submodule.\n\nYou can get pre-compiled binaries for each platform under [Pipelines](https://gitlab.com/4TU/hb-appstore/pipelines) for a given commit. The download artifacts dropdown is to the right of the build passing status.\n\n### Building with Docker\nThe easiest way to build is to use a docker container. Docker can be used to build for any of the three supported platforms, using the dependency helper scripts. This is how the pre-compiled binaries are built.\n\n1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)\n2. Run the following, replacing `switch` with the target platform (one of `switch`, `wiiu`, or `pc`):\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore.git\ncd hb-appstore\ndocker run -e PLATFORM=\'switch\' -v $(pwd):/code -it ubuntu:18.10 /bin/bash\n```\n3. You should now be in the container, run:\n```\ncd /code\n./dependency_helper.sh\nmake\n```\n\nDepending on which platform you chose, `appstore.nro` or `appstore.rpx` should now be sitting in the cloned directory.\n\n### Building for Switch (with libnx)\n1. Install [dkp-pacman](https://devkitpro.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=8702)\n2. Install devkitA64 and needed Switch dependencies via dkp-pacman:\n```\nsudo dkp-pacman -S devkitA64 libnx switch-tools switch-curl switch-bzip2 switch-freetype switch-libjpeg-turbo switch-libwebp switch-sdl2 switch-sdl2_gfx switch-sdl2_image switch-sdl2_ttf switch-zlib switch-libpng switch-mesa\n```\n3. Once it\'s all setup, recursively clone the repo and run make:\n```\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore.git\ncd hb-appstore\nmake -f Makefile.switch\n```\n\nIf all goes well, `appstore.nro` should be sitting in the current directory.\n\n### Building for Wii U (with WUT)\n1. Install [dkp-pacman](https://devkitpro.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=8702)\n2. Setup [wiiu-fling](https://gitlab.com/QuarkTheAwesome/wiiu-fling#wiiu-fling) according to the instructions\n3. Install devkitPPC and needed Wii U dependencies via dkp-pacman:\n```\nsudo dkp-pacman -S wut wiiu-sdl2 devkitPPC wiiu-libromfs wiiu-sdl2_gfx wiiu-sdl2_image wiiu-sdl2_ttf wiiu-sdl2_mixer ppc-zlib ppc-bzip2 ppc-freetype ppc-mpg123 ppc-libpng wiiu-curl-headers ppc-pkg-config wiiu-pkg-config\n```\n4. Once the environment is setup:\n```\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore.git\ncd hb-appstore\nmake -f Makefile.wiiu\n```\n\nIf all goes well, `appstore.rpx` should be sitting in the current directory.\n\n### Building for PC\nThere\'s a makefile for building the SDL2 app on PC as well, primarily used for debugging and performance monitoring. Below instructions are for Ubuntu, but should be similar on other platforms:\n```\nsudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev zlib1g-dev gcc g++ libcurl4-openssl-dev\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore.git\ncd hb-appstore\nmake -f Makefile.pc\n```\n\n### License\nThis software is licensed under the GPLv3.\n\n#### Maintainers\n- [vgmoose](https://github.com/vgmoose)\n- [pwsincd](https://github.com/pwsincd)\n- [rw-r-r_0644](https://github.com/rw-r-r-0644)\n- [crc32](https://github.com/crc-32)\n\n#### Contributing\nIf you have some functionality that you\'d like to see feel free to discuss it on an [issues page](https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore/issues), or if you already have an implementation or desire that you\'d like to see, feel free to fork and make a [pull request](https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore/pulls)!\n\nIt\'s not required, but running a clang-format before making a PR helps to clean up styling issues:\n```\nfind . \\( -name "*.cpp" -or -name "*.hpp" \\) -not -path "./libs/*" -exec clang-format -i {} \\;\n```\n\n'
