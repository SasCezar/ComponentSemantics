Buckaroo fills this gap for C++.\n\nThe Buckaroo workflow looks like this:\n\n```bash=\n# Create your project file\n$ buckaroo init\n\n# Install dependencies\n$ buckaroo add github.com/buckaroo-pm/boost-thread@branch=master\n\n# Run your code\n$ buck run :my-app\n```\n\nWe have an [FAQ](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/wiki/FAQ).\n\n### Package Registries\n\nPull dependencies directly from GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, hosted Git and HTTP. [How?](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/wiki/Git-as-a-Package-Registry)\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="www/registries.png?raw=true" alt="Package Registries" width="500px" />\n</p>\n\n### IDE Integrations\n\nSupport for major IDEs and tools. Integration guides can be found in [the docs](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/wiki/).\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="www/ides.png?raw=true" alt="IDE Integrations" width="500px" />\n</p>\n\n### Features\n\nC++ has unique requirements, so Buckaroo is a highly sophisticated piece of software.\n\n * Pull dependencies directly from GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, hosted Git and HTTP\n * Fully reproducible builds and dependency resolution\n * Completely decentralized - there is no central server or publishing process\n * Allows any build configuration (even on a package-by-package basis)\n * Private and public dependencies to avoid "dependency hell"\n * Multiple libraries per package, so tools like Lerna are unnecessary\n * Pull individual packages out of mono-repos\n * Full support for semantic versioning (but only when you want it!)\n * Live at head! Move fast by depending directly on Git branches, but in a controlled way\n * Blazing fast resolution using clever heuristics\n * Version equivalency checks to reduce dependency conflicts\n * TOML configuration files for convenient editing by computers and humans\n * Works offline (with a populated cache)\n * Enable Upgrade Bot to keep everything up-to-date with a single click\n\n### Get Started\n\nPlease refer to [the Wiki](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/wiki) for [installation instructions](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/wiki/installation)! \xe2\x9c\x8c\xef\xb8\x8f\n\n#### Quick Install\n\nBuckaroo is shipped as a self-contained executable, so all you need to do is download the bundle from the [releases page](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/releases).\n\n##### Linux\n\n```bash\n$ wget https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/releases/download/v2.2.0/buckaroo-linux -O buckaroo\n$ chmod +x ./buckaroo\n$ ./buckaroo\n```\n\n##### macOS\n\nWith Homebrew:\n\n```bash\n$ brew install loopperfect/lp/buckaroo\n```\n\nOr without Homebrew:\n\n```bash\n$ wget https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/releases/download/v2.2.0/buckaroo-macos -O buckaroo\n$ chmod +x ./buckaroo\n$ ./buckaroo\n```\n\n##### Windows\n\nYou can use the [Chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/buckaroo): \n\n```bash\nchoco install buckaroo\n```\n\nOr, download [buckaroo.exe](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/releases/download/v2.0.3/buckaroo-windows.exe) from the [releases page](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/releases/v2.2.0).\n\n### How Buckaroo Works\n\nThe Buckaroo model is very simple. Packages live in source-control, and a manifest file is used to describe dependencies. This points to further manifests to create a dependency graph. Buckaroo works directly over Git and HTTP.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="www/how-buckaroo-works.png?raw=true" alt="Buckaroo" />\n</p>\n\nHead over to [the Wiki](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/wiki) for more detailed information.\n\n## Attribution\n\nSVG graphics in diagrams are made by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com/) from [www.flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/) and are licensed by [Creative Commons BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\n'
