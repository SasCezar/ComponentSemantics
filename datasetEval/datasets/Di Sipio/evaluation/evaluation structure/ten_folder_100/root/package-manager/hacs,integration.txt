I figured it would be better to start over with the same "mission", that\'s where HACS came to life.\r\n\r\nHACS is not a full replacement for `custom_updater` and even though their "mission" is the same how they work is completely different, where the main issue is to make it easy for both the user and the developer, for most elements it will just work (with some exceptions of course).\r\n\r\n## Useful links\r\n\r\n- [General documentation](https://hacs.xyz/)\r\n- [Installation](https://hacs.xyz/docs/installation/manual)\r\n- [Configuration](https://hacs.xyz/docs/configuration/start)\r\n- [FAQ](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq)\r\n- [Repository](https://github.com/hacs/integration)\r\n- [Forum post](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/custom-component-hacs/121727)\r\n- [BuyMeCoffee? :see_no_evil:](https://buymeacoffee.com/ludeeus)\r\n\r\n**YouTube Promo for HACS\xf0\x9f\x99\x88:**\r\n\r\n[![HACS Promo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/vq0qQtDAOW0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq0qQtDAOW0 "HACS Promo")\r\n\r\n**Install and Setup Walkthrough by [DrZzs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7G4tLa4Kt6A9e3hJ-HO8ng)**\r\n\r\n[![Walkthrough](https://img.youtube.com/vi/aJTTCAvzpIU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTTCAvzpIU "Walkthrough")\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\n~~If~~ When you experience issues/bugs with this the best way to report them is to open an issue in **this** repo.\r\n\r\n[Issue link](https://hacs.xyz/issues/)\r\n'
