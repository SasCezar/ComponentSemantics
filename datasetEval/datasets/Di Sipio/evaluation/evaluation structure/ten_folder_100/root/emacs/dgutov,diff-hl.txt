b'About\r\n=====\r\n\r\n`diff-hl-mode` highlights uncommitted changes on the left side of the window,\r\nallows you to jump between and revert them selectively.\r\n\r\nFor the usage instructions and the list of commands, see the Commentary section\r\ninside the file.\r\n\r\nTested with Git, Mercurial, Bazaar and SVN. May work with other VC backends, too.\r\n\r\nThe package also contains auxiliary modes:\r\n\r\n* `diff-hl-dired-mode` provides similar functionality in Dired.\r\n* `diff-hl-margin-mode` changes the highlighting function to\r\n  use the margin instead of the fringe.\r\n* `diff-hl-amend-mode` shifts the reference revision back by one.\r\n* `diff-hl-flydiff-mode` implements highlighting changes on the fly.\r\n  It requires Emacs 24.4 or newer.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nPut this into your init script:\r\n\r\n```lisp\r\n(global-diff-hl-mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck out the Commentary section in each file for more detailed usage\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n=====\r\n\r\ndiff-hl-mode\r\n-----\r\nTop window: a buffer in this minor mode, bottom window: the corresponding diff.\r\n\r\n![screenie](screenshot.png)\r\n\r\ndiff-hl-dired-mode\r\n-----\r\n\r\n![screenie](screenshot-dired.png)\r\n\r\ndiff-hl-margin-mode\r\n-----\r\n\r\n![screenie](screenshot-margin.png)\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n=====\r\n\r\nEmacs 24.3+.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n=====\r\n\r\n* By default `diff-hl-mode` uses the corresponding VC diff command, so\r\n  it\'s only accurate when the buffer is in saved state. Check out\r\n  `diff-hl-flydiff-mode`, it aims to handle unsaved buffers as well.\r\n\r\n* To use an\r\n  [alternative diff algorithm](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32365271/whats-the-difference-between-git-diff-patience-and-git-diff-histogram)\r\n  with Git, add a corresponding argument to `vc-git-diff-switches`,\r\n  e.g. `(setq vc-git-diff-switches \'("--histogram"))`. Using the\r\n  `diff.algorithm` option doesn\'t work\r\n  [because](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/294622)\r\n  `vc-git-diff` calls `git diff-index`. `diff-hl-flydiff-mode` does\r\n  not support alternative algorithms, because it uses the external\r\n  `diff` program.\r\n\r\n* We conflict with other modes when they put indicators on the fringe,\r\n  such as [Flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck). This is\r\n  rarely a significant problem, since if you\'re using such a mode,\r\n  you\'d usually want to fix all errors and warnings before continuing,\r\n  and then the conflicting indicators go away.\r\n\r\n* There\'s no fringe when Emacs is running in the console, but the navigation\r\n  and revert commands still work. Consider turning `diff-hl-margin-mode` on,\r\n  to show the indicators in the margin instead.\r\n\r\n* Frame-local and buffer-local values of `line-spacing` are not supported.\r\n\r\n* Fringe width up to 16 works best (because we can\'t define a bitmap\r\n  with width above that number).\r\n\r\n* [emacs-git-gutter](https://github.com/syohex/emacs-git-gutter) shows\r\n  indicators in the margin by default, allows you to customize how the\r\n  indicators look more easily, and has a "stage hunk" command.\r\n\r\nIntegration\r\n=====\r\n\r\nIf you\'re using some package other than `vc` to commit changes, it might\r\nnot run `vc-checkin-hook` after commits. In that case, you\'ll need to\r\neither add `diff-hl-update` to the hook it does run, or advise some\r\nfunction that\'s called in the buffer after its state has changed.\r\n\r\npsvn\r\n-----\r\n\r\n```lisp\r\n(advice-add \'svn-status-update-modeline :after #\'diff-hl-update)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMagit\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf you\'re using a version before 2.4.0, it defines `magit-revert-buffer-hook`\r\n(or `magit-not-reverted-hook`), which we use.\r\n\r\nWhen using Magit 2.4 or newer, add this to your init script:\r\n\r\n```lisp\r\n(add-hook \'magit-post-refresh-hook \'diff-hl-magit-post-refresh)\r\n```\r\n'
