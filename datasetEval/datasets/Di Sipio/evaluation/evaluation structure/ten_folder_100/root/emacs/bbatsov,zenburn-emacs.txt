It\'s my personal belief (and\nthat of its many users I presume) that it\'s one of the best low\ncontrast color themes out there and that it is exceptionally easy on\nthe eyes.\n\nThis theme uses the "new" (it used to be new several years ago when I\ncreated this package) built-in theming support available starting with\nEmacs 24.1.\n\n![Overview screenshot](screenshots/overview.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Manual\n\nDownload `zenburn-theme.el` to the directory `~/.emacs.d/themes/`. Add this to your\n`.emacs` (or `init.el`):\n\n```lisp\n(add-to-list \'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")\n```\n\nNow you can load the theme with the interactive function `load-theme` like this:\n\n`M-x load-theme RET zenburn`\n\n### Package.el\n\nZenburn is available in both [MELPA Stable](http://stable.melpa.org)\nand [MELPA](http://melpa.org).\n\nYou can install `zenburn` with the following command:\n\n`M-x package-install zenburn-theme`\n\nTo load it automatically on Emacs startup add this to your init file:\n\n```lisp\n(load-theme \'zenburn t)\n```\n\n### Emacs Prelude\n\nZenburn for Emacs is already bundled into\n[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude). If you\'re a\nPrelude user - you\'re probably already using Zenburn, since it\'s\nPrelude\'s default color theme. You can load Zenburn at any time by\n`M-x load-theme zenburn`.\n\n### Debian and Ubuntu\n\nUsers of Debian 9 or later or Ubuntu 16.10 or later may simply\n`apt-get install elpa-zenburn-theme`.\n\n## Customization\n\n### Custom colors\n\nIf you\'d like to tweak the theme by changing just a few colors, you can\ndo so by defining new values in the `zenburn-override-colors-alist`\nvariable before loading the theme.\n\nFor example, to customize just the lighter background colors, you could add\nto your init file:\n\n```elisp\n(setq zenburn-override-colors-alist\n      \'(("zenburn-bg+05" . "#282828")\n        ("zenburn-bg+1"  . "#2F2F2F")\n        ("zenburn-bg+2"  . "#3F3F3F")\n        ("zenburn-bg+3"  . "#4F4F4F")))\n(load-theme \'zenburn t)\n```\n\nTo see the full list of color names you can override, consult the\n`zenburn-theme.el` source file.\n\n### Scaled headings\n\nThe theme supports scaling the font size for some headings and titles as well\nas using a variable-pitch font for those. To enable this, use the following\nsettings:\n\n```elisp\n;; use variable-pitch fonts for some headings and titles\n(setq zenburn-use-variable-pitch t)\n\n;; scale headings in org-mode\n(setq zenburn-scale-org-headlines t)\n\n;; scale headings in outline-mode\n(setq zenburn-scale-outline-headlines t)\n```\n\nThe screenshot above shows the default setting with no scaled or\nvariable-pitch fonts. With scaled headings and variable-pitch fonts it looks\nlike this:\n\n![Scaled screenshot](screenshots/scaled.png)\n\n## Ugly colors in the terminal Emacs version\n\nIf your Emacs looks considerably uglier in a terminal (compared to the\nGUI version) try adding this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:\n\n```bash\nexport TERM=xterm-256color\n```\n\nSource the `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc`) file and start Emacs again.\n\n# Bugs & Improvements\n\nPlease, report any problems that you find on the project\'s integrated\nissue tracker.
