"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)\n(package-initialize)\n```\n\nOnce that is done, then just refresh the packages and install it with.\n\n* <kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>\n* <kbd>M-x package-install yasnippet-snippets</kbd>\n\nNow all the snippets will load automatically, as soon as yasnippet loads.\n\n## On Debian \xe2\x89\xa510 and derivatives such as Ubuntu \xe2\x89\xa5 18.10\n\n`sudo apt install elpa-yasnippet-snippets`\n\n# Contributing\n\nIf you have any useful snippets for any language or framework, then please feel free to contribute, by opening a PR or an issue if you have any suggestions.\n\nTo study the current snippets, I suggest that you use `M-x yas-describe-tables`,\nwhich will show a table representation of all the snippets that are available in the current mode.\n\n\n# Guidelines\n\nSnippets need to be generic enough to be useful for everyone, and not contain anything specific to your own system.\n\n# Various notes\n\n## HTML snippets\n\nUntil September 1st 2014 there were a lot of HTML snippets in the repository, which sometimes were useful, but I came to the conclusion that yasnippet was not the right tool for them, so they were removed in this pull request:\nhttps://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets/pull/49\n\nTo everyone writing a lot of HTML I suggest using [emmet mode](https://github.com/smihica/emmet-mode) instead, which is a much more powerful mode for writing HTML tags.\n'
