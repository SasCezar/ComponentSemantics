Its goal is to\nprovide a nice set of features operating on a project level without\nintroducing external dependencies (when feasible). For instance -\nfinding project files has a portable implementation written in pure\nEmacs Lisp without the use of GNU `find` (but for performance sake an\nindexing mechanism backed by external commands exists as well).\n\nProjectile tries to be practical - portability is great, but if some\nexternal tools could speed up some task substantially and the tools\nare available, Projectile will leverage them.\n\nThis library provides easy project management and navigation. The\nconcept of a project is pretty basic - just a folder containing\nspecial file. Currently `git`, `mercurial`, `darcs` and `bazaar` repos\nare considered projects by default. So are `lein`, `maven`, `sbt`,\n`scons`, `rebar` and `bundler` projects. If you want to mark a folder\nmanually as a project just create an empty `.projectile` file in\nit. Some of Projectile\'s features:\n\n* jump to a file in project\n* jump to files at point in project\n* jump to a directory in project\n* jump to a file in a directory\n* jump to a project buffer\n* jump to a test in project\n* toggle between files with same names but different extensions (e.g. `.h` <-> `.c/.cpp`, `Gemfile` <-> `Gemfile.lock`)\n* toggle between code and its test (e.g. `main.service.js` <-> `main.service.spec.js`)\n* jump to recently visited files in the project\n* switch between projects you have worked on\n* kill all project buffers\n* replace in project\n* multi-occur in project buffers\n* grep in project\n* regenerate project etags or gtags (requires [ggtags](https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags)).\n* visit project in dired\n* run make in a project with a single key chord\n* check for dirty repositories\n* toggle read-only mode for the entire project\n\nHere\'s a glimpse of Projectile in action:\n\n![Projectile Screenshot](doc/screenshots/projectile.png)\n\nYou can support my work on Projectile via\n [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/bbatsov),\n [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bbatsov) and\n [Salt](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/projectile).\n\n## Quickstart\n\nThe instructions that follow are meant to get you from zero to a running Projectile setup\nin a minute.  See the\n[official manual](https://docs.projectile.mx) for (way) more\ndetails.\n\n### Installation\n\n`package.el` is the built-in package manager in Emacs.\n\nProjectile is available on the two major `package.el` community\nmaintained repos -\n[MELPA Stable](http://stable.melpa.org)\nand [MELPA](http://melpa.org).\n\nYou can install Projectile with the following command:\n\n<kbd>M-x</kbd> `package-install` <kbd>[RET]</kbd> `projectile` <kbd>[RET]</kbd>\n\nAlternatively, users of Debian 9 or later or Ubuntu 16.04 or later may\nsimply `apt-get install elpa-projectile`.\n\nFinally add this to your Emacs config:\n\n```el\n(projectile-mode +1)\n(define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "s-p") \'projectile-command-map)\n(define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "C-c p") \'projectile-command-map)\n```\n\nThose keymap prefixes are just a suggestion. Feel free to put there whatever works best for you.\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nEnable `projectile-mode`, open a file in one of your projects and type a command such as <kbd>C-c p f</kbd>.\n\nSee the user manual for more details.\n\n## Caveats\n\n* Some operations like search (grep) depend (presently) on external\n  utilities such as `find`.\n\n## Known issues\n\nCheck out the project\'s\n[issue list](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open)\na list of unresolved issues. By the way - feel free to fix any of them\nand sent me a pull request. :-)\n\n## Contributors\n\nHere\'s a [list](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/contributors) of all the people who have contributed to the\ndevelopment of Projectile.\n\n## Changelog\n\nA fairly extensive changelog is available [here](CHANGELOG.md).\n\n[badge-license]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL_3-green.svg\n\n## License\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2011-2019 Bozhidar Batsov and\n[contributors](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/contributors).\n\nDistributed under the GNU General Public License, version 3\n'
