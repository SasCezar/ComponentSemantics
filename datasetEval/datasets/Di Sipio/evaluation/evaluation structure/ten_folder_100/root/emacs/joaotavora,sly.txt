Everything can be copied to the\n  REPL;\n* Modern [flex-style completion](#company-flex-completion).  Much snappier when\n  using [company][14], and no plugin required;\n* Cleanly ASDF-loaded by default, including contribs, which are enabled\n  out-of-the-box;\n* Multiple inspectors;\n* Support for [NAMED-READTABLES][11], [macrostep.el][12] and [quicklisp][13]\n\nSLY tracks SLIME\'s bugfixes.  All its familar features (debugger, inspector,\nxref, etc...) are still available, with improved overall UX.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nEnsure that [MELPA][10] is setup as usual and ask `M-x package-install` to\ninstall the package `sly`.\n\n*That\'s it*. `sly-mode` will automatically come up in every `.lisp` file. To\nfire up SLY, connect to a Lisp and get a friendly REPL, use `M-x sly`.\n\nEven if you already have SLIME installed, SLY will ask you and temporarily\ndisable it for the Emacs session.\n\n<a name="animated_gifs"></a>\n_Obligatory animated gif section_\n-----------------------------------\n\n<a name="company-flex-completion"></a>\n[Flex completion](http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/#Completion)\n\n![company-flex-completion](./doc/animations/company-flex-completion.gif)\n\n<a name="repl"></a>\n[Backreferences](http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/#REPL-backreferences)\n\n![backreferences](./doc/animations/backreferences.gif)\n\n[Reverse i-search](http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/#REPL-commands)\n\n![reverse-isearch](./doc/animations/reverse-isearch.gif)\n\n<a name="stickers"></a>\n[Stickers](http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/#Stickers)\n\n![stickers-example](./doc/animations/stickers-example.gif)\n\nInstall from git\n-------------------\n\nClone this repository, add this to your `~/.emacs` file and fill in the\nappropriate file names:\n\n```el\n(add-to-list \'load-path "~/dir/to/cloned/sly")\n(require \'sly-autoloads)\n(setq inferior-lisp-program "/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl")\n```\n\nIf you wish to byte-compile SLY yourself (not needed generally) you can do `make\ncompile compile-contrib` in the dir where you cloned SLY.\n\nRunning the server standalone\n-----------------------------\n\nThis also works\n```\n$ sbcl\n...\n* (push #p"~/dir/to/sly" asdf:*central-registry*)\n* (asdf:load-system :slynk)\n* (slynk:create-server :port 4008)\n```\n\nNow in Emacs you can do `sly-connect` and give it the host and the 4008 port as\na destination.\n\nAdditional Contribs\n-------------------\n\n* https://github.com/joaotavora/sly-quicklisp\n* https://github.com/joaotavora/sly-named-readtables\n* https://github.com/mmgeorge/sly-asdf\n* https://github.com/40ants/sly-package-inferred\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSLY is free software. All files, unless explicitly stated otherwise, are\npublic domain. ASCII artwork is copyright by Felix Lee and others.\n\nFork\n----\n\nSLIME is the work of Eric Marsden, Luke Gorrie, Helmut Eller, Tobias\nC. Rittweiler and [many others][8]. I forked SLIME because I used it daily,\nfor work, had a long list of hacks developed for myself, and wanted to share\nthem with others.\n\nIn 2013, SLIME development was stalling, patches and issues rotting. In early \n2014,  Lu\xc3\xads Oliveira and myself moved SLIME to Github and set up its Travis CI \nsystem. I brought in the old bug reports from the Launchpad tracker, fixed \nlong-standing problems and submitted many changes, particularly to the \nunder-curated but popular "contrib" section.\n\nNow, the changes that SLY brings to the table are too deep at the Elisp and Lisp\nlevel to be accepted to SLIME, given its current focus on stability (for the\nrecord, I find this perfectly reasonable). The new features, such as stickers or\nmultiple inspectors, cannot be realized well using only the existing "contrib"\nsystem.  Finally, SLY frees itself from the shackles of Emacs 23 and supports\nEmacs 24.3+ only, allowing for much cleaner code and liberal use of lexical\nbinding.\n\nThe list of technical reasons is bigger than this though, and you can read up on\nthem in the [CONTRIBUTING.md][9] file.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n[Open an issue or a pull request][4], but at least have a quick look at the\nfirst part [CONTRIBUTING.md][5] file for instructions on how to contribute.\n\n[1]: http://www.common-lisp.net/project/slime/\n[2]: https://github.com/joaotavora/sly/blob/master/README.md#fork\n[4]: https://github.com/joaotavora/sly/issues\n[5]: https://github.com/joaotavora/sly/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n[6]: https://github.com/joaotavora/sly/blob/master/NEWS.md\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqWkVvubnSI\n[8]: http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Credits.html#Credits\n[9]: https://github.com/joaotavora/sly/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#architecture\n[10]: https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa\n[11]: https://github.com/joaotavora/sly-named-readtables\n[12]: https://github.com/joaotavora/sly-macrostep\n[13]: https://github.com/joaotavora/sly-quicklisp\n[14]: https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode\n[documentation]: http://joaotavora.github.io/sly\n[tutorial]: http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/#A-SLY-tour-for-SLIME-users\n\n<!-- Local Variables: -->\n<!-- fill-column: 80 -->\n<!-- End: -->\n'
