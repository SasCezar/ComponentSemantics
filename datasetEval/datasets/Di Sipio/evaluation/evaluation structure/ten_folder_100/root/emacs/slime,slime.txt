b'[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/slime/slime/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/slime/slime) [![MELPA](http://melpa.org/packages/slime-badge.svg?)](http://melpa.org/#/slime) [![MELPA Stable](http://stable.melpa.org/packages/slime-badge.svg?)](http://stable.melpa.org/#/slime)\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nSLIME is the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs.\n\nSLIME extends Emacs with support for interactive programming in Common\nLisp. The features are centered around slime-mode, an Emacs minor-mode that\ncomplements the standard lisp-mode. While lisp-mode supports editing Lisp\nsource files, slime-mode adds support for interacting with a running Common\nLisp process for compilation, debugging, documentation lookup, and so on.\n\nFor much more information, consult [the manual][1].\n\n\nQuick setup instructions\n------------------------\n\n  1. [Set up the MELPA repository][2], if you haven\'t already, and install\n     SLIME using `M-x package-install RET slime RET`.\n\n  2. Add the following lines to your `~/.emacs` file, filling in in\n     the appropriate filenames:\n\n     ```el\n     ;; Set your lisp system and, optionally, some contribs\n     (setq inferior-lisp-program "/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl")\n     (setq slime-contribs \'(slime-fancy))\n     ```\n\n  3. Use `M-x slime` to fire up and connect to an inferior Lisp. SLIME will\n     now automatically be available in your Lisp source buffers.\n\nIf you\'d like to contribute to SLIME, you will want to instead follow\nthe manual\'s instructions on [how to install SLIME via Git][7].\n\n\nContribs\n--------\n\nSLIME comes with additional contributed packages or "contribs".\nContribs can be selected via the `slime-contribs` list.\n\nThe most-often used contrib is `slime-fancy`, which primarily installs a\npopular set of other contributed packages. It includes a better REPL, and\nmany more nice features.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSLIME is free software. All files, unless explicitly stated otherwise, are\npublic domain.\n\n\nContact\n-------\n\nIf you have problems, first have a look at the list of\n[known issues and workarounds][6]. \n\nQuestions and comments are best directed to the mailing list at\n`slime-devel@common-lisp.net`, but you have to [subscribe][3] first. The\nmailing list archive is also available on [Gmane][4].\n\nSee the [CONTRIBUTING.md][5] file for instructions on how to contribute.\n\n\n\n\n[1]: http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/\n[2]: http://melpa.org/#/getting-started\n[3]: http://www.common-lisp.net/project/slime/#mailinglist\n[4]: http://news.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.slime.devel\n[5]: https://github.com/slime/slime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n[6]: https://github.com/slime/slime/issues?labels=workaround&state=closed\n[7]: http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Installation.html#Installing-from-Git\n'
