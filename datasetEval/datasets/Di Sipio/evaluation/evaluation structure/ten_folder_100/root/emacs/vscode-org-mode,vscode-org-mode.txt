These can be modified in your `keybindings.json` file.\n\n### Custom TODO Keywords\n\nTODO keywords can be customized in `settings.json`. For example:\n```json\n"org.todoKeywords": [\n    "TODO",\n    "DONE",\n    "WAIT",\n    "SCHD"\n]\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nOrg Mode can be installed in a number of ways:\n  - Launch VS Code Quick Open (Linux / Windows: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>; Mac: <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) and type `ext install org-mode`.\n  - Search for `org mode` in the `Extensions` view in VS Code.\n\n![install](images/screenshots/14_install.gif)\n\n## Activation\n\nThe extension can be activated in two ways:\n1. Save a file with the extension `.org`.\n2. Change the language mode to `Org` by either\n    - Clicking in the lower right corner to the left of the smiley face\n    - Typing `change language mode` into the command palette\n    - Using the default shortcut\n        - Linux / Windows: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd> <kbd>m</kbd>\n        - Mac: <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd> <kbd>m</kbd>\n\n## Docs\n\nDetailed documentation is kept in the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/vscode-org-mode/vscode-org-mode/wiki).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to the GitHub repo. Here are basic guidelines for conventions.\n\n### Naming\n\nThe full name of this project is `VS Code Org Mode`. It is abbreviated `vscode-org-mode`. In the VS Code Marketplace, it is listed as `Org Mode`.\n\nCommands are prefixed with `org.` and followed by camel case, eg `org.insertHeadingRespectContent`. Command titles are prefixed with `Org: ` and followed by capitalized words separated by spaces, eg `Org: Insert Heading Respect Content`.\n\nFilenames use kebab case, eg `header-functions.ts`.\n\nWhen referring to the original Org mode, we capitalize the "O" and leave the "m" lower case. This is in keeping with the original team\'s usage on [orgmode.org](http://orgmode.org/).\n\n### Code\n\nUse TSLint with default settings.\n\n### Git\n\n- `master` is used for production deploys.\n- `develop` is the main branch into which new features are merged. It is protected from direct pushes, so all changes come from pull requests.\n- Features: For all new additions, create a new feature branch. When complete, create a pull request into `develop` for that branch. Optionally, prefix feature branch names with `feature/`.\n\n## Gratitude\n\nThe original Org mode was written for Emacs by Carsten Dominik, with the help and support of [an impressive list of geniuses](http://orgmode.org/org.html#History-and-Acknowledgments). Our work is inspired by though not associated with their original masterpiece. In addition, many aspects of the extension were inspired by [the Spacemacs Org layer](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Bemacs/org).\n\nOur unicorn icon is based on an image by [M. Turan Ercan](https://thenounproject.com/mte/) for [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/). We\'re grateful to them for making the image available under the Creative Commons license.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is available under the [GNU General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).\n\n## Requirements\n\nInstall the extension. The rest will be taken care of.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n### Colorization\n\nColorization, bolding, italicization, and other modes of highlighting are handled differently by different themes. We have prioritized supporting the default VS Code themes (Dark+ and Light+). This prioritization means that some colors may not appear as expected in other themes, or that opportunities for more variance have been missed.\n\n### Others\n\nSee [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vscode-org-mode/vscode-org-mode/issues).\n\n## Release Notes\n\nSee [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/vscode-org-mode/vscode-org-mode/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md).\n'
