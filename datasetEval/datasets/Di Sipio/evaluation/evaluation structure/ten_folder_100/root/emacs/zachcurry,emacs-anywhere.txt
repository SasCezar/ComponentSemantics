Make sure your Emacs server is running. You can start the server like this\n```\nemacs --daemon\n```\n2. Focus an application window\'s text input. A text area in your browser will do.\n3. Key the keyboard shortcut you\'ve chosen for **Emacs Anywhere** \n4. Write some text\n5. Delete the frame (`C-x 5 0`, or `:q` if you use evil-mode).\n**Emacs Anywhere** will copy the text from the buffer "\\*Emacs Anywhere\\*" to clipboard, delete the\nbuffer, switch focus to the window from step two and paste the buffers content into the text input.\n\n## Environment\nThe `EA_EDITOR` environment variable can be used to override the way\n**emacsclient** is run. For example, you could put the following statement into\nyour `.bash_profile`.\n```\nexport EA_EDITOR=\'emacsclient -a "" -c\'\n```\nWith the environment variable set, the invocation will look like this under the\nhood\n```\nemacsclient -a "" -c -e <elisp code>\n```\nYou can prefix **emacsclient** with it\'s path if **Emacs Anywhere** can\'t find\nit in your `PATH` environment variable.\n\n## Commands\n| Command       | Description                                                                                  |\n| ----          | -----------                                                                                  |\n| **toggle-ea** | If toggled to the "off" state, **Emacs Anywhere** will do nothing when the frame is deleted. |\n\n## Variables\n| Variable            | Description                                                                                                                 |\n| --------            | -----------                                                                                                                 |\n| **ea-on**           | Boolean where `t` and `nil` denote the "on" and "off** states of **Emacs Anywhere**, respectively.
