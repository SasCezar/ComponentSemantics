b'#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil\n\n** hrs\'s dotfiles\n\nI hope you like fiddling with your =.emacs.d= ad nauseam, \'cause I obviously do.\n\nI\'m currently running [[https://www.debian.org/][Debian]] on a 3rd-gen Lenovo X1 Carbon. I use the [[https://i3wm.org/][i3 window\nmanager]], [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/][Firefox]], and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].\n\nYou\'re probably here for my literate [[./emacs/.emacs.d/configuration.org][Emacs config]]! Most of my time is spent in\neither Emacs or Firefox. I think a text editor is just a terrific environment\nfor editing text, so I use Emacs for all kinds of things that "normal" people\nuse specialized tools for, including:\n\n- Task management and general writing with [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]],\n- Email browsing with [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]], backed by:\n  - [[http://isync.sourceforge.net/][mbsync]] for synchronization over IMAP,\n  - [[https://marlam.de/msmtp/][msmtp]] for sending messages over SMTP,\n  - [[https://github.com/djcb/mu][mu]] for managing a local searchable index,\n  - [[https://gnupg.org/][gpg]] for encryption and signatures,\n  - [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/][org-contacts]] for managing contacts and addresses, and\n  - [[https://www.fastmail.com][Fastmail]] for hosting,\n- RSS feed reading and management with [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]] and [[https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org][elfeed-org]], with keybindings\n  to send articles to [[https://www.instapaper.com/][Instapaper]] to read on my phone later,\n- Music playing with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/][EMMS]], backed by [[https://www.musicpd.org/][mpd]],\n- Git with [[https://magit.vc/][magit]], and\n- File management with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] and [[https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async][async]].\n\nThere\'s also a lot of programming-specific configuration in there. I write a lot\nof Ruby, but there\'s plenty of other stuff in there.\n\nI also use some non-Emacs tools! I like:\n\n- [[https://git.pwmt.org/pwmt/zathura][zathura]] as a PDF viewer,\n- [[https://feh.finalrewind.org/][feh]] as my image viewer,\n- [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] for password management,\n- [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][rofi]] for launching applications, and to use with a few custom scripts,\n- [[https://mpv.io/][mpv]] and [[https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/][youtube-dl]] for watching videos,\n- [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][calibre]] for managing books and syncing to my Kindle, and\n- a hodgepodge of [[https://www.signal.org/][Signal]], [[https://telegram.org/][Telegram]], [[https://www.skype.com/en/][Skype]], [[https://zoom.us/][Zoom]], and [[https://slack.com/][Slack]] for synchronous\n  communication. I can\'t say I really /like/ any of them, aside from Signal\n  (most of the time), but network effects mean the matter\'s mostly out of my\n  hands.\n\nThis whole repository isn\'t /really/ intended for anyone\'s use but my own, and\nof course it\'s catered to my way of doing things, so, you know, be prepared for\nthat.\n\nEnjoy! =)\n\n*** Installation\n\nClone this thing wherever you like (I use =~/.dotfiles=) and run the\n=install.sh= script. That will:\n\n- Install a bunch of Debian packages,\n- Set up a bunch of symlinks in your home directory (e.g., =~/.bashrc= \xe2\x86\x92\n  =~/.dotfiles/bash/.bashrc=), and\n- Install a handful of required Ruby gems.\n\nIt (mostly) won\'t overwrite existing files, so move those out of the way first.\n\n*** Wallpaper\n\nTo ensure that wallpaper is set correctly, create a =~/.wallpaper-directory=\nsymlink to the directory where you keep your wallpapers:\n\n#+begin_src\n$ ln -s /where/your/wallpapers/live ~/.wallpaper-directory\n#+end_src\n'
