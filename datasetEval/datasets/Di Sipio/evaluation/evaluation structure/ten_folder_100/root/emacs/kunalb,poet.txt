b'# poet [![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/poet-theme-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/poet-theme)\nA light emacs theme that\'s well suited for prose: particularly org-mode and markdown-mode; or any mode that works well with `variable-pitch` mode.\n\n## Motivation\nThe main idea behind this was to make Emacs more friendly for writing prose instead of code. Highlights include mixing monospace and variable pitch text in markdown and org-modes, making it convenient to write prose and code together. I wrote a  about building poet at https://explog.in/notes/poet.html.
