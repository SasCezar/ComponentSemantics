This means minimal -- and ideally zero -- configuration with absolutely no stored indexes (TAGS) or persistent background processes. Dumb Jump requires at least GNU Emacs `24.3`.\n\n\n#### How  it works\nDumb Jump uses [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) `ag`, [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) `rg`, or `grep` to find potential definitions of a function or variable under point. It uses a set of regular expressions based on the file extension, or `major-mode`, of the current buffer. The matches are run through a shared set of heuristic methods to find the best candidate to jump to. If it can\'t decide it will present the user with a list in a pop-menu, helm, or ivy (see `dumb-jump-selector`).\n\n#### Success Rate\nFor the currently [supported languages](#supported-languages) it seems to do a good job of finding what you want. If you find a case where it does not work as expected do not hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump/issues). It can be slow if it needs to use `grep` and/or a project is large. Although it can be sped up by [installing `ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher#installing) or [installing `rg`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) and/or creating a `.dumbjump` file in your project\'s root directory with paths that should be excluded ([see configuration](#configuration)).\n\n\n## Supported Languages\n\nThere is currently basic support for the following languages:\n\n* Bash\n* C/C++\n* C#\n* Clojure\n* CoffeeScript\n* Common Lisp\n* Coq\n* Crystal\n* Elixir\n* Emacs Lisp\n* Erlang\n* F#\n* Faust\n* Fortran\n* Go\n* Groovy\n* Haskell\n* Java\n* JavaScript\n* Julia\n* Kotlin\n* LaTeX\n* Lua\n* Matlab\n* Nim\n* Nix\n* Objective-C\n* OCaml\n* OpenSCAD\n* Pascal\n* Perl\n* PHP\n* Protocol Buffers\n* Python\n* R\n* Racket\n* Ruby\n* Rust\n* SML\n* Scala\n* Scheme\n* SQL\n* Swift\n* SystemVerilog\n* TypeScript\n* Vala\n* VHDL\n\n\nIf you have any issues with the existing languages, or you want support for another one, then please [open an issue](https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump/issues). PRs are also welcome. If you\'d like to add a language these PRs for [lua](https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump/pull/33) and [rust](https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump/pull/57) are good examples.\n\n## Installing\n\nThe recommended way to install Dumb Jump is via `package.el`. It\'s available on [MELPA](http://melpa.org/#/dumb-jump): <kbd>M-x</kbd> `package-install dumb-jump`\n\n#### Spacemacs\n\nIf you\'re using an up-to-date Spacemacs, then you already have Dumb Jump by default just make sure you install `ag` or `rg` (see below) to ensure you have the best experience.\n\n\n#### Installing `ag` or `rg`\n\nDumb Jump performs best with The Silver Searcher `ag` ([ag install instructions](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher#installing)) or ripgrep `rg` ([rg install instructions](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)) installed on your system.\n\n## Usage\n\n#### Basic\n\nAdding `(dumb-jump-mode)` to your `.emacs` will enable the key bindings for two interactive Dumb Jump functions:\n\n* `dumb-jump-go` <kbd>C-M-g</kbd> core functionality. Attempts to jump to the definition for the thing under point\n* `dumb-jump-back` <kbd>C-M-p</kbd> jumps back to where you were when you jumped. These are chained so if you go down a rabbit hole you can get back out or where you want to be.\n* `dumb-jump-quick-look` <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> like `dumb-jump-go` but **only** shows tooltip with `file`, `line`, and `context` it does not jump.\n* `dumb-jump-go-other-window` exactly like `dumb-jump-go` but uses `find-file-other-window` instead of `find-file`\n* `dumb-jump-go-prefer-external` like `dumb-jump-go` but will prefer definitions not in the current buffer\n* `dumb-jump-go-prefer-external-other-window` expected combination of `dumb-jump-go-prefer-external` and `dumb-jump-go-other-window`\n* `dumb-jump-go-prompt` exactly like `dumb-jump-go` but prompts user for function to jump to instead of using symbol at point\n\n## Configuration\n\n##### Excluding project directories\n\nDumb Jump will automatically look for a project root. If it\'s not finding one then either put a `.dumbjump` file in your project root and optionally add excluded directories to make it faster.\n\nProject root directory denoters: `.dumbjump` `.projectile` `.git` `.hg` `.fslckout` `.bzr` `_darcs` `.svn` `Makefile` `PkgInfo` `-pkg.el`.\n\nIf you want to stop a directory from registering as the project root (and have Dumb Jump keep looking) add an empty `.dumbjumpignore` file in that directory.\n\n##### Example `.dumbjump`\n\n    -tests\n    -node_modules\n    -build\n    -images\n    +../some-lib/src\n    +/usr/lib/src\n\n*NOTE* When adding paths outside of the project (using `+`) ensure you use `dumb-jump-force-searcher` of either `\'ag` or `\'rg` (see below). This is required because the default searcher (`git-grep`) won\'t be able to search outside of the project root. This edge case will be fixed in a future release. That is, `git-grep` will NOT be set as the default searcher if a `.dumbjump` is present with a `+` path outside of the repo.\n\n##### `.emacs` options\n\n* `(setq dumb-jump-default-project "~/code")` to change default project if one is not found (defaults to `~`)\n* `(setq dumb-jump-quiet t)` if Dumb Jump is too chatty.\n* `(setq dumb-jump-confirm-jump-to-modified-file nil)` to avoid being prompted for confirmation if you attempt to jump to a file that has been modified and not saved.  This defaults to `t` because jumping to modified files results in you jumping to a location that may no longer be current.\n* To support more languages and/or definition types customize `dumb-jump-find-rules` variable.\n* `(add-hook \'dumb-jump-after-jump-hook \'some-function)` to execute code after you jump\n* `(setq dumb-jump-selector \'ivy)` to use [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#ivy) instead of the default popup for multiple options.\n* `(setq dumb-jump-selector \'helm)` to use [helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) instead of the default popup for multiple options.\n* `(setq dumb-jump-force-searcher \'rg)` to force the search program Dumb Jump should use. It will _always_ use this searcher. If not set (`nil`) Dumb Jump will use `git-grep` if it\'s a git project and if not will try searchers in the following order `ag`, `rg`, `grep` (first installed wins). This is necessary if you want full control over the searcher Dumb Jump uses.\n* `(setq dumb-jump-aggressive nil)` to only automatically jump if there\'s only one match and otherwise present you with a list. This defaults to `t`, which means it will try its best to guess where you want to jump and only if it can\'t then give you a list of matches.\n* `(setq dumb-jump-use-visible-window nil)` if `t` (the default) when you\'re using multiple windows/panes and the file to jump to is already open in one of those windows then dumb jump will focus that window and jump there instead of within your current window.\n* `(setq dumb-jump-prefer-searcher \'rg)` to let Dumb Jump know your searcher preference. If set this will still use `git-grep` if it\'s a git project (because it\'s the fastest), but will you use whatever you set here in any other situation. If not set Dumb Jump will follow the same order as mentioned in the `dumb-jump-force-searcher` description. At this time setting this value is only necessary if you prefer `rg` but have `ag` installed too.\n* `(setq dumb-jump-git-grep-search-args "")` to set additional command line arguments when using git-grep for searching (defaults to `""`).\n* `(setq dumb-jump-ag-search-args "")` to set additional command line arguments when using ag for searching (defaults to `""`).\n* `(setq dumb-jump-rg-search-args "")` to set additional command line arguments when using rg for searching (defaults to `"--pcre2"`).\n\n#### If your project has multi-line method signatures [you should use `ag`](https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump/issues/129) or [`rg` with a version higher than `0.10`](https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump/issues/255).\n\nTo learn more about how Dumb Jump picks a searcher see [this issue](https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump/issues/109) and this [pull request](https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump/pull/111).\n\n\n##### `use-package` example configuration.\n\nI personally no longer use the `dumb-jump-mode` keybindings that were inspired by IntelliJ\'s emacs bindings. I use [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) like so:\n\n```el\n(use-package dumb-jump\n  :bind (("M-g o" . dumb-jump-go-other-window)\n         ("M-g j" . dumb-jump-go)\n         ("M-g b" . dumb-jump-back)\n         ("M-g i" . dumb-jump-go-prompt)\n         ("M-g x" . dumb-jump-go-prefer-external)\n         ("M-g z" . dumb-jump-go-prefer-external-other-window))\n  :config (setq dumb-jump-selector \'ivy) ;; (setq dumb-jump-selector \'helm)\n  :ensure)\n```\n\n##### Hydra for effieciency\n\nIf you have [Hydra](https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra) installed, the following is an example hydra for easily using Dumb-Jump and not needing to remember the bindings or function names:\n\n```el\n(defhydra dumb-jump-hydra (:color blue :columns 3)\n    "Dumb Jump"\n    ("j" dumb-jump-go "Go")\n    ("o" dumb-jump-go-other-window "Other window")\n    ("e" dumb-jump-go-prefer-external "Go external")\n    ("x" dumb-jump-go-prefer-external-other-window "Go external other window")\n    ("i" dumb-jump-go-prompt "Prompt")\n    ("l" dumb-jump-quick-look "Quick look")\n    ("b" dumb-jump-back "Back"))\n```\n\nIt can be explicitly bound or used inside another hydra (if you already use something like [Avy](https://github.com/abo-abo/avy)/[Ace](https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode) or similar for general "jumping").\n\n#### Debugging a jump\n\n1. <kbd>M-x</kbd> `set-variable dumb-jump-debug t`\n1. try to jump\n1. go to buffer `*Messages*`\n\nMore details [here](http://p.cweiske.de/506). Thanks to @cweiske and @Glumanda99\n\n## Why?\n\nI wanted "jump to definition" functionality to "just work" in emacs. I use IntelliJ for Java and this functionality is basically the only thing I miss when I switch back to emacs for work in other languages. There are certainly other packages that offer this type of functionality, but they all require significantly more configuration and are often limited to a particular language. An alternative may be worth setting up if you are in a specific project or language often (see [alternatives](#alternatives)).\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeedback is very welcome via GitHub issues. I will consider supporting other languages either via issue request or PR. If submitting a PR then please add tests as well.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nOpening a PR will use CircleCI to run all the tests against all the supported emacs versions and search programs.\n\n### Running tests locally\n\nThere are a lot of options for running the tests locally:\n\n#### Basic/Classic\nrequires [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) using your local emacs\n```sh\ncd /path/to/dumb-jump\ncask\nmake test\n```\n\n#### Concurrent\nrequires golang and [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) using your local emacs\n```sh\ncd /path/to/dumb-jump\ncask\nmake test-concurrent\n```\n\n#### Docker (latest emacs)\nonly requires docker and runs tests against emacs 26.1\n```sh\ncd /path/to/dumb-jump\ncask\nmake test-in-docker\n```\n\n#### Docker (all supported emacs versions)\nonly requires docker and runs tests against all supported emacs versions\n```sh\ncd /path/to/dumb-jump\ncask\nmake test-all-in-docker\n```\n\n\n## Alternatives\n\nHere is a list of potential alternative packages for emacs:\n\n* [Tags](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Tags-Tables.html) supports multiple languages\n* [GNU Global](http://www.gnu.org/software/global/) supports multiple languages\n* [Tern](http://ternjs.net/) for JavaScript\n* [elpy](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy) for Python\n* [robe](https://github.com/dgutov/robe) for Ruby\n\nMost of these were sourced from this [emacs StackExchange answer](http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/10125/can-emacs-support-go-to-declaration-of-function-in-an-entire-project).\n'
