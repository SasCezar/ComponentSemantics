b'#+TITLE: Ox-Hugo: A carefully crafted Org exporter back-end for Hugo\n#+AUTHOR: Kaushal Modi\n[[https://travis-ci.org/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo][https://travis-ci.org/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo.svg?branch=master]] [[https://melpa.org/#/ox-hugo][file:https://melpa.org/packages/ox-hugo-badge.svg]] [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0][https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg]]\n\n[[https://gitter.im/KaushalModi/Lobby][https://badges.gitter.im/KaushalModi/Lobby.svg]] [[https://saythanks.io/to/kaushalmodi][https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-!-1EAEDB.svg]]\n\n=ox-hugo= is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to\n[[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]-compatible Markdown ([[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][Blackfriday]]) and also generates the\nfront-matter (in TOML or YAML format).\n\nThe =ox-hugo= backend extends from a /parent/ backend\n=ox-blackfriday.el=. The latter is the one that primarily does the\nBlackfriday-friendly Markdown content generation. The main job of\n=ox-hugo= is to generate the front-matter for each exported content\nfile, and then append that generated Markdown to it.\n\nThere are, though, few functions that =ox-hugo.el= overrides over\nthose by =ox-blackfriday.el=.\n\n-----\nSee the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/examples/][Real World Examples]] section to quickly jump to sites generated\nusing =ox-hugo= and their Org sources.\n* Table of Contents\n- [[#screenshots][Screenshots]]\n- [[#documentation][Documentation]]\n  - [[#source-of-the-documentation-site][Source of the Documentation site]]\n- [[#demo][Demo]]\n- [[#installation][Installation]]\n- [[#usage][Usage]]\n  - [[#before-you-export][Before you export]]\n  - [[#export-bindings][Export bindings]]\n  - [[#customization-options][Customization Options]]\n- [[#changelog][Changelog]]\n- [[#thanks][Thanks]]\n\n* Screenshots\nBefore you read further, you can see below how =ox-hugo= translates\nOrg to Markdown (Org on the left; exported Markdown with Hugo\nfront-matter on the right).\n** One post per Org subtree (preferred)\n[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/static/images/one-post-per-subtree.png][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/static/images/one-post-per-subtree.png]]\n- Files in above screenshot :: [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/test/site/content-org/screenshot-subtree-export-example.org][Org]] -> [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/test/site/content/writing-hugo-blog-in-org-subtree-export.md][Markdown]]\n** One post per Org file\n[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/static/images/one-post-per-file.png][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/static/images/one-post-per-file.png]]\n- Files in above screenshot :: [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/test/site/content-org/writing-hugo-blog-in-org-file-export.org][Org]] -> [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/test/site/content/writing-hugo-blog-in-org-file-export.md][Markdown]]\n** Editorial\nThe preferred way to organize the posts is as Org subtrees (also the\nmain reason to write this package, as nothing like that was out there)\nas it makes the meta-data management for Hugo front-matter pretty\neffortless.\n\nIf you are a /one Org-file per post/ type of a person, that flow works\ntoo! Just note that in this flow many of those =#+hugo_= properties\nneed to be managed manually.. just as one would manage the front-matter\nin Markdown files --- See the Org versions in the above screenshots for\ncomparison.\n* Documentation\n=ox-hugo= uses *itself* to generate its documentation!\n\nhttps://ox-hugo.scripter.co/\n\nYou can generate the same too!

The test site is designed to verify if all the\ncontent translates from Org to Markdown as expected.\n\n/See [[https://themes.gohugo.io/][Hugo Themes]] for examples of really good site prettification and\npresentation styles./\n\n* Installation\nThis package requires emacs 24.4+ and Org 9.0+. It is available on\nMelpa ([[https://melpa.org/#/ox-hugo]]).\n* Usage\nOnce the package is installed, you will need to /require/ it so that\nthe =ox-hugo= export options are available in the /Org Export\nDispatcher/ menu (the one you see when you hit =C-c C-e= to initiate\nany export).\n\nYou can do that by adding the below to your config:\n#+begin_src emacs-lisp\n(with-eval-after-load \'ox\n  (require \'ox-hugo))\n#+end_src\nIf you use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][=use-package=]], you can do the below instead:\n#+begin_src emacs-lisp\n(use-package ox-hugo\n  :ensure t            ;Auto-install the package from Melpa (optional)\n  :after ox)\n#+end_src\n\nAlso see the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/auto-export-on-saving/][Auto Exporting]] section.\n\n*Spacemacs*\n\nSpacemacs users can choose to add this snippet to their\n=dotspacemacs/user-config= function in =.spacemacs=:\n\n#+begin_src emacs-lisp\n(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()\n  ;; Other stuff\n  ;; ..\n\n  ;; ox-hugo config\n  (use-package ox-hugo\n    :ensure t          ;Auto-install the package from Melpa (optional)\n    :after ox))\n#+end_src\n\n#+begin_note\nYou do have _have_ to use the =use-package= version when using\nSpacemacs. That version was used because =use-package= is installed by\ndefault in Spacemacs.\n#+end_note\nIf you do so, you *also need to* add =ox-hugo= to\n=dotspacemacs-additional-packages=.\n\n/This was verified to work on Spacemacs =develop= branch with\n=spacemacs-base= distribution, =emacs= editing style. --\n<2017-10-09 Mon>/\n** Before you export\nBefore you export check that these properties are set as you need:\n- HUGO_SECTION :: The default Hugo section name for all the posts.  See\n     [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/][here]] for more information on Hugo sections.  It is\n     common for this property to be set to =posts= or\n     =blog=.  The default value is set using\n     =org-hugo-default-section-directory=. See\n     [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/hugo-section/][Hugo Section]] for details.\n- HUGO_BASE_DIR :: Root directory of the source for the Hugo site. If\n     this is set to =~/hugo/=, the exported Markdown\n     files will be saved to\n     =~/hugo/content/<HUGO_SECTION>/=\n     directory[fn:-1-section_more].  By default, the\n     Markdown files reside in a hierarchy under the\n     =content/= directory in the site root directory\n     ([[https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/][ref]]). If you try to export without setting this\n     property, you will get this error:\n     #+begin_example\n       user-error: It is mandatory to set the HUGO_BASE_DIR property\n     #+end_example\n\n*Important*: If you choose to export an Org subtree as a post, you\n need to set the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= subtree property. That property is\n used by this package to figure out where the current post starts.\n\n[fn:-1-section_more] The ~HUGO_SECTION~ is the bare-minimum requirement\nto specify the destination path. That path can be further tweaked\nusing ~HUGO_BUNDLE~ key (and the associated ~EXPORT_HUGO_BUNDLE~\nproperty), and the ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*~ property (only for\n/per-subtree/ exports).\n** Export bindings\nThe common =ox-hugo= export bindings are:\n*** For both one-post-per-subtree and one-post-per-file flows\n- =C-c C-e H H= :: Export "What I Mean".\n  - If point is in a /valid Hugo post subtree/, export that\n    subtree to a Hugo post in Markdown.\n\n    A /valid Hugo post subtree/ is an Org subtree that has the\n    =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property set.\n  - If the file is intended to be exported as a whole (i.e. has the\n    =#+title= keyword), export the whole Org file to a Hugo post in\n    Markdown.\n- =C-c C-e H A= :: Export *all* "What I Mean"\n  - If the Org file has one or more \'valid Hugo post subtrees\', export\n    them to Hugo posts in Markdown.\n  - If the file is intended to be exported as a whole (i.e. no \'valid\n    Hugo post subtrees\' at all, and has the =#+title= keyword), export\n    the whole Org file to a Hugo post in Markdown.\n*** For only the one-post-per-file flow\n- =C-c C-e H h= :: Export the Org file to a Hugo post in Markdown.\n** Customization Options\nDo =M-x customize-group=, and select =org-export-hugo= to see the\navailable customization options for this package.\n* Changelog\n** v0.8 <2018-01-26 Fri>\n*** Features\n- Support exporting content files and attachments (images, documents)\n  to Page Bundles organization structure (Hugo v0.32+) --\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/111][111]].\n- Support exporting =resources= front-matter (Hugo v0.33+) --\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/115][115]].\n- Support exporting =headless= front-matter (Hugo v0.35+).\n- Advanced table styling is now possible by specifying =#+attr_html=\n  and =#+attr_css= (this one is unique to =ox-hugo=) above Org\n  tables. See its [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/table-styling/][documentation]] -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/93][93]].\n  - Similarly, support =#+attr_html= and =#+attr_css= for paragraphs,\n    example blocks, source blocks, plain lists and quote blocks too --\n    #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/113][113]].\n- Now =publishDate= and =expiryDate= front-matter properties get\n  auto-derived from =SCHEDULED= and =DEADLINE= special properties if\n  associated with the valid Hugo post subtree --\n  commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/0807f42d][0807f42d]].\n  - Date values can now be easily set using the =C-c .= binding in the\n    =HUGO_PUBLISHDATE= and =HUGO_EXPIRYDATE= properties too.\n- Export source blocks and table captions -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/38][38]]. Here\'s a\n  suggested CSS for the captions:\n  #+begin_src css\n    figcaption,\n    .src-block-caption,\n    .table-caption {\n        font-style: italic;\n        text-align: center;\n    }\n  #+end_src\n- Export descriptive or definition lists in Blackfriday-friendly\n  Markdown format -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/114][114]].\n- Support Org Special Blocks like in HTML and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-blocks-in-LaTeX-export.html][LaTeX exports]] --\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/105][105]]. Here\'s one little example:\n  #+begin_src org\n    ,#+begin_mark\n    /Some/ *marked* text\n    ,#+end_mark\n  #+end_src\n- Allow setting =:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION:= in the valid Hugo post subtree\n  itself.\n- Enable replacing any key in the front-matter with anything; it\'s\n  even possible to swap the keys now (tags\xe2\x86\x94categories:\n  commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/fb21e82c][fb21e82c]]). New keyword:\n  =HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_KEY_REPLACE= -- see commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/b72a5fb0][b72a5fb0]].\n- Now all the Org keyword values that should get merged, get merged --\n  commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/38eba6d5][38eba6d5]].\n- Add =title= as a valid property of =menu= front-matter (Hugo\n  v0.32+).\n*** Backward-incompatible changes\n- A "better user-experience" change.. now you do not need to use\n  /double-underscores/ as /space/ replacement in =#+hugo_tags=,\n  =#+hugo_categories= and =#+keywords=. See this commit for details\n  and examples -- commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/319435db][319435db]].\n*** Fixes\n- Fix =HUGO_LEVEL_OFFSET= not getting set -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/117][117]], thanks\n  @[[https://github.com/shimmy1996][*shimmy1996*]]!\n- Fix internal subtree counter not getting reset after a file-based\n  export.\n- Fix clickable image links with =#+name= -- commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/fef0ec50][fef0ec50]].\n- Make title text rendering more robust.. now Markdown markup\n  characters like =*=, =_= and =`= show up fine, verbatim, in the\n  title.\n- Make em dash, en dash, horizontal ellipsis render in post titles\n  too -- Hugo #[[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4175][4175]] (/Upstream bug fix/), and in source\n  block captions and table captions too.\n- Fix double-escaping of =#= and =![= in Markdown export --\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/110][110]] (/fix in upstream =ox-md.el=/).\n*** Meta\n- Re-write the logic for parsing meta-data for various kinds of dates,\n  and optimize the logic for parsing newline separated lists like tags\n  and categories.\n- The =hugo-bare-min-theme= used for the test site is made more\n  portable (at some point, that theme might be moved to a separate\n  repo).\n** v0.7 <2017-12-18 Mon>\n*** Features\n- *Now C-c C-e H H works for both per-subtree and per-file flows* --\n  commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/b1b5d28b][b1b5d28b]].\n- Support Org heading based internal links -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/88][88]].\n- Support list values for custom front-matter variables --\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/99][99]].\n- Support specifying multiple [[https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/][hugo output formats]] .. Now the =outputs=\n  front-matter variable is a list.\n- Support the Org =#+author= and =#+creator= keywords and their\n  respective Org Export Options -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/106][106]].\n- Support Org Export Snippets and Export Blocks --\n  commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/1149f20cd][1149f20cd]].\n- Now post titles can be set to =nil= i.e. be not be a part of the\n  front-matter .. /because you can/.\n- Improve the messages printed by =ox-hugo= on doing per-subtree or\n  per-file exports.. the progress of files exported using per-subtree\n  flow is now clearer, and the name of the file exported using\n  per-file flow is now explicit.. Helps when you batch export a dozen\n  files with a mix of these 2 flows.\n*** Backward-incompatible changes\n- Obsolete /org-hugo-export-subtree-\\ast{}/ functions and replace them with\n  /org-hugo-export-wim-\\ast{}/ (What I Mean) functions. See the doc string\n  of =org-hugo-export-wim-to-md= for details.\n\n  If you are using the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/auto-export-on-saving/][Auto-export on saving]] flow, note the function\n  name change there too!\n*** Fixes\n- Fix number of backticks in code fence when code contains code fence\n  (/pathological corner case/).\n- Better document the =HUGO_CODE_FENCE= keyword -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/102][102]].\n- Don\'t render =(c)=, =(r)=, =(tm)= inside Latex equations --\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/104][104]] (/Upstream bug workaround/).\n- Better recognition of TOML-compatible integers and floats in meta\n  data for front-matter so that valid integers/floats don\'t get\n  unnecessarily double-quoted.\n*** Meta\n- Add a [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-debugprint/blob/master/layouts/partials/debugprint.html][=debugprint.html=]] partial to help pretty-print various Hugo\n  objects like Page Params, File and SiteInfo for debug on the test\n  site.\n- The test site now has [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/tags/][tags]] and [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/categories/][categories]] pages.\n- Add few real world example posts containing complex Latex equations:\n  [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/real-examples/multifractals-in-ecology-using-r/][1]], [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/real-examples/nn-intro/][2]].\n- Turns out =ox-hugo= works on emacs 24.4 too (/but please upgrade\n  to the latest Emacs and Org stable versions!/).\n** v0.6 <2017-11-09 Thu>\n*** Features\n- Support the =num= export option. Now you can prefix all post\n  headings (or some not.. the ones with =UNNUMBERED= property set to\n  =t=) with their section numbers -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/76][76]].\n- Org TOC\'s are now exported as unordered Markdown lists. This allows\n  having TOC\'s with unnumbered headings too! This also enables\n  prefixing the section headings with their full section numbers, and\n  also having only selected headings unnumbered (both in the post body\n  and the TOC).\n- Add support for exporting internal links to source blocks, tables\n  and images by their block names! -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/29][29]].\n- Org table column alignment markers (=<l>=, =<r>=, =<c>=) are now\n  exported to equivalent Markdown tables.. so a center-aligned column\n  in Org buffer will remain center-aligned in the final HTML too! --\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/95][95]].\n- Allow setting multiple Hugo aliases for a post. Also infer the\n  section name from inherited =HUGO_SECTION= values (subtree-based\n  exports) for those alias prefixes.\n- Prevent a footnote ref to appear by itself on a newline (based on\n  wrapping) in the browser -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/96][96]].\n- If Hugo shortcodes are used specifically in Markdown (=md=) source\n  blocks, they will be auto-escaped (useful when you want to\n  document/talk about some Hugo shortcode in a blog post) --\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/94][94]].\n- If an Org table has just 1 row, don\'t make it render as a header row\n  in the final HTML.\n- If you have a case where you need to have an Org source block\n  instead a quote block, and then a source block after that quote\n  block (/I know, a very common case../ :wink:), Blackfriday barfs\n  (Blackfriday #[[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday/issues/407][407]]). But we now have a workaround, which /just\n  works/ -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/98][98]].\n- Now =ATTR_HTML= above even hyper-linked images works (earlier it\n  worked only above non-hyper-linked images).\n*** Backward-incompatible changes\n- Org TOC\'s are exported as unordered Markdown lists instead of\n  ordered Markdown lists, and now full section numbers (like 1.2.3)\n  are shown in the TOC instead of just the last digit (like 3.) --\n  commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/4be378e7][4be378e7]].\n- The =num= Org export option is default to =nil= (only for\n  =ox-hugo=). So Org TOC\'s are exported without section numbers by\n  default. To get section numbers, set =num= to =t= or =onlytoc=.\n*** Fixes\n- Now exporting 1-row Org tables works too.\n- Add missing http/https/ftp prefix for hyper-linked images.\n*** Meta\n- Add documentation on how you can have\n  [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/images-in-content/][Images live in the same directory as Org source]] -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/91][91]].\n- Now only Org files for the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][documentation site]] need to be committed\n  to git. =ox-hugo= then exports those to Markdown, and then Hugo\n  publishes those to HTML (as before) --- all on Netlify.\n- Be sure to check out the moderately revamped [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/][Test Site]]. That might\n  be of interest even if you want to check out what the new features\n  and changes look like, without first installing/updating =ox-hugo=\n  yourself :smile:.\n** v0.5 <2017-11-06 Mon>\n*** Features\n- Export TOC as a Markdown ordered list. See [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/org-toc/][Table of Contents]] -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/88][88]].\n- =#+attr_html= above http/https/ftp links is now supported (useful\n  for specifying the =target=, =rel=, attributes, for example).\n** v0.4.1 <2017-10-29 Sun>\n*** Features\n- Support specifying the =:height= parameter in the =#+attr_html=\n  above image links. That eventually gets transformed to the =height=\n  parameter in the =figure= tag in the HTML generated by Hugo. This\n  feature requires building Hugo from its master branch with commit\n  [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/488631fe0abc3667355345c7eb98ba7a2204deb5][488631fe]] (or Hugo v0.31+).\n*** Fixes\n- Fix =EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION= not getting inherited #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/90][90]].\n** v0.4 <2017-10-28 Sat>\n*** Backward-incompatible changes\n- Restore the default Org behavior of =#+tags=. Now that keyword (and\n  the =EXPORT_TAGS= property) is *not* used by =ox-hugo=. Fixes\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/89][89]].\n- File-based exports must now use =#+hugo_tags= to set the post tags.\n- Subtree-based exports can use the =EXPORT_HUGO_TAGS= property to\n  override Org-style tags on the same headline (and the ones inherited\n  from Org-style tags from any of the parent subtrees and\n  =#+filetags=).\n  - Note that for subtree-based exports, =#+filetags= can be used to\n    set tags globally in the file. Earlier =#+tags= was used for that\n    purpose.\n- Subtree-based exports can use the =EXPORT_HUGO_CATEGORIES= property\n  to override Org-style categories (tags with "@" prefix) on the same\n  headline (and the ones inherited from Org-style categories from any\n  of the parent subtrees and =#+filetags=).\n  - Note that for subtree-based exports, =#+filetags= can be used to\n    set categories (tags with "@") globally in the file.\n\nSee the new section added to documentation:\n[[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/tags-and-categories/][*Tags and Categories*]]\n*** Features\n- Support specifying the =:width= parameter in the =#+attr_html= above\n  image links. That eventually gets transformed to the =width=\n  parameter in the =figure= tag in the HTML generated by Hugo.\n** v0.3.2 <2017-10-24 Tue>\n*** Fixes\n- Fix issue with headline metadata parsing (ALLTAGS, CLOSED, TODO)\n  when a post Org heading was immediately followed by that post\'s\n  sub-heading.  This issue was seen in subtree-based exports\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/87][87]].\n** v0.3.1 <2017-10-19 Thu>\n*** Fixes\n- Fix the source block line number annotation when the line numbers\n  increased in number of digits in the same code block.\n** v0.3 <2017-10-18 Wed>\n*** Features\n- Source blocks can now be exported with line numbers and/or\n  highlighting!\n\n  See [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/source-blocks/][Source Blocks]] for details.\n** v0.2.3 <2017-10-11 Wed>\n*** Fixes\n- =org-hugo-slug= earlier stripped off only the =code= HTML tag\n  (~<code> .. </code>~) from the input string, if present. Now it does\n  that for *any* HTML tag, like =span=. For example, this HTML gets\n  stripped off from the above heading (only inside =org-hugo-slug=\n  when deriving the slug string): ~<span\n    class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2017-10-11\n    Wed&gt;</span></span>~.\n** v0.2.2 <2017-10-10 Tue>\n*** Backward-incompatible changes\n- Now =ox-hugo= by default requires text, to be sub/super-scripted, to\n  be wrapped in ={}=. So now =a_b= will be exported as =a_b=, but\n  =a_{b}= will be exported as =a<sub>b</sub>=. To revert back to the\n  earlier behavior, user needs to add =#+options: ^:t= to their Org\n  file.\n** v0.2.1 <2017-09-28 Thu>\n*** Fixes\n- Single column tables now export correctly #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/84][84]].\n- Ignore =HUGO_WEIGHT= set to =auto= for /per-file/ exports\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/83][83]].\n** v0.2 <2017-09-27 Wed>\n*** Features\n- Add support for all Hugo =figure= shortcode parameters\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/79][79]].\n- New option =org-hugo-delete-trailing-ws= defaults to =t=; now Hugo\n  deletes trailing white-spaces by default.\n- New options =org-hugo-default-static-subdirectory-for-externals= and\n  =org-hugo-external-file-extensions-allowed-for-copying= (related to\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/69][69]]).\n*** Fixes\n- Remove =HUGO_STATIC_IMAGE= option; fix attachment re-write\n  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/69][69]].\n- Fix incorrectly inserted hard line-breaks #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/72][72]]. Added a\n  new option =HUGO_PRESERVE_FILLING=.\n- Fix error happening when a post title was set to an empty string\n  [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/ba9e8365f6ee42f030ed806bf5ec42d6acce4c76][ba9e8365]]].\n*** Backward-incompatible changes\n- Switch the default value of =org-hugo-use-code-for-kbd= option to\n  =nil= [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/88ba15ae9bc809b0983315446c88fecfda3534e5][88ba15ae]]].\n** v0.1.3 <2017-09-13 Wed>\n- Now a HUGO key value set to ="nil"=, like =#+hugo_code_fence: nil=,\n  will evaluate as /nil/ instead of /t/, as now\n  =org-hugo--plist-get-true-p= is used to parse boolean keys instead\n  of =plist-get=.\n** v0.1.2 <2017-09-12 Tue>\n- Make DateTime matching better; new internal variable\n  =org-hugo--date-time-regexp=. Earlier time zones ahead of UTC (with\n  =+= sign) were not detected as dates in =org-hugo--quote-string= and\n  thus were unnecessarily quoted.\n** v0.1.1 <2017-09-11 Mon>\n- Use CLOSED log drawer info if available to set the date in\n  front-matter #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/68][68]].\n- Code optimization: Use of =org-entry-get= at places instead of\n  maintaining global variables.\n* Thanks\n- Matt Price ([[https://github.com/titaniumbones][@titaniumbones]])\n- Puneeth Chaganti ([[https://github.com/punchagan][@punchagan]])\n- Also thanks to\n  ~http://whyarethingsthewaytheyare.com/setting-up-the-blog/~ (/not\n  hyperlinking the link as it is insecure --- not https/),\n  ~http://www.holgerschurig.de/en/emacs-blog-from-org-to-hugo/~ (/not\n  hyperlinking the link as it is insecure --- not https/) and the\n  [[https://github.com/chaseadamsio/goorgeous][=goorgeous=]] project by Chase Adams ([[https://github.com/chaseadamsio][@chaseadamsio]]) for inspiration\n  to start this project.\n'
