The application has familiar key-bindings ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][Emacs]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)][VI]]), is fully\nconfigurable and extensible in Lisp, and has powerful features for\nproductive professionals.\n\nIf you like Next and if you want to help future development, please\nsupport us on [[https://www.patreon.com/next_browser][Patreon]]!\n\n*Warning:* Next is under active development.  Feel free to [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/issues][report]] bugs,\ninstabilities or feature wishes.\n\n-----\n\n#+html: <div align="center"> <a href="http://next.atlas.engineer/"><b>Homepage</b></a> | <a href="https://next.atlas.engineer/download"><b>Downloads</b></a> | <a href="https://next.atlas.engineer/documentation"><b>User Manual</b></a> | <a href="https://next.atlas.engineer/articles"><b>Articles</b></a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/next_browser/"><b>Reddit</b></a> | Freenode IRC: <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/#next-browser">#next-browser</a> </div>\n\n-----\n\n** Fast tab switching\nSwitch easily between your open tabs by fuzzy search. If you are\nlooking for ~https://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~,\n~epl~, or any other matching series of letters.\n\n#+html: <img src="https://next.atlas.engineer/static/image/tab_switch.gif" align="center"/>\n\n** History as a tree\nHistory is represented as a tree that you can traverse. smarter than\nthe "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers, the tree\nmakes sure  you never lose  track of where  you\'ve been.\n\n** Multiple selection\nCommands can accept multiple input, allowing you to quickly perform an\noperation against multiple tabs.\n\n#+html: <img src="assets/next-multiple-selection.png" align="center"/>\n\n** Powerful Bookmarks\nBookmark a page with tags. Search bookmarks with compound\nqueries. Capture more data about your bookmarks, and group and wrangle\nthem in any way you like.\n\n** Lightning fast navigation\nNext is lightweight and fast. The interface does not get in your way-\neverything can be done by keyboard. You are free to fully focus on\nyour task.\n\n#+html: <img src="https://next.atlas.engineer/static/image/fast_navigation.gif" align="center"/>\n\n* Getting started\n** Install Next\n\nNext supports GNU/Linux, macOS, and Guix with engine support for\nWebKit and WebEngine/Blink.\n\nPlease see the [[https://next.atlas.engineer/download][downloads]] page for pre-built binaries.
