b'#+TITLE: scimax - Awesome editing for scientists and engineers\n#+AUTHOR: John Kitchin\n\nScimax is an Emacs starterkit for scientists and engineers. It provides a comprehensive configuration of Emacs for scientific programming and publishing.\n\nSee the [[./scimax.org][manual]] for more details.\n\n#+BEGIN_HTML\n<a href="https://travis-ci.org/jkitchin/scimax"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/jkitchin/scimax.svg?branch=master"></a>\n<a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jkitchin/scimax"><img src="https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/j5bvj8j4le1yvjsx?svg=true"></a>\n<a href=\'https://coveralls.io/github/jkitchin/scimax?branch=master\'><img src=\'https://coveralls.io/repos/github/jkitchin/scimax/badge.svg?branch=master\' alt=\'Coverage Status\' /></a>\n<a href="https://gitter.im/scimax-users"><img src="https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png"></a>\n#+END_HTML\n\n* NEWS\n\n** <2018-02-28 Wed> scimax 2.0\n\nIt is an update of scimax, and the main new features are:\n\n1. Major overhaul on ipython. See [[./scimax-ipython.org]].\n2. A dashboard feature: [[./scimax-dashboard.el]]\n3. A new inkscape link: [[./scimax-inkscape.el]]\n4. You can put images on links with images in the description: [[./scimax-link-thumbnails.el]]\n5. Functional text: [[./scimax-functional-text.el]]\n\nAnd probably more.\n\n* Installation\n\n** Windows users\n\nInstall git (http://git-scm.com/download/win). Open a git bash terminal. Run this command.\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC sh\nbash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkitchin/scimax/master/install-scimax-win.sh)"\n#+END_SRC\n\nThere is an emacs 25.2 binary in this repository for Windows. You should be able to run the scimax.sh command to launch scimax now.\n\n** Mac users\n\nRun the next command in your terminal in the location you want to install scimax. The command will make sure you have [[http://brew.sh][homebrew]], git, and emacs installed, and then will clone scimax and tell you how to use it. It will take some time to install. You need to install your own Python and LaTeX. These days I am using [[https://www.continuum.io/downloads][Python3 from Continuum IO]] and MacTeX from http://www.tug.org/mactex.\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC sh\nbash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkitchin/scimax/master/install-scimax-mac.sh)"\n#+END_SRC\n\n*** Alternative manual installation of scimax for Mac users\n\nAlternatively, you can install [[http://brew.sh][homebrew]] yourself, install git from http://git-scm.com/download/mac, build your emacs like this:\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC sh\nbrew install emacs --with-gnutls --with-imagemagick --with-librsvg --with-x11 --use-git-head --HEAD --with-cocoa\n#+END_SRC\n\nAlternatively, lately I have been using emacs-plus which claims to be faster for magit and has all those options enabled by default.\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC sh\nbrew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus\nbrew install emacs-plus\n#+END_SRC\n\nThis got me:\n#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :result org drawer :export results\n(emacs-version)\n#+END_SRC\n\n#+RESULTS:\n: GNU Emacs 25.2.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin16.5.0, NS appkit-1504.82 Version 10.12.4 (Build 16E195))\n:  of 2017-04-25\n\n\n\nAfter that, I clone scimax like this:\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC sh\ngit clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax.git\n#+END_SRC\n\nand launch emacs with:\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC sh\nemacs -q -l scimax/init.el\n#+END_SRC\n\n** Linux users\nRun this command. It checks for a git and emacs, but does not install them. You will have to use your package manager for that. You also need to install your own LaTeX and Python (and other languages you might want).\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC sh\nbash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkitchin/scimax/master/install-scimax-linux.sh)"\n#+END_SRC\n\n** Manual installation\n\nYou can use your own emacs if you have one (version 25 or more is recommended). You still have to install Python and LaTeX if you will be using those.\n\nClone the scimax repo where you want it.\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC sh\ngit clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax.git\n#+END_SRC\n\nand launch emacs with:\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC sh\nemacs -q -l path/to/scimax/init.el\n#+END_SRC\n\nAlternatively, add scimax to your load path in your init file and just require what you want.\n\n#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp\n(setq scimax-dir "path/to/scimax")\n(add-to-list \'load-path "path/to/scimax")\n#+END_SRC\n\nIt is not uncommon to have to restart emacs a few times while all the packages from MELPA are installed. Windows seems to be like that.\n'
