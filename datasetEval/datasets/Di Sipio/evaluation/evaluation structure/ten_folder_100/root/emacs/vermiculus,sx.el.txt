Using the official\nAPI, it provides a versatile experience for the Stack Exchange network within\nEmacs itself.\n\n[[file:list-and-question.png]]\n\n* Features\nAs always, =C-h m= is the definitive resource for functionality, but here are a\nfew highlights:\n** Viewing Questions\n*** Question Lists\nView questions with one of the ~sx-tab-~ commands.  These translate roughly to\nthe different \'tabs\' that you can view on the official site.  Implemented tabs\ninclude:\n\n- ~sx-tab-all-questions~      :: All questions.\n- ~sx-tab-unanswered~         :: =u= Unanswered questions.\n- ~sx-tab-unanswered-my-tags~ :: =U= Unanswered questions in your followed tags.\n- ~sx-tab-featured~           :: =f= Featured questions.\n- ~sx-tab-starred~            :: =*= Your starred questions.\n- ~sx-tab-frontpage~          :: =h= The frontpage of the site.\n- ~sx-tab-meta-or-main~       :: =m= Toggle between the meta and main sites.\n- ~sx-tab-newest~             :: =n= Newest questions first.\n- ~sx-tab-topvoted~           :: =v= Highest-scoring questions first.\n- ~sx-tab-week~               :: =w= Hot questions of the week.\n\nInside SX buffers, you can switch to other tabs by typing =s= followed by the key\nlisted with the tab above.  You can also use ~sx-tab-switch~ (=s t=) to switch\nbetween tabs with completion.  Each of these opens up a list of questions, and\nyou can further customize the ordering of the list with =O=.  Other keys\ninclude:\n\n- =n= and =p= :: Navigate the list.\n- =j= and =k= :: Navigate while viewing the question in a separate buffer.\n- =s s= :: Switch site.\n- =v= :: Visit the ~thing-at-point~ in your browser.\n- =w= :: Copy the ~thing-at-point~ (usually a link).\n- =u= and =d= :: Upvote and downvote.\n- =RET= :: Open the question buffer.\n\n*** Questions and Answers\n- =u= and =d= :: Upvote and downvote the question, answer, or comment at point.\n- =a= :: Add an answer.\n- =e= :: Edit the question or answer (or comment if it\'s yours; the usual rules\n         apply)\n- =*= :: Star the question.\n- =K= :: Delete the question/answer/comment if you are able.\n- =w= :: Copy code at point.\n\n** Your Inbox\n- ~sx-inbox~ :: View your inbox\n- ~RET~ :: Visit inbox item\n\n* Installation\nSX is now available on MELPA!  Both the stable release and the development\nversion can be found there.  Install it via the Package Menu or just run\n#+BEGIN_SRC text\nM-x package-install RET sx RET\n#+END_SRC\n\n** Authenticating\nIf you are going to be doing any\nasking/answering/commenting/upvoting/downvoting/ /etc./, you must use\n~sx-authenticate~ to provide SX with an authentication token to act on your\nbehalf.\n\nAfter authentication, you will be redirected to the project page.  This page\nwill prominently display your authentication token. *Keep this secret!* It\'s as\ngood as your password as far as StackExchange is concerned.  Copy and paste the\ntoken into the prompt in Emacs.\n\n#+BEGIN_QUOTE\nSX will store this authentication token in plain text in the =sx= folder of\nyour =.emacs.d=.  Please take any and all steps necessary to protect the\nsecurity of your account.  This token is as good as a password.\n#+END_QUOTE\n\n** Sample Keybindings\n*** With =use-package=\n#+BEGIN_SRC elisp\n  (require \'use-package)\n\n  (use-package sx\n    :config\n    (bind-keys :prefix "C-c s"\n               :prefix-map my-sx-map\n               :prefix-docstring "Global keymap for SX."\n               ("q" . sx-tab-all-questions)\n               ("i" . sx-inbox)\n               ("o" . sx-open-link)\n               ("u" . sx-tab-unanswered-my-tags)\n               ("a" . sx-ask)\n               ("s" . sx-search)))\n#+END_SRC\n*** Standard (With Prefix Key)\nShamelessly stolen from [[http://endlessparentheses.com/sx-el-announcement-and-more-launcher-map.html][Endless Parentheses]].\n#+BEGIN_SRC elisp\n(define-prefix-command \'launcher-map)\n(global-set-key (kbd "s-l") \'launcher-map)\n(define-key launcher-map "qq" #\'sx-tab-all-questions)\n(define-key launcher-map "qi" #\'sx-inbox)\n(define-key launcher-map "qo" #\'sx-open-link)\n(define-key launcher-map "qu" #\'sx-tab-unanswered-my-tags)\n(define-key launcher-map "qa" #\'sx-ask)\n(define-key launcher-map "qs" #\'sx-search)\n#+END_SRC\n\n* Contributing\nPlease help contribute!
