[[http://jacek.zlydach.pl/blog/2011-08-25-introducing-nyan-mode-el-turn-your-emacs-into-nyanmacs.html][Read the story so far]]! :).\n\n[[file:screenshot.png]]\n\nNyan Mode is an analog indicator of your position in the buffer. The\nCat should go from left to right in your mode-line, as you move your\npoint from 0% to 100%.\n\n** Features\n   - *NEW!* You can scroll the buffer by clicking in the Nyan Cat area!\n   - *NEW!* You can customize the minimum window width below which Nyan Mode will be disabled.\n   - Mind dumbing content included,\n   - Animation (=M-x nyan-start-animation=, =M-x nyan-stop-animation=),\n   - Wavy rainbow (=M-x nyan-toggle-wavy-trail=),\n   - Music, mplayer is needed (=M-x nyan-start-music=, =M-x nyan-stop-music=) (thanks, George Leontiev!),\n   - Customizable properties.\n\n** Customizations\n\n   - =nyan-animate-nyancat= - =t= to have it animated, =nil= for a static version.\n   - =nyan-animation-frame-interval= - number of seconds between animation frames. Accepts fractional values.\n   - =nyan-bar-length= - length of nyan-mode bar, in 8px-wide units.\n   - =nyan-cat-face-number= - choose a cat face for the console mode.\n   - =nyan-wavy-trail= - =t= to make the trail wavy; works even better when animation is enabled!\n   - =nyan-minimum-window-width= - minimum width of the window, below\n     which Nyan Mode will be disabled. This is important because Nyan\n     Mode will otherwise push out more relevant information from the\n     modelilne.\n\n** Using Nyan Mode with custom modeline\nFor those who were asking, or are planning to, [[http://web.archive.org/web/20120131133230/http://friendfeed.com/amitp/b4097da0/nyan-mode-turn-your-emacs-into-nyanmacs][Amit Patel shared]]\nsome tips on how to make nyan-mode work with custom modeline.\n\nHe changed his mode-line-format to appear like the following:\n#+begin_src emacs-lisp\n(setq mode-line-format\n      (list\n       \'(:eval (list (nyan-create)))\n       ))\n#+end_src\n\n** Known issues\nIt\'s my second attempt to write a minor mode in Emacs, so there will\ndefiniely be some bugs.\n\nThis version uses XPM images, which should be supported by default by\nmost Emacs 23 installations, Windows included. In case it doesn\'t\nwork, try switching to master-png branch. This branch, however, may\nhave it\'s own issues:\n\nThere was a problem with displaying PNG images, which require libpng\nto be available for Emacs. The lib is sometimes missing (e.g. some\nWindows installation). To make it work on Windows, one needs to\ndownload a proper DLL and put it into emacs bin/ folder. To see which\nDLL is needed, do: =M-x describe-variable <ret> image-library-alist <ret>=.\n\n+Customizing nyan-animate-nyancat is broken; don\'t do it.+\nI think it works now; please report issues if there are problems with it.\n\n** Credits\nThanks to everyone contributing patches, bug repots and ideas! The Emacs world is forever in your debt!\n\nCode and idea inspired by sml-modeline.el, written by Lennart Borgman.\nSee: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~nxhtml/nxhtml/main/annotate/head%3A/util/sml-modeline.el\n\nFor animated Nyan Cat, I used frames [[http://media.photobucket.com/image/nyan%20cat%20sprites/DryBowser455/th_NyanCatSprite.png?t=1304659408][by DryBowser455]].\n\n** Other editors\nFor many years only the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][One True Editor]] was blessed with the presence\nof the Nyan Cat. Since its inception, however, daring souls have brought\nNyanness to the lands of Lesser Editors.\n\nHere are the examples I\'ve tracked down so far:\n\n- Vim - nefo-mi\'s [[https://github.com/nefo-mi/nyan-modoki.vim][nyan-modoki.vim]] (text-only, it seems)\n- Vim - edvb54\'s [[https://github.com/edvb54/catium.vim][catium.vim]] (also text, apparently)\n- Sublime Text - wiggin15\'s [[https://github.com/wiggin15/SublimeNyan][SublimeNyan]]\n- Atom - dz\'s [[https://github.com/dz/atom-nyancat][atom-nyancat]]\n- qutebrowser - [[https://github.com/jgkamat/qutenyan][qutenyan]]\n\nIf you\'ve seen others in the wild, please submit.\n\n** Related\n\nCheck out Aaron Miller\'s [[https://github.com/aaron-em/weatherline-mode.el][weatherline.el]], partially inspired by Nyan Mode.\n\nAlso check out [[https://github.com/wasamasa/zone-nyan][zone-nyan]] by Vasilij Schneidermann if you want the Nyan\nCat to visit your Emacs when you step away from the keyboard!\n\nNyanyanyanyanyanyanya! \xe2\x99\xac \xe2\x99\xab \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xa9\n'
