b"* My personal Emacs configuration\nHacking journey begins start from 2013.\n\nIt was written for Emacs 25.1+ on MacOS 10.11+\n\n** How to use\nFollow the install instruction here: https://github.com/zilongshanren/spacemacs#install ,\nmake sure your are using the fork repo: https://github.com/zilongshanren/spacemacs\n\nWhy use the forked repo?  What's the difference between the forked repo and the original repo?\n\n*Nothing difference!*\n\nThe forked version is only a few commits behind the original repo, becuase sometimes the original repo can't functional well.\n\n** What's the highlight of this configuration\n1. It's a highly optimized Spacemacs configuration, you should use the configuration together with the *develop* branch of the forked Spacemacs.\n2. I prefer to the =Ivy= completion interface, so I removed many helm related packages but keep the =helm-ag= package. The =counsel-ag= counterpart is not powerful as =helm-ag=.\n3. I also removed some packages I don't have any chance to use. The complete list lies in the exclude section of the =init.el= file.\n4. I also exclude the =Spaceline= package, cause it's easy to frozen the Emacs with this package enabled. So I create my own mode line configuration based on =Spaceline=.\n5. The =Swiper= package sometimes frozen the Emacs UI when you split the window with very long lines. You could use `pkill -SIGUSR2 -i emacs` in command line to save the frozen Emacs.\n\n** Optional    \n*** Install Imagemagick \n\n** Happing Hacking\n"
