A stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic\nvimmer -- envious of the features of modern text editors -- spirals into despair\nbefore succumbing to the [dark side][url:evil-mode]. This is his config.\n\nDoom is a configuration for [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)\ndesigned to make Emacs faster and easier to customize. It can serve as framework\nfor your own configuration or a resource for fellow Emacs enthusiasts who want\nto learn more about our favorite OS.\n\n## Doom\'s mantras\n\n- **Gotta go fast.** Startup and run-time performance are high priorities.\n  Expensive functionality (built-in or in plugins) is modified and optimized\n  toward this end, otherwise, they must be opt-in.\n- **Close to metal.** There\'s less between you and vanilla Emacs, by design.\n  There\'s less to grok. Modules should be syntactically sweet and backend logic\n  explicit and abstraction-light. The code itself ought to be designed as if\n  grokking it were part of the user experience; and it is!\n- **Opinionated, but not stubborn.** Doom is a bundle of reasonable defaults\n  and curated opinions, but you aren\'t stuck with it. Use as little or as much\n  of it as you like. Use it as-is as a complete Emacs distribution; disable\n  everything and use it as a baseline for your own; or anywhere in between.\n- **Your system, your rules.** There are more ways to set up your programming\n  environment than there are dislikes on Youtube Rewind \'18, so Doom and its\n  plugins promise not to *automatically* (and definitely not *silently*) install\n  system dependencies. This means fonts, packages and programs. `doom doctor`\n  will tell you what\'s missing though!\n\n## Features\n\n- A curated set of sane defaults for all packages, all (major) OSes, and Emacs\n  itself.\n- Support for *many* programming languages. Too many to list. Includes syntax\n  highlighting, linters/checker integration, inline code evaluation, code\n  completion (where possible), REPLs, documentation lookups, snippets, and more!\n- Support for *many* tools, like docker, pass, ansible, terraform, and more.\n- Minimalistic good looks inspired by modern editors.\n- A modular architecture for a more organized Emacs configuration.\n- A custom elisp library to help you simplify your config.\n- A declarative [package management system][doom:packages] (powered by\n  [straight.el][url:straight]) with a command line interface. Install packages\n  from anywhere, not just (M)ELPA.\n- Vim-emulation powered by [evil-mode][url:evil-mode], including ports of\n  popular vim plugins and functionality.\n- A Spacemacs-esque [keybinding scheme][doom:bindings], centered around leader\n  and localleader prefix keys (<kbd>SPC</kbd> and <kbd>SPC</kbd><kbd>m</kbd>, by\n  default).\n- A rule-based [popup management system][doom:popups] that dictates how\n  temporary or disposable buffers are displayed (and disposed of).\n- Automatic indentation detection and [editorconfig][url:editorconfig]\n  integration. Let someone else argue about tabs vs **\\_\\***spaces**\\*\\_**.\n- Project-management tools and framework-specific minor modes with their own\n  snippets libraries.\n- Project search (and replace) utilities, powered by\n  [the_silver_searcher][url:the_silver_searcher] or [ripgrep][url:ripgrep].\n- Isolated and persistent workspaces (also substitutes for vim tabs).\n- An environment variables file generator and loader, so that Emacs can\n  perfectly inherit your shell configuration.\n- Everything is optional!\n\n# Getting Help\n\n## Community\n\nWe have [a Discord server][url:discord]! Hop on and say hi!\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nEncountered strange behavior or an error? Here are some things to try before you\nshoot off that bug report:\n\n- Run `bin/doom refresh`. This ensures Doom is properly set up and its autoloads\n  files are up-to-date.\n- If you have byte-compiled your config (with `bin/doom compile`), see if\n  `bin/doom clean` makes the issue go away. Never debug issues with a\n  byte-compiled config, it will make your job harder.\n- Run `bin/doom doctor` to detect common issues in your development environment.\n- Search Doom\'s issue tracker for mention of any error messages you\'ve received.\n- [Visit our FAQ][docs:faq] to see if your issue is listed.\n\nIf all else fails, [file that bug report][github:new-issue]! Please include the\nbehavior you\'ve observed, the behavior you expected, and any error messages or\nwarnings logged to the \\*Messages\\* buffer (can be opened with <kbd>SPC h\ne</kbd> or `M-x view-echo-area-messages`).\n\nIt\'s a great help if you included a backtrace with errors, i.e. `M-x\ntoggle-debug-on-error` then recreating the error(s).\n\n## Contributing\n\nDoom (and my Emacs work in general) is a labor of love and incurable madness,\ndone on my spare time. If you\'d like to support my work, there are many things\nyou can do to help; I welcome any contribution!\n\n- I love pull requests and bug reports. Check out the [Contributing\n  Guidelines][docs:contributing] to find out how you can help out.\n- I welcome Elisp pointers! Don\'t hesitate to [tell me my Elisp-fu\n  sucks][github:new-issue] (but please tell me why).\n- Hop on [our Discord server][url:discord] and say hi! Help others out, hang out\n  or talk to me about Emacs, or gamedev, or programming, machine learning,\n  physics, pixel art, anime, gaming -- anything you like. Nourish this lonely\n  soul!\n- If you\'d like to support my work financially, consider buying me a drink\n  through [liberapay][url:liberapay] or [paypal][url:paypal]. Donations are a\n  great help. My work here contends with studies, ventures in indie gamedev, and\n  my freelance work.\n\n[docs:wiki]: docs/index.org\n[docs:wiki-quickstart]: docs/getting_started.org\n[docs:wiki-modules]: docs/index.org#Module%20List\n[docs:wiki-customization]: docs/getting_started.org#Customize\n[docs:contributing]: docs/contributing.org\n[docs:faq]: docs/faq.org\n[github:new-issue]: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues/new\n[doom:bindings]: modules/config/default/+evil-bindings.el\n[doom:packages]: core/autoload/packages.el\n[doom:popups]: modules/ui/popup/README.org\n[url:discord]: https://discord.gg/bcZ6P3y\n[url:liberapay]: https://liberapay.com/hlissner/donate\n[url:paypal]: https://paypal.me/henriklissner/10\n[url:editorconfig]: http://editorconfig.org/\n[url:evil-mode]: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil\n[url:ripgrep]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep\n[url:the_silver_searcher]: https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher\n[url:straight]: https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el\n'
