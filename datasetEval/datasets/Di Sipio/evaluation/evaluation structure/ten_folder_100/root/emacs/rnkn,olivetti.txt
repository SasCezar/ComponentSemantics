b'# Olivetti #\n\nA simple Emacs minor mode for a nice writing environment.\n\nScreenshot: https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/pwr-share/olivetti.png\n\n## Features ##\n\n- Set a desired text body width to automatically resize window margins to\n  keep the text comfortably in the middle of the window.\n- Text body width can be the number of characters (an integer) or a fraction\n  of the window width (a float between 0.0 and 1.0).\n- Interactively change body width with:  \n  olivetti-shrink C-c { { { ...  \n  olivetti-expand C-c } } } ...  \n  olivetti-set-width C-c \\\n- If olivetti-body-width is an integer, the text body width will scale with\n  use of text-scale-mode, whereas if a fraction (float) then the text body\n  width will remain at that fraction.\n- Optionally remember the state of visual-line-mode on entry and recall its\n  state on exit.\n\nOlivetti keeps everything it does buffer-local, so you can write prose in one\nbuffer and code in another, side-by-side in the same frame. For those looking\nfor a hardcore distraction-free writing mode with a much larger scope, I\nrecommend writeroom-mode: https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode.\n\n## Requirements ##\n\n- Emacs 24.5\n\n## Installation ##\n\nThe latest stable release of Olivetti is available via [MELPA-stable]\nand can be installed with:\n\n    M-x package-install RET olivetti RET\n\nAlternately, download the [latest release], move this file into your\nload-path and add to your .emacs/init.el file:\n\n    (require \'olivetti)\n\nIf you prefer the latest but perhaps unstable version, install via\n[MELPA], or clone the repository into your load-path and require as\nabove:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti.git\n\n[melpa]: https://melpa.org/#/olivetti "MELPA"\n[melpa-stable]: https://stable.melpa.org/#/olivetti "MELPA-stable"\n[latest release]: https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti/releases/latest "Olivetti latest release"\n\n## Contributing ##\n\nPlease report bugs and request features at:\nhttps://github.com/rnkn/olivetti/issues\n\n## Hints ##\n\nTo always use a different width for a specific file, set a File\nVariable:\n\n    M-x add-file-local-variable RET olivetti-body-width RET 66 RET\n\nSee (info "(emacs) File Variables")\n'
