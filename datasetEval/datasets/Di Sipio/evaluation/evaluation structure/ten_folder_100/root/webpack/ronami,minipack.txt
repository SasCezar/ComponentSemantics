b'## \xf0\x9f\x93\xa6 Minipack\n\n> A simplified example of a modern module bundler written in JavaScript\n\n### Introduction\n\nAs front-end developers, we spend a lot of time working with tools like [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [Browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify), and [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel).\n\nUnderstanding how those tools work can help us make better decisions on how we write our code. By understanding how our code turns into a bundle and how that bundle looks like we can also debug it better.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to explain how most bundlers work under the hood. It contains a short implementation of a simplified but still reasonably accurate bundler. Along with the code, there are comments explaining what the code is trying to achieve.\n\n### Cool, where do I start?\n\nHead on to the source code: [src/minipack.js](src/minipack.js).\n\n### Try running the code\n\nStart by installing dependencies:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install\n```\n\nAnd then run our script:\n\n```sh\n$ node src/minipack.js\n```\n\n### Additional links\n\n- [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net)\n- [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl)\n- [Babylon](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-parser)\n- [Babel Plugin Handbook](https://github.com/thejameskyle/babel-handbook/blob/master/translations/en/plugin-handbook.md)\n- [Webpack: Modules](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/modules)\n\n### Read this in other languages\n\n- [\xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb8\x80/Korean](https://github.com/hg-pyun/minipack-kr)\n- [\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87/Chinese](https://github.com/chinanf-boy/minipack-explain)\n- [\xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9/Russian](https://github.com/makewebme/build-your-own-webpack)\n'
