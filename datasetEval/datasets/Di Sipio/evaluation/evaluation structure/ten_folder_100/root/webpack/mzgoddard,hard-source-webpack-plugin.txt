b'# HardSourceWebpackPlugin\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mzgoddard/hard-source-webpack-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mzgoddard/hard-source-webpack-plugin) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/761saaelxem01xo5/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mzgoddard/hard-source-webpack-plugin/branch/master)\n\n`HardSourceWebpackPlugin` is a plugin for webpack to provide an intermediate caching step for modules. In order to see results, you\'ll need to run webpack twice with this plugin: the first build will take the normal amount of time. The second build will be signficantly faster.\n\nInstall with `npm install --save-dev hard-source-webpack-plugin` or `yarn add --dev hard-source-webpack-plugin`. And include the plugin in your webpack\'s plugins configuration.\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nvar HardSourceWebpackPlugin = require(\'hard-source-webpack-plugin\');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  context: // ...\n  entry: // ...\n  output: // ...\n  plugins: [\n    new HardSourceWebpackPlugin()\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nYou can optionally set where HardSource writes and reads its cache to and from, and the hash values that determine when it creates new caches.\n\n```js\nnew HardSourceWebpackPlugin({\n  // Either an absolute path or relative to webpack\'s options.context.\n  cacheDirectory: \'node_modules/.cache/hard-source/[confighash]\',\n  // Either a string of object hash function given a webpack config.\n  configHash: function(webpackConfig) {\n    // node-object-hash on npm can be used to build this.\n    return require(\'node-object-hash\')({sort: false}).hash(webpackConfig);\n  },\n  // Either false, a string, an object, or a project hashing function.\n  environmentHash: {\n    root: process.cwd(),\n    directories: [],\n    files: [\'package-lock.json\', \'yarn.lock\'],\n  },\n  // An object.\n  info: {\n    // \'none\' or \'test\'.\n    mode: \'none\',\n    // \'debug\', \'log\', \'info\', \'warn\', or \'error\'.\n    level: \'debug\',\n  },\n  // Clean up large, old caches automatically.\n  cachePrune: {\n    // Caches younger than `maxAge` are not considered for deletion. They must\n    // be at least this (default: 2 days) old in milliseconds.\n    maxAge: 2 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,\n    // All caches together must be larger than `sizeThreshold` before any\n    // caches will be deleted. Together they must be at least this\n    // (default: 50 MB) big in bytes.\n    sizeThreshold: 50 * 1024 * 1024\n  },\n}),\n```\n\nSome further configuration is possible through provided plugins.\n\n```js\n  plugins: [\n    new HardSourceWebpackPlugin(),\n```\n\n### ExcludeModulePlugin\n\n```js\n    // You can optionally exclude items that may not be working with HardSource\n    // or items with custom loaders while you are actively developing the\n    // loader.\n    new HardSourceWebpackPlugin.ExcludeModulePlugin([\n      {\n        // HardSource works with mini-css-extract-plugin but due to how\n        // mini-css emits assets, assets are not emitted on repeated builds with\n        // mini-css and hard-source together. Ignoring the mini-css loader\n        // modules, but not the other css loader modules, excludes the modules\n        // that mini-css needs rebuilt to output assets every time.\n        test: /mini-css-extract-plugin[\\\\/]dist[\\\\/]loader/,\n      },\n      {\n        test: /my-loader/,\n        include: path.join(__dirname, \'vendor\'),\n      },\n    ]),\n```\n\n### ParallelModulePlugin\n\n```js\n    // HardSource includes an experimental plugin for parallelizing webpack\n    // across multiple processes. It requires that the extra processes have the\n    // same configuration. `mode` must be set in the config. Making standard\n    // use with webpack-dev-server or webpack-serve is difficult. Using it with\n    // webpack-dev-server or webpack-serve means disabling any automatic\n    // configuration and configuring hot module replacement support manually.\n    new HardSourceWebpackPlugin.ParallelModulePlugin({\n      // How to launch the extra processes. Default:\n      fork: (fork, compiler, webpackBin) => fork(\n        webpackBin(),\n        [\'--config\', __filename], {\n          silent: true,\n        }\n      ),\n      // Number of workers to spawn. Default:\n      numWorkers: () => require(\'os\').cpus().length,\n      // Number of modules built before launching parallel building. Default:\n      minModules: 10,\n    }),\n  ]\n```\n\n\n## Options\n\n### `cacheDirectory`\n\nThe `cacheDirectory` is where the cache is written to. The default stores the cache in a directory under node_modules so if node_modules is cleared so is the cache.\n\nThe `cacheDirectory` has a field in it `[confighash]` that is replaced by the `configHash` option when webpack is started. The `[confighash]` field is here to help with changes to the configuration by the developer or by a script. For example if the same webpack configuration is used for the `webpack` cli tool and then the `webpack-dev-server` cli tool, they will generate different configuration hashes. `webpack-dev-server` adds plugins for its reloading features, and the default hash function produces a different value with those plugins added.\n\n### `configHash`\n\n<a name="using-confighash-in-the-cachedirectory"></a>\n<a name="why-hash-the-config"></a>\n\n`configHash` turns a webpack configuration when a webpack instance is started and is used by `cacheDirectory` to build different caches for different webpack configurations.\n\nConfigurations may change how modules are rendered and so change how they appear in the disk cache `hard-source` writes. It is important to use a different cache per webpack configuration or webpack cli tool. `webpack` and `webpack-dev-server` for example needed separate caches, `configHash` and `[confighash]` in the `cacheDirectory` will create separate caches due to the plugins and configuration changes `webpack-dev-server` makes.\n\nThe default value for `configHash` is\n\n```js\nconfigHash: function(webpackConfig) {\n  return require(\'node-object-hash\')({sort: false}).hash(webpackConfig);\n}\n```\n\nThis uses the npm `node-object-hash` module with sort set to false to hash the object. `node-object-hash` hashes as much as it can but may have issue with some plugins or plugins and loaders that load an additional configuration file like a babel rc file or postcss config. In those cases you can depend on `node-object-hash` and extend what it hashes to best cover those changes.\n\n`configHash` can also be set to a string or it can be a function that generates a value based on other parts of the environment.\n\n```js\nconfigHash: function() {\n  return process.env.NODE_ENV + \'-\' + process.env.BABEL_ENV;\n}\n```\n\n### `environmentHash`\n\nWhen loaders, plugins, other build time scripts, or other dynamic dependencies change, `hard-source` needs to replace the cache to make sure the output is correct. The `environmentHash` is used to determine this. If the hash is different than a previous build, a fresh cache will be used.\n\nThe default object\n\n```js\nenvironmentHash: {\n  root: process.cwd(),\n  directories: [],\n  files: [\'package-lock.json\', \'yarn.lock\']\n}\n```\n\nhashes the lock files for `npm` and `yarn`. They will both be used if they both exist, or just one if only one exists. If neither file is found, the default will hash `package.json` and the `package.json` under `node_modules`.\n\n<a name="environmenthash-as-a-function"></a>\n<a name="environmenthash-as-an-object"></a>\n\n<a name="environmenthash-disabled-with-false"></a>\n\nYou can disable the environmentHash by setting it to `false`. By doing this you will manually need to delete the cache when there is any dependency environment change.\n\n### `info`\n\nControl the amount of messages from hard-source.\n\n#### `mode`\n\nSets other defaults for info. Defaults to \'test\' when NODE_ENV===\'test\'.\n\n#### `level`\n\nThe level of log messages to report down to. Defaults to \'debug\' when mode is \'none\'. Defaults to \'warn\' when mode is \'test\'.\n\nFor example \'debug\' reports all messages while \'warn\' reports warn and error level messages.\n\n### `cachePrune`\n\n`hard-source` caches are by default created when the webpack configuration changes. Each cache holds a copy of all the data to create a build so they can become quite large. Once a cache is considered "old enough" that it is unlikely to be reused `hard-source` will delete it to free up space automatically.\n\n#### `maxAge`\n\nCaches older than `maxAge` in milliseconds are considered for automatic deletion.\n\n#### `sizeThreshold`\n\nFor caches to be deleted, all of them together must total more than this threshold.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Configuration changes are not being detected\n\n`hard-source` needs a different cache for each different webpack configuration. The default `configHash` may not detect all of your options to plugins or other configuration files like `.babelrc` or `postcss.config.js`. In those cases a custom `configHash` is needed hashing the webpack config and those other values that it cannot normally reach.\n\n### Hot reloading is not working\n\n`webpack-dev-server` needs a different cache than `webpack` or other webpack cli tools. Make sure your `cacheDirectory` and `configHash` options are hashing the changes `webpack-dev-server` makes to your webpack config. The default `hard-source` values should do this.\n\n### Multiple webpack processes at the same time are getting bad results\n\nIf you are using multiple webpack instances in separate processes make sure each has its own cache by changing `cacheDirectory` or `configHash`.\n\n### Rebuilds are slower than the first build during dev-server\n\nThis is can be due to module context dependencies. `require.context` or loaders that watch folders use this webpack feature so webpack rebuilds when files or folders are added or removed from these watched directories. Be careful about using `require.context` or context aware loaders on folders that contain a lot of items. Both `require.context` and context loaders depend on those folders recursively. `hard-source` hashes every file under a `require.context` or context loader folder to detect when the context has changed and dependent modules are rebuilt.\n\n### `webpack-dev-server` build loops continuously\n\nMake sure you don\'t have a `require.context` or context loader on the root of your project. Such a context module means webpack is watching the hard source cache and when the cache is written after a build, webpack will start a new build for that module. This normally does not happen with `webpack-dev-server` because it writes the built files into memory instead of the disk. `hard-source` cannot do that since that would defeat its purpose as a disk caching plugin.\n\n## Please contribute!\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have an idea for hard-source-webpack-plugin could be better, please let us know.\n\n# [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)\n'
