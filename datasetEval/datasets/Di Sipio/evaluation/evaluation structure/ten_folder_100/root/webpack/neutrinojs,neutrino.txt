It intends to make the process of\ninitializing and building projects much simpler by providing minimal development\ndependencies.\n\nNeutrino uses webpack to build both web and Node.js projects by providing\ncomplete build presets which can be shared across targets and projects. You can\nuse Neutrino base presets to get started building a variety of projects, create\nyour own presets by extending the Neutrino core ones to be shared across your\nown projects or even by the community. Presets can even be manipulated on a\nproject-by-project basis to handle almost any build situation your preset\ndoesn\'t cover.\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee the [Neutrino docs](https://neutrinojs.org/) for details on installation,\ngetting started, usage, and customizing.\n\n### Contributing\n\nThank you for wanting to help out with Neutrino!
