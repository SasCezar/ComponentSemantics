The plugin will collect stats whenever meaningful changes to bundle composition have occurred. Optionally launch analysis too to see how your bundles have changed over time!\n\n## Setup\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-monitor\n```\n\nin `webpack.config.js`\n```js\nconst WebpackMonitor = require(\'webpack-monitor\');\n\n// ...\n\nplugins: [\n  new WebpackMonitor({\n    capture: true, // -> default \'true\'\n    target: \'../monitor/myStatsStore.json\', // default -> \'../monitor/stats.json\'\n    launch: true, // -> default \'false\'\n    port: 3030, // default -> 8081\n    excludeSourceMaps: true // default \'true\'\n  }),\n],\n```\n\n- `capture` will collect stats on the build where meaningful changes have occurred. We do not capture build data where the build does not differ from most recent build on file.  \n- `target` specify where to save your build data  \n- `launch` will fire up a local server and launch the webpack monitor analysis tool  \n- `port` optionally set the port for local server  \n- `excludeSourceMaps` excludes emitted source maps from the build stats  \n\n## Contributing\nTo contribute to `webpack-monitor`, fork the repository and clone it to your machine then install dependencies with `npm install`.
