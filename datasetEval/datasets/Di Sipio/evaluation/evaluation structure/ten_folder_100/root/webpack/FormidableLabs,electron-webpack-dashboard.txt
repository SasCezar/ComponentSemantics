Unless they were on Windows, or used a weird terminal set up, or if they just wanted more.\n\nMaking things work across a variety of different terminal environments is pretty rough. Also, a web GUI provides some unique UI possibilities that weren\'t there with the term display.\n\nSo here we are.\n\nThe original dashboard felt like working at NASA. 50 years ago. I hope this dashboard feels like working at NASA today. Or at Westworld. Or like the beginning of Westworld at least.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Install\n\nDownload the version for your OS here:\n\n[https://github.com/FormidableLabs/electron-webpack-dashboard/releases/latest](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/electron-webpack-dashboard/releases/latest)\n\nIf you are on macOS you can also install the app via [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/):\n\n```bash\n$ brew update\n$ brew cask install webpack-dashboard\n```\n\n### Webpack 3 compatibility\nTo receive a complete analysis of your bundle, including modules, assets, and problems, you will need to make sure your project is using Webpack Dashboard Plugin 1.0 or higher.\n\n### Configuring Your Project\n\nFirst, in your project, install the `webpack-dashboard` plugin:\n\n`npm install webpack-dashboard --save-dev`\n\nNext, in any Webpack config you want telemetry on, import the plugin:\n\n```js\nconst DashboardPlugin = require(\'webpack-dashboard/plugin\');\n```\n\nThen add the plugin to your config\'s plugins array, like so:\n\n```js\nplugins: [\n  // ... your other plugins\n    new DashboardPlugin()\n  ],\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nSimply hit save on a project running `webpack-dev-server`, or run your build task that builds with `webpack` and providing you have configured your project as shown above, you should see the dashboard start to display data.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe visualizations view was essentially recreated using code from [https://github.com/chrisbateman/webpack-visualizer](https://github.com/chrisbateman/webpack-visualizer), and I am forever grateful that I didn\'t have to figure this stuff out on my own.\n\n## Maintenance Status\n\n**Archived:** This project is no longer maintained by Formidable.
