b"[![Build Status](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/app/rest/builds/buildType:JetBrainsUi_CreateReactKotlinApp/statusIcon.svg)](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=JetBrainsUi_CreateReactKotlinApp&guest=1)\n[![JetBrains team project](http://jb.gg/badges/team.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)\n\n[Japanese](https://github.com/JetBrains/create-react-kotlin-app/blob/master/README-ja.md)\n[Korean](https://github.com/JetBrains/create-react-kotlin-app/blob/master/README-ko.md)\n\n# Create React Kotlin App\n\nCreate [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) apps in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) with no build configuration.\n\nPlease note that this is an **early preview version**.\n\n## Quick Overview\n\n**Make sure you have [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html) installed before proceeding.** Java 9 is not supported yet.\n\nCreate a new project:\n\n```sh\nnpx create-react-kotlin-app my-app\n```\n([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher. See [Installation](#installation) for older npm versions.)\n\nRun the project:\n```sh\ncd my-app/\nnpm start\n```\n\nThen open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>\nWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.\n\nCreate React Kotlin App will configure Kotlin, webpack, and IntelliJ IDEA so that you can focus on the code instead.\n\nJust create a project, and you\xe2\x80\x99re good to go.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall it once globally:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g create-react-kotlin-app\n```\n\nYou can skip this step if you have `create-react-app` already installed or you're using `npx`.\n\n**You\xe2\x80\x99ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine**. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) to easily switch between Node versions for different projects.\n\n**This tool doesn\xe2\x80\x99t assume a Node backend**. The Node installation is only required for Create React Kotlin App itself.\n\n### Using React with Kotlin\n\nTo develop applications in Kotlin that use React you need to use a [Kotlin wrapper for React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jetbrains/kotlin-react).\nYou can find a documentation for it and examples in the [module's repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-react).\n\n### Adding Kotlin/JS packages\n\n**No configuration is required** to add packages written in Kotlin to a project based on Create React Kotlin App, we take care of it for you. \nFor example, you can simply run `npm install @jetbrains/kotlin-react-router-dom` to install the [wrapper for React Router DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jetbrains/kotlin-react-router-dom).\n\n### Creating an App\n\nTo create a new app, run:\n\n```sh\ncreate-react-kotlin-app my-app\ncd my-app\n```\n\nOr if you have `create-react-app` installed, you can run:\n\n```sh\ncreate-react-app my-app --scripts-version react-scripts-kotlin\ncd my-app\n```\n\nIt will create a folder called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>\nThe project will be preconfigured for working with it in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). If you don't want to create the `.idea` folder that is required for IntelliJ IDEA, add `--no-idea` option.<br>\nThe initial project structure will be created and dependencies will be installed:\n\n```\nmy-app/\n  README.md\n  node_modules/\n  package.json\n  .gitignore\n  public/\n    favicon.ico\n    index.html\n    manifest.json\n  src/\n    app/\n      App.css\n      App.kt\n    index/\n      index.css\n      index.kt\n    logo/\n      kotlin.svg\n      Logo.css\n      Logo.kt\n      react.svg\n    ticker/\n      Ticker.kt\n```\n\nIt's a simple app that shows the time that passed since the app was opened.<br>\nOnce the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:\n\n### `npm start` or `yarn start`\n\nRuns the app in development mode.<br>\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\n\nThe page will reload automatically when you make edits.<br>\nYou will see build errors and lint warnings in the console.\n\nIf you are getting a `Kotlin.defineModule is not a function` error, try deleting the npm cache:\n\n\trm -rf node_modules/.cache\n\n### `npm run build` or `yarn build`\n\nBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>\nIt ensures that React is bundled in production mode and the build is optimized for best performance.\n\nThe build is minified and the filenames include hashes for cache management. Your app is ready to be deployed.\n\n### Debugging the App\n\nYou can debug the running app right in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate using its built-in JavaScript debugger. The IDE will run a new instance of Chrome and attach a debugger to it.\n\nStart your app by running `npm start`. Put the breakpoints in your Kotlin code.\nThen select `Debug in Chrome` from the list of run/debug configurations on the top-right and click the green debug icon or press `^D` on macOS or `F9` on Windows and Linux to start debugging.\n\nCurrently, debugging is supported only in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2017.3.\n\nYou can also debug your application using the developer tools in your browser.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n* **One Dependency:** There is just one build dependency. It uses webpack and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.\n\n* **No Configuration Required:** You don't need to configure anything. Reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.\n\n* **No Lock-In:** You can \xe2\x80\x9ceject\xe2\x80\x9d to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.\n\n## What\xe2\x80\x99s Inside?\n\nThe generated project uses the following npm modules:\n* [Kotlin wrappers](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers): [@jetbrains/kotlin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jetbrains/kotlin-react), [@jetbrains/kotlin-react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jetbrains/kotlin-react-dom), [@jetbrains/kotlin-extensions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jetbrains/kotlin-extensions)\n* [Kotlin DSL for HTML](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kotlinx-html)\n* [Kotlin Compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kotlin-compiler)\n* [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) with [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server), [@jetbrains/kotlin-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jetbrains/kotlin-webpack-plugin), [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) and [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader)\n* and others.\n\n## Why Use This?\n\nWith `create-react-kotlin-app` you can quickly bootstrap a new application using Kotlin and React. Your environment will have everything you need to build a new Kotlin app:\n* Kotlin and React syntax support.\n* A dev server that automatically compiles your Kotlin code to JavaScript.\n* A `build` script to bundle JavaScript, CSS, and images for production, with sourcemaps.\n\n## Limitations\n\n* Unit testing is currently not supported in this project. We're now working on the Jest Kotlin wrapper. Stay tuned!\n\n## Converting to a Custom Setup\n\nYou can \xe2\x80\x9ceject\xe2\x80\x9d from the tool and use it as a boilerplate generator.\n\nRunning `npm run eject` copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Kotlin Compiler, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. Commands like `npm start` and `npm run build` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you\xe2\x80\x99re on your own.\n\n**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can\xe2\x80\x99t go back!**\n\n## Contributing and reporting issues\n\nPlease report issues on [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/CRKA), GitHub issues are disabled for this project.\n\nContributions to this project are welcome!
