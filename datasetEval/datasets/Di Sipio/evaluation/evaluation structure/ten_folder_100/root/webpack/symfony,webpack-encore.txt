b"# Webpack Encore: A Simple & Powerful Webpack API\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/symfony/webpack-encore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/symfony/webpack-encore)\n[![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40symfony%2Fwebpack-encore.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40symfony%2Fwebpack-encore)\n![Node](https://img.shields.io/node/v/@symfony/webpack-encore.svg)\n\nWebpack Encore is a simpler way to integrate [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) into your\napplication. It *wraps* Webpack, giving you a clean & powerful API\nfor bundling JavaScript modules, pre-processing CSS & JS and compiling\nand minifying assets. Encore gives you a professional asset system\nthat's a *delight* to use.\n\nEncore is inspired by [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) and\n[Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/mix), but stays in the spirit of\nWebpack: using its features, concepts and naming conventions for a familiar\nfeel. It aims to solve the most common Webpack use cases.\n\n> Encore is made by Symfony and works *beautifully* in Symfony applications.\n> But it can easily be used in any application... in any language!\n\n## Documentation\n\n[Read the Documentation on symfony.com](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html)\nor view a demo application: [symfony/demo](https://github.com/symfony/demo).\n"
