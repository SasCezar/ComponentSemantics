Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-neato`\n3. If you don\'t have a Neato account yet, create one [here](https://www.neatorobotics.com/create-account/).\n4. Update your configuration file. See the sample below.\n\n## Configuration\n\nAdd the following information to your config file. Change the values for email and password.\n\n### Simple\n\n```json\n"platforms": [\n\t{\n\t\t"platform": "NeatoVacuumRobot",\n\t\t"email": "YourEmail",\n\t\t"password": "YourPassword"\n\t}\n]\n```\n\n### Advanced\n\nBelow are explanations for advanced parameters to adjust the plugin to your needs. All parameters are *optional*.\n\n**refresh**  \nTimer for periodic refresh of robot state. The default is `auto`. The options are:  \n`auto` Updates the robot state when a cleaning was started via homekit so that you can activate automations based on a successful cleaning.  \n`120` Or any other time in seconds (minimum `60`) is required if you want to receive robot state updates after starting the cleaning from outside of homekit (e.g. neato app or schedule).  \n`0` Disables background updates completely.\n\n**hidden**  \nList of plugin features that you don\'t want to use in homekit (e.g. `dock`, `dockstate`, `eco`, `nogolines`, `extracare`, `schedule`, `find`, `spot`).\n\n```json\n"platforms": [\n\t{\n\t\t"platform": "NeatoVacuumRobot",\n\t\t"email": "YourEmail",\n\t\t"password": "YourPassword",\n\t\t"refresh": "120",\n\t\t"hidden": ["dock", "dockstate", "eco", "nogolines", "extracare", "schedule", "find", "spot"]\n\t}\n]\n```\n\n## Tested robots\n\nThe plugin is successfully tested with all Neato Connected Robots.\n\n## Contributors\nMany thanks go to\n- [ghulands](https://github.com/ghulands) for finding and fixing a bug when no robot is associated with the neato account\n- [Berkay](https://github.com/btutal) for adding the schema file to use the plugin with homebridge-config-ui-x\n- [Antoine de Maleprade](https://github.com/az0uz) for adding the zone cleaning feature\n- [DJay](https://github.com/DJay-X) for testing out tons of new beta versions'
