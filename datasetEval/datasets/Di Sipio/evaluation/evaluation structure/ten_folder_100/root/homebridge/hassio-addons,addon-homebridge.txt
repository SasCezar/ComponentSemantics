b'# Community Hass.io Add-ons: Homebridge\n\n[![GitHub Release][releases-shield]][releases]\n![Project Stage][project-stage-shield]\n[![License][license-shield]](LICENSE.md)\n\n[![GitLab CI][gitlabci-shield]][gitlabci]\n![Project Maintenance][maintenance-shield]\n[![GitHub Activity][commits-shield]][commits]\n\n[![Bountysource][bountysource-shield]][bountysource]\n[![Discord][discord-shield]][discord]\n[![Community Forum][forum-shield]][forum]\n\n[![Buy me a coffee][buymeacoffee-shield]][buymeacoffee]\n\n[![Support my work on Patreon][patreon-shield]][patreon]\n\nThis add-on provides the installation, configuration, and integration for\n[Homebridge][homebridge].\n\n## Deprecation warning\n\n**This add-on is in a deprecated state!**\n\nAt this point it is unsure how long this add-on keeps available or\nupdated.\n\nThis add-on was originally developed to add HomeKit support to\nHome Assistant. Meanwhile, Home Assistant gained native support\nfor HomeKit.\n\n<https://www.home-assistant.io/components/homekit/>\n\nBecause of this, is very likely that the plugins this add-on rely, on\nwill no longer be developed or maintained.\n\nWe **STRONGLY** suggest to migrate to the Home Assistant HomeKit component.\n\n## About\n\nHomebridge is a server that emulates the iOS HomeKit API, allowing you to\ncontrol your Home Assistant via Apple devices (including Siri).\n\nSince Siri supports devices added through HomeKit, this means that with\nHomebridge you can ask Siri to control devices that don\'t have any support for\nHomeKit at all. For instance, you could say:\n\n- _Siri, unlock the back door._\n- _Siri, open the garage door._\n- _Siri, turn on the coffee maker._\n- _Siri, turn on the living room lights._\n- _Siri, good morning!_\n\n## Installation\n\nThe installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in\ncomparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.\n\n1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.\n1. Install the "Homebridge" add-on.\n1. Start the "Homebridge" add-on.\n1. Check the logs of the "Homebridge" add-on to see if everything went well\n  moreover, to find the pin code needed to add your Home Assistant instance to\n  your iOS device\n\nPlease read the rest of this document further instructions.\n\n**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:\n`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.\n\n## Docker status\n\n[![Docker Architecture][armhf-arch-shield]][armhf-dockerhub]\n[![Docker Version][armhf-version-shield]][armhf-microbadger]\n[![Docker Layers][armhf-layers-shield]][armhf-microbadger]\n[![Docker Pulls][armhf-pulls-shield]][armhf-dockerhub]\n[![Anchore Image Overview][armhf-anchore-shield]][armhf-anchore]\n\n[![Docker Architecture][aarch64-arch-shield]][aarch64-dockerhub]\n[![Docker Version][aarch64-version-shield]][aarch64-microbadger]\n[![Docker Layers][aarch64-layers-shield]][aarch64-microbadger]\n[![Docker Pulls][aarch64-pulls-shield]][aarch64-dockerhub]\n[![Anchore Image Overview][aarch64-anchore-shield]][aarch64-anchore]\n\n[![Docker Architecture][amd64-arch-shield]][amd64-dockerhub]\n[![Docker Version][amd64-version-shield]][amd64-microbadger]\n[![Docker Layers][amd64-layers-shield]][amd64-microbadger]\n[![Docker Pulls][amd64-pulls-shield]][amd64-dockerhub]\n[![Anchore Image Overview][amd64-anchore-shield]][amd64-anchore]\n\n[![Docker Architecture][i386-arch-shield]][i386-dockerhub]\n[![Docker Version][i386-version-shield]][i386-microbadger]\n[![Docker Layers][i386-layers-shield]][i386-microbadger]\n[![Docker Pulls][i386-pulls-shield]][i386-dockerhub]\n[![Anchore Image Overview][i386-anchore-shield]][i386-anchore]\n\n## Configuration\n\nOn the first run, this add-on creates the necessary configuration files\nfor you. Stored in `/config/homebridge/`. You can modify the configuration\nto your liking. For documentation on configuring Homebridge, please refer\nto the [Homebridge GitHub][homebridge] repository. For documentation on\nconfiguring the Home Assistant for Homebridge plugin, please refer to the\n[Home Assistant for Homebridge GitHub][homebridge-homeassistant] repository.\n\nThe add-on has a configuration possibilities as well.\n\n**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._\n\nExample add-on configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  "log_level": "info",\n  "avahi_interfaces": "",\n  "avahi_hostname": "",\n  "avahi_domainname": "local",\n  "enable_ipv6": true,\n  "packages": [],\n  "init_commands": [],\n  "plugins": []\n}\n```\n\n### Option: `log_level`\n\nThe `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can\nbe changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are\ndealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:\n\n- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.\n- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.\n- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.\n- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.\n- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.\n- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.\n\nPlease note that each level automatically includes log messages from a\nmore severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,\nthe `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless\nyou are troubleshooting.\n\nUsing `trace` or `debug` log levels puts the Homebridge server into debug mode.\n\n### Option: `avahi_interfaces`\n\nSet a comma separated list of allowed network interfaces that should be used by\nthe Avahi service. Other interfaces will be ignored. If left empty, the add-on\nwill try to auto-detect the interfaces, which should be fine in most cases.\n\n**Note**: _There is a special internal interface for Hass.io called `hassio`.\nThis interface is always added to the list automatically_\n\n### Option: `avahi_hostname`\n\nSet the hostname to Avahi server. The add-on tries to register on your network\nusing this hostname. If left empty the hostname will be automatically detected\nvia the Hass.io API, which sould be fine in most cases.\n\n### Option: `avahi_domainname`\n\nSet the default domain name for Avahi. The add-on tries to register its hostname\nand services on your network. In most cases, the default, `local`, should be\nfine.\n\n### Option: `enable_ipv6`\n\nIn some situations, IPv6 might cause more problems then it solves.\nSetting this option to `false`, partially disables IPv6 support causing\nAhahi and Homebridge to only listen for connections on IPv4\n\n### Option: `insecure`\n\nAllow unauthenticated requests to Homebridge (for easier hacking). Some\nplugins require this as well. Be aware of the possible security implication\nthis has.\n\n### Option: `packages`\n\nAllows you to specify additional [Alpine packages][alpine-packages] to be\ninstalled to your Homebridge setup (e.g., `python`, `g++`. `make`, `ffmpeg`).\n\n**Note**: _Adding many packages will result in a longer start-up time\nfor the add-on._\n\n### Option: `init_commands`\n\nCustomize your Homebridge setup even more with the `init_commands` option.\nAdd one or more shell commands to the list, and they will be executed every\nsingle time this add-on starts.\n\n### Option: `plugins`\n\nThis Homebridge add-on has support for installing additional Homebridge plugins.\nPlugins are NodeJS modules published through NPM and tagged with the keyword\n`homebridge-plugin`. They must have a name with the prefix `homebridge-`,\nlike `homebridge-mysmartlock`.\n\nThe `homebridge-homeassistant` plugin is already installed for you.\n\nYou can install a plugin by adding it to the add-on configuration. The add-on\nensures the plugin is installed on start.\n\nExample add-on configuration (partial):\n\n```json\n{\n  "plugins": [\n    "homebridge-dummy",\n    "homebridge-mysmartlock"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nYou can explore all available plugins at the NPM website by\n[searching for the keyword homebridge-plugin][homebridge-plugins].\n\n**Note**: _Some plugins require build tools or other packages. You might need to\ninstall these packages using the `packages` option first._\n\n## Adding Homebridge to iOS\n\nUsing the Home app (or most other HomeKit apps), you should be able to add the\nsingle accessory "Home Assistant", assuming that you are still running the\nHomebridge add-on and you are on the same (Wifi) network. Adding this accessory\nautomatically adds all accessories and platforms defined in your\nHome Assistant instance.\n\nWhen you attempt to add the "Home Assistant" accessory, it will ask for a\n"PIN code". This pin code is randomly generated when this add-on is run for\nthe first time. You can find the generated PIN code in the add-on logs and in\nyour `/config/homebridge/config.json` file (where you, of course,\ncan change it as well).\n\n## Known issues and limitations\n\n- Once your device has been added to HomeKit, you should be able to tell Siri to\n  control your devices. However, realize that Siri is a cloud service and iOS\n  may need some time to synchronize your device information with iCloud.\n- Siri will almost always prefer its default phrase handling over HomeKit\n  devices. For instance, if you name your Sonos device "Radio" and try saying\n  "Siri, turn on the Radio" then Siri will probably start playing an iTunes Radio\n  station on your phone. Even if you name it "Sonos" and say\n  "Siri, turn on the Sonos", Siri will probably just launch the Sonos app instead.\n  This is why, for instance, the suggested `name` for the Sonos accessory\n  is "Speakers".\n- One installation of Homebridge can only expose 100 accessories due to a\n  HomeKit limit.\n- Once an accessory has been added to the Home app, changing its name via\n  Homebridge will not be automatically reflected in iOS. You must change it via\n  the Home app as well.\n- If you have set up SSL using a self-signed certificate, you will need to\n  set `verify_ssl` to false in your `/config/homebridge/config.json` file to\n  allow bypassing the NodeJS certificate checks.\n- Errors on startup. The following errors are experienced when starting\n  Homebridge and can be safely ignored.\n\n```txt\n*** WARNING *** The program \'nodejs\' uses the Apple Bonjour compatibility layer\nof Avahi\n*** WARNING *** Please fix your application to use the native API of Avahi!\n*** WARNING *** For more information see\nhttp://0pointerde/avahi-compat?s=libdns_sd&e=nodejs\n*** WARNING *** The program \'nodejs\' called \'DNSServiceRegister()\' which is not\nsupported (or only supported partially) in the Apple Bonjour compatibility layer\nof Avahi\n*** WARNING *** Please fix your application to use the native API of Avahi!\n*** WARNING *** For more information see\nhttp://0pointerde/avahi-compat?s=libdns_sd&e=nodejs&f=DNSServiceRegister\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Homebridge cannot connect or login to Home Assistant\n\nPlease be sure to set the `host` and `password` parameters in the\n`/config/homebridge/config.json` file.\n\nWe recommend using `http://hassio/homeassistant` as the `host` with an\nempty `password`, which allows Homebridge to talk to Home Assistant directly.\n\n### My iOS App Cannot Find Homebridge/Home Assistant\n\nTwo reasons why Homebridge may not be discoverable:\n\n1. Homebridge server thinks it has been paired with, but iOS thinks otherwise.\n  Fix: deleted `persist/` directory which is in your `config/homebridge`\n  directory and restart the add-on.\n\n1. iOS device has gotten your Homebridge `username` (looks like a MAC address)\n  "stuck" somehow, where it is in the database but inactive. Fix: change your\n  `username` in the "bridge" section of `/config/homebridge/config.json` to be\n  some new value and restart the add-on.\n\n## Changelog & Releases\n\nThis repository keeps a change log using [GitHub\'s releases][releases]\nfunctionality.
