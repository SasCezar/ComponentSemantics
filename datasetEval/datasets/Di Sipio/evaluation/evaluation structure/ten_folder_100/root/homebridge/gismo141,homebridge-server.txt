b'[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gismo141/homebridge-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gismo141/homebridge-server)\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/homebridge-server.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/homebridge-server/)\n\n# Homebridge Server - a plugin to configure your Homebridge-devices in your Browser\n\nThe purpose of this plugin is to change your homebridge configuration via the webbrowser.\nThe plugin handles the JSON-part and you - as a user - can add your devices to the bridge.\n\n![Overview](overview.png)\n\nSee my blog post [Configure your Homebridge with Homebridge-Server](https://gismo141.github.io/configure-your-homebridge-2/) on how I implemented this plugin.\n\n## What can you do with this plugin?\n\n1. Change the broadcasted name of your Homebridge\n2. Change the MAC-address used to identify your Homebridge\n3. Change the PIN to verify your Homebridge\n4. Add or Remove platforms\n5. Add or Remove accessories\n6. Change the names of your services\n7. Backup your configuration\n8. Show the Log-file of Homebridge\n9. Reboot your system\n\n## How to setup?\n\nFast way:\n\n```Bash\nnpm install homebridge-server@latest -g\n```\n\nAdd this snippet to your `config.json`:\n\n```JSON\n{\n    "platform": "Server",\n    "port"    : 8765,\n    "name"    : "Homebridge Server",\n    "log"     : "<PATH_TO_YOUR_LOG_FILE>",\n    "restart" : "<COMMAND_TO_EXECUTE>"\n}\n```\n\nThe parameter `"log"` defines where the plugin can find your log.\nIf you\'re using `systemd` to execute `homebridge` then `<PATH_TO_YOUR_LOG_FILE>` should be `"systemd"`.\nIf you\'re executing `homebridge` from a script, then you should pipe its output to a file.\nIn this case `<PATH_TO_YOUR_LOG_FILE>` should be the path to the piped output.\n\nand launch or restart your homebridge, e.g.:\n\n```Bash\nhomebridge\n```\n\nSee the [Wiki](https://github.com/gismo141/homebridge-server/wiki) on how to configure, install and use the plugin for more complex scenarios.\n\n## Backup of your Configuration\n\nIf you want to backup your configuration, hit the Backup-button in the menubar of the webpage.\nThe plugin saves the configuration at the same location of your original configuration but appends an `.bak`-extension.\nWhenever you crash your config you should have a valid backup!\n\n![Backup](backup.png)\n\n## Log-File\n\nYou can directly see what\'s happening on your Homebridge - hit the button in the menubar and the webserver shows you the log in your browser!\n\n![Log File](log_file.png)\n\n## Manage your Homebridge-plugins\n\nFrom this version you are now able to browser, remove, and install all Homebridge-plugins that are available on [https://npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com)!\nThanks to the great API of [https://npms.io](https://npms.io) you can filter the plugins by name and description.\n\n![Plugins](plugins.png)\n\n**At the moment you can receive a 250 results. I\'ll fix it as soon as I can! ;)**\n\n## Rebooting your System\n\nTo make the changes in your configuration permanent, you need to restart the Homebridge-service.\nIf you want, you can restart your Homebridge-running system directly via the webpages `Reboot`-button.\nHit the button in the menubar and wait, until your system has rebooted and your services are back online.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe reboot is immediate!\nIf your Homebridge is not running as a service but as a standalone program you launch manually, the Homebridge won\'t restart automatically.\nYou must setup Homebridge as a service on boot - This is necessary for the plugin to work!\n\nPlease make sure to restart Homebridge manually if you haven\'t set it up as a service.\n\nIf you want to start homebridge as a service, see [Running Homebridge on Bootup](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/wiki/Running-Homebridge-on-a-Raspberry-Pi#running-homebridge-on-bootup).\n\n## How could you contribute?\n\n1.
