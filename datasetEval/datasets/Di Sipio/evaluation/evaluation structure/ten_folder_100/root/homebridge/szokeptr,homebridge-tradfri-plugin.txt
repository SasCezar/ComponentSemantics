b'# homebridge-tradfri-plugin\n\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/homebridge-tradfri-plugin.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/homebridge-tradfri-plugin)\n\nIkea Tradfri Gateway plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).\n\nSupported features:\n- automatically discover your lights and list them\n- turn on and off the lightbulbs\n- adjust brightness\n- adjust color temperature (far from perfect, better solutions than estimating the temperature from hue/saturation are welcome!)\n- NEW: color temperature can be adjusted gradually, not just the 3 predefined values.\n- NEW: support for outlets\n\n![Brightness and Color](http://oo00oo.pw/media/tradfri-screenshots.png)\n\n# Dependencies\n\nThe plugin talks to your gateway through COAP protocol, so you\'ll need to compile [libcoap](https://github.com/obgm/libcoap.git) yourself in order to get going. Instructions for macOS (you need homebrew or some other package manager installed):\n\n```\nbrew install libtool\n\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/obgm/libcoap.git\ncd libcoap\ngit checkout dtls\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n./autogen.sh\n./configure --disable-documentation --disable-shared\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\n# Installation\n\n1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`\n2. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-tradfri-plugin`\n3. Update your configuration file. See the sample below.\n\n# Configuration\n\nYou just need to add the platform to your `config.json` as shown below:\n\n```\n"platforms": [\n...\n{\n  "platform": "IkeaTradfri",\n  "name": "Tradfri",\n  "host": "192.168.x.x",\n  "key": "PSK",\n  "ignoreBulbs": false // set to true to hide bulbs\n}\n],\n```\n\nOf course, you will need to add the IP address of the Ikea gateway and the key, which is printed on the bottom of it.\n\n# Contributing\n\nThe source can be found in the `src/` folder. The project is using rollup to bundle the source files. You just need to run `npm run build` to get it bundled. Don\'t forget to install the devDependencies too!\n\n# Todo\n\n- improve color temperature conversion\n- tests\n\n# Credit\n\nThanks to everyone discussing this in this issue: [https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge/issues/570](https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge/issues/570)\n\nAlso, special thanks to [stenehall](https://github.com/stenehall) for his project, [homebridge-ikea](https://github.com/stenehall/homebridge-ikea) which got me starting.\n'
