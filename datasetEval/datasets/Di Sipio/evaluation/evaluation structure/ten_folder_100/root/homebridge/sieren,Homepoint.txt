the front screen.\n\n- **Trigger individual devices** by diving into scenes (by tapping the indicator or long pressing a button).\n\n+ **See partially switched on scenes** with multiple devices at a glance.\n\n+ Support for **temperature, humidity and air quality sensors**.\n\n+ **HomeKit Switch Support** (Setup Automations in Home App to toggle from Homepoint)*\n\n+ Supports both **Touch Screen or Button based navigation**.\n\n+ **Reactive**: Screen updates whenever devices are triggered from elsewhere.\n\n+ **Easy configuration** through a JSON file, no additional code required.\n\n+ **Screensaver** saves power by switching off screen after 10 minutes.\n\n+ **Statusbar** shows connectivity for WiFi and MQTT as well as time.\n\n*currently on experimental branch.\n<a name="demo">\n  \n# :camera: Demo\n\n[![HomePoint Youtube demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sieren/Homepoint/master/media/youtube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqzpkvtQSvY "HomePoint Youtube demo")\n\n\n<a name="installation"></a>\n\n# :house: Installation\n\nHomepoint was created using the [ESP-IDF SDK](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).\n\nIn order to build HomePoint you need ESP-IDF from the `release/v4.0` branch from the ESP-IDF git repository.  \n\n| Software       | Version                                                                                                                 |\n| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n|  ESP-IDF       | [release/v4.0](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/release/v4.0))                                                           |\n|  Toolchain     | [5.2.0](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started-cmake/index.html#step-1-set-up-the-toolchain) |\n  \n**Clone and build** HomePoint with the following commands:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://www.github.com/sieren/homepoint.git\n$ cd homepoint\n$ git submodule update --init --recursive\n$ mkdir build && cd build\n$ cmake ../\n$ make spiffs_spiffs_bin\n$ make -j 8 flash\n```  \n\nFor use with a **Button-Based** interface:\n```bash\n$ cmake -DBUTTONS=ON ../\n```\n\nFor out-of-the-box use with [**M5STACK**](https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core):\n```bash\n$ cmake -DM5STACK=ON ../\n```\n\nDepending on your hardware, you may have to uncommented the relevant sections in `main/libraries/TFT_ESPI/User_Setup.h`.\n  \nOther Homepoint configuration settings like the Screensaver can be configured in `main/config/Config.h`.\n\n<a name="configuration"></a>\n\n# :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Configuration\n\nThe configuration lives in `data/config.json`.\n\n<a name="devices"></a>\n## Devices & Scenes\n\nHomePoint supports two types of Scenes with a selection of devices each:\n\n| SCENE Types   | DEVICE Types                                                                             |\n| --------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Light, Switch | (none, all devices expected to be switches)                                               |\n| Sensor        | temperature, humidity, voc                                                                |\n\n**Grouped Sensors** support up to two devices (due to screen space).  \n**Lights & Switches** support an infinite number of devices in a group.\n\nSome Sensors use **JSON** as a data-format, in which case a **key** can be defined.\n\n<a name="credentials"></a>\n## WiFi & MQTT Credentials\n\nWiFi and MQTT credentials are to be defined on the top level.\n\n<a name="ntp"></a>\n## NTP Time (optional)\n\nIn order to set the correct timezone, copy & paste your [NTP TZ Setting](https://remotemonitoringsystems.ca/time-zone-abbreviations.php) to the `timezone` key.\n\n\n<a name="examples"></a>\n\n## Example\n\n```json\n{\n  "wifi": "MyWifiSSID",\n  "password": "My Wifi Password",\n  "mqttbroker": "mqtt://192.168.1.2",\n  "mqttusername": "mqttusername",\n  "mqttpasswd": "mymqttpassword",\n  "timezone": "CET-1CEST-2,M3.5.0/02:00:00,M10.5.0/03:00:00",\n  "scenes": [{\n    "name": "Living Room",\n    "type": "Light",\n    "icon": "livingroom",\n    "devices": [{\n      "name": "Side Light",\n      "setTopic": "lights/hue/00:17:88:01:02:3c:2a:6d-0b/set/on",\n      "getTopic": "hue/status/lights/Hue color lamp 1",\n      "onValue": "true",\n      "offValue": "false"\n    }]\n  },\n  {\n    "name": "Bedroom",\n    "type": "Sensor",\n    "icon": "door",\n    "devices": [{\n      "name": "Temperature DHT Sensor",\n      "type": "temperature",\n      "jsondata": true,\n      "temperatureKey": "temperature",\n      "getTopic": "bedroom/esptemp"\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nA more **fully-configured example** is available

[x] Migrate to 4.0 Release Branch\n- [ ] Productionize [HomeKit Support](https://github.com/sieren/Homepoint/pull/10)\n- [ ] Better NTP Time Syncing\n- [ ] Add Unit-Tests\n\n<a name="known-bugs"></a>\n\n# :bug: Known bugs & issues :bug:\n\n- ESP IDF 4.0 has not been released yet and is in influx. Therefore breaking changes might happen.\n\n> If you find any bugs or need assistance, don\'t hesitate and open an issue :)\n\n<a name="contributing"></a>\n\n# :revolving_hearts: Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Just hack away and open a Pull Request.\nBut please follow the style of the code that\'s already there (ie. no tabs, spacing).\n\n<a name="donations"></a>\n\n# :coffee: Buy me a coffee\n\nI have developed HomePoint in my free time because I wanted to learn more about C++ on ESP32\nand to solve a concrete problem in my smarthome.  \nAs development kept on going, I thought about ways to make this project open source and more accessible and user-friendly for the maker-community.  \n\nIf you enjoy using HomePoint or this work, consider a small donation. But don\'t worry, I\'ll continue working on this anyway ;-). \n\n[![paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=WC74EF774344J&lc=US&item_name=homepoint&no_note=0&no_shipping=1&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHostedJ)\n\n### Thanks!!\n\n<a name="license"></a>\n\n# :scroll: License\n\nMIT \xc2\xa9 [Matthias Frick](https://github.com/sieren) \n\n'
