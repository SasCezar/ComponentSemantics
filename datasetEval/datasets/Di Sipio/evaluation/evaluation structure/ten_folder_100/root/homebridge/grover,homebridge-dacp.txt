b'# Homebridge DACP\n\nThis platform plugin enables Homebridge to control devices or programs, which implement [DACP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Control_Protocol). Examples of programs or\ndevices that can be controlled by this plugin are Apple TV and iTunes.\n\nAny system capable of running [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) can be\nused to run `homebridge-dacp`. The only need is network access to the device or program in\nquestion. There is no need to run this on the same machine as iTunes to expose it via HomeKit.\n\nhomebridge-dacp provides volume control and play/pause controls via HomeKit. These can be\nused in conjunction with the [homebridge-callmonitor plugin](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-callmonitor)\nto pause media playback or to reduce the playback volume while on a phone call.\n\nThe Speaker service, which provides volume control and mute, can be disabled if it is not\nrequired - for example if the Apple TV is connected to an A/V receiver that is integrated\nwith HomeKit via a different plugin.\n\n## Status\n\n[![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/grover/homebridge-dacp.svg)](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-dacp)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grover/homebridge-dacp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grover/homebridge-dacp)\n[![Node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/homebridge-dacp.svg?style=flat)](http://nodejs.org/download/)\n[![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/homebridge-dacp.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/homebridge-dacp)\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for changes between versions of this package.\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Supported HomeKit Apps](docs/apps.md)\n* [Supported DACP servers](docs/servers.md)\n* [Installation instruction](docs/install.md)\n  * [Configuring Apple TV](docs/configuration/appletv.md)\n  * [Configuring iTunes](docs/configuration/itunes.md)\n  * [Feature Toggles](docs/configuration/features.md)\n  * [Configuring Playlists](docs/configuration/playlists.md)\n  * [Macros](docs/configuration/macros.md)\n  * [Artwork](docs/configuration/artwork.md)\n* Custom Services and Characteristics\n  * [Media Skipping Service](docs/services/mediaskippingservice.md)\n  * [Now Playing Service](docs/services/nowplayingservice.md)\n  * [Player Controls Service](docs/services/playercontrolsservice.md)\n  * [Playlist Control Service](docs/services/playlistcontrolservice.md)\n  * [Input Control Service](docs/services/inputcontrolservice.md)\n* Examples\n  * [Basic installation](examples/install)\n  * [Apple TV configuration](examples/appletv)\n  * [iTunes configuration](examples/itunes)\n  * [Features](examples/features)\n  * [Playlists](examples/playlists)\n  * [Multiple remotes for multiple apps/devices](examples/multiple-remotes)\n\n## Some asks for friendly gestures\n\nIf you use this and like it - please leave a note by staring this package here or on GitHub.\n\nIf you use it and have a problem, file an issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-dacp/issues) - I\'ll try to help.\n\nIf you tried this, but don\'t like it: tell me about it in an issue too.
