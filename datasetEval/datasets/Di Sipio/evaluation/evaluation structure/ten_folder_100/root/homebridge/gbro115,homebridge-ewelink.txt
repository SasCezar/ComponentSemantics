Please feel free to create a fork and develop extra functionality!\n\nCheck out homebridge-eWeLink-plus\n\n# homebridge-ewelink\nHomebridge plugin to control Sonoff relays with OEM firmware. It uses the same API as the iOS app to communicate with your devices.\n\nThe platform will dynamically add/remove devices based on what is configured in your eWeLink account.\n\nIt has been tested with the [Sonoff basic](http://sonoff.itead.cc/en/products/sonoff/sonoff-basic) relays. I have performed testing with up to two relays associated to my account.\n\nThe plugin will only support one eWeLink account.\n\nIt is possible to continute to use the OEM functionality (eWeLink app, Google Home integration); this plugin requires no modification to the relay\'s firmware.\n\n## Shortcomings\n\nThe plugin uses the same credentials as the eWeLink app. In order to obtain the authenticationToken, you\'ll need to use Charles to inspect the traffic and grab the value from the Authorization header. See below for information on how to obtain this value.\n\nAlso, the code is of suboptimal quality. It was a quick-and-dirty plugin; feel free to contribute & improve.\n\n## Steps to install / configure\n\n*Assuming that you\'ve already downloaded the eWeLink app on your iOS device & have configured it:*\n\n1) Install the plugin\n```\nsudo npm -g install homebridge-ewelink\n```\n\n2) Add to the platforms[] section of config.json. Steps for obtaining the values for authenticationToken, apiHost, and webSocketApi can be found below.\n\n3) Restart Homebridge\n\n### Sample config.json\n\n```\n{\n    "bridge": {\n        "name": "Homebridge",\n        "username": "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX",\n        "port": 51826,\n        "pin": "123-45-678"\n    },\n    \n    "description": "Your description here",\n\n    "accessories": [\n    ],\n\n    "platforms": [\n        {\n        "platform" : "eWeLink",\n        "name" : "eWeLink",\n        "authenticationToken" : "obtain-with-Charles",\n        "apiHost" : "us-api.coolkit.cc:8080",\n        "webSocketApi" : "us-long.coolkit.cc"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Obtaining the Authentication Token and API URL using Charles\n\n[Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) allows us to watch the data being exchanged between the eWeLink iOS app (Android is untested) and the server endpoint.\n\n1) Download and install the eWeLink app to your device\n2) Ensure your Sonoff devices are registered and working with the native app\n3) Ensure the app is logged in to your account\n4) Return back to your device\'s home screen\n\nWith Charles configured and listening for connections from your iOS device, open up the eWeLink app from the home screen. As part of the loading of the app, you\'ll see requests to the following URLs (or similar, depening on your region):\n\n```\nhttps://us-api.coolkit.cc:8080/api/user/device?apiKey=XXXX&appVersion=X.X.X&getTags=1&imei=XXXX&lang=en&model=XXXX&os=ios&romVersion=X.X.X&version=X\n\nhttps://us-ota.coolkit.cc:8080/otaother/app\n```\n\nIn both of these requests, look at the request header\n\n![Viewing HTTPS Authorization Header in Charles](https://i.imgur.com/88PlK6Eh.png)\n\n```\nBearer abcdefghijklnmopqrstuvwxyz\n```\n\nThe abcdefghijklnmopqrstuvwxyz is what you\'d put as the configuration file\'s authenticationToken value.\n\nAPI URLs are also shown in this request. You need to use the URL in webSocketApi and apiHost\n\n### A note on the authenticationToken\n\nThe authentication token is generated every time your device\'s app logs in to the eWeLink service. Based on my limited testing, the session seems to persist for quite some time.\n\nYou can only have one authentication token per user account. \n\nIf you logout and login to the app again, you\'ll need to perform the above steps to get things working again.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nI\'ve attempted to make the logging as useful as possible. If you have any suggestions, please open an issue on GitHub.\n\n## Sample logging\n\n```\n[12/13/2017, 9:39:05 PM] [eWeLink] A total of [1] accessories were loaded from the local cache\n[12/13/2017, 9:39:05 PM] [eWeLink] Requesting a list of devices from eWeLink HTTPS API at [https://us-api.coolkit.cc:8080]\n[12/13/2017, 9:39:06 PM] [eWeLink] eWeLink HTTPS API reports that there are a total of [1] devices registered\n[12/13/2017, 9:39:06 PM] [eWeLink] Evaluating if devices need to be removed...\n[12/13/2017, 9:39:06 PM] [eWeLink] Verifying that all cached devices are still registered with the API.
