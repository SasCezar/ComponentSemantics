The first time you install may take some time as the latest [oznu/homebridge](https://hub.docker.com/r/oznu/homebridge/) image is downloaded from Docker Hub.\n\n**Step 6:** Use the Homebridge app icon in the main menu to access the Homebridge UI where you can manage your setup.\n\n![oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x/master/screenshots/homebridge-config-ui-x-status.png)\n\nThe Homebridge Config UI app starts on port `8581`. The default username is **admin** with password **admin**.\n\n## Updating Homebridge\n\nHomebridge can be updated from inside the Config UI. From time to time you may need to upgrade the [oznu/homebridge](https://hub.docker.com/r/oznu/homebridge/) image which can be done by stopping and starting the package in the Synology DSM Package Center.\n\n## Adding Additional Packages\n\nSome plugins may require additional packages to be installed which can be done by editing the `startup.sh` script.\n\nThe `startup.sh` file will be created in the volume you choose during the setup wizard. You can edit this file from the UI by going to the Docker menu -> Startup Script.\n\nExample `startup.sh` file to install `ffmpeg`:\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/sh\n\napk add --no-cache ffmpeg ffmpeg-libs\n```\n\nExample `startup.sh` file to install `libpcap-dev`:\n\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/sh\n\napk add --no-cache libpcap-dev\n```\n\n**To apply the changes made to the `startup.sh` file you need to restart the entire container using the Docker app in DSM.**\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have an issue with the installation of Homebridge using this package please raise an issue on this project's GitHub page. For everything else:\n\n* Docker/Platform Issues: [oznu/docker-homebridge](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge)\n* Homebridge Conifg UI Issues: [oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x)\n* General Homebridge Issues: [nfarina/homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)\n* For problems with individual plugins please raise issues on the relevant GitHub project page.\n\nSome users have reported not being able to get Homebridge to work at all on their Synology NAS while Bonjour is activated, see [this issue](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/issues/35) for more details.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcome.\n\n## Setting up for development\n\nSee the [Synology DSM 6.0 Developer Guide](https://developer.synology.com/developer-guide/index.html).\n"
