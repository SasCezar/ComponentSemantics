Just use the plattform-code "eveatmo" and remove "ttl" and/or the other "refresh_" properties for the beginning.\n\n```\n"platforms": [\n        {\n            "platform": "eveatmo",\n            "name": "eveatmo platform",\n            "extra_co2_sensor": false,\n            "co2_alert_threshold": 1000,\n            "ttl": 540,\n            "auth": {\n    \t        "client_id": "XXXXX Create at https://dev.netatmo.com/",\n                "client_secret": "XXXXX Create at https://dev.netatmo.com/",\n                "username": "your netatmo username",\n                "password": "your netatmo password"\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n\n```\n\n- **extra_co2_sensor: (optional)** Adds an extra CO2 sensor which is available via Apple\'s stock Home.app, too. Default value is *false*\n- **co2_alert_threshold (optional):** Sets the co2-level [ppm] at which the sensors switch to alert-state\n- **ttl: (optional)** Seconds between two Netatmo API polls. Lower is not neccessarily better! The weatherstation itself collects one value per 5minutes, so going below 300s makes no sense. Default value is *540* (=9min)\n- **auth:** Credentials for the Netatmo API\n- **module_suffix: (optional)** If this is set, the Netatmo\'s devicename will not be prepended to the modulename. Instead this config-value will be appended - with a space - to the module name \n\n### Retrieve client id and secret\n\n1. Register at http://dev.netatmo.com as a developer\n2. After successful registration create your own app by using the menu entry "CREATE AN APP"\n3. On the following page, enter a name for your app. Any name can be chosen. All other fields of the form (like callback url, etc.) can be left blank.\n4. After successfully submitting the form the overview page of your app should show client id and secret.\n\n## Siri Voice Commands\n\nHere are sample English voice commands:\n- How cool is it in the ROOM NAME?\n- How warm is it in the ROOM NAME?\n- How humid is it in the ROOM NAME?\n- What\'s the temperature in my ROOM NAME?\n- What\'s the humidity in my ROOM NAME?\n- What\'s the air quality in my ROOM NAME?\n- What\'s the CO2 level in my ROOM NAME?\n- What\'s the carbon dioxide level in my ROOM NAME?\n\nSiri understands variations of each command:\n- What\'s the temperature ROOM NAME?\n- What\'s the temperature in ROOM NAME?\n- What\'s the temperature in my ROOM NAME?\n- What\'s the temperature in the ROOM NAME?\n- What\'s the temperature down in my ROOM NAME?\n- What\'s the temperature down in the ROOM NAME?\n\nSiri voice commands may vary by language. Since this plugin tries to mimic the Elgato Eve devices, you can search the Eve blog for articles listing voice commands in your language.\n\nBlog posts with English commands:\n- https://blog.evehome.com/fun-with-siri/\n- https://blog.evehome.com/tip-siri-names/\n\nBlog posts with German commands:\n- https://blog.evehome.com/de/spass-mit-siri/\n- https://blog.evehome.com/de/tipp-siri-namen/\n\n## History\n\nsee [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/skrollme/homebridge-eveatmo/blob/master/HISTORY.md)\n\n## ToDos\n- <del>maybe refactoring to split characterstics into separate services (better functionality in Apple\'s default home.app)</del>\n- reintegrate <del>rain-sensor, wind-sensor and</del> thermostat\n- <del>adding CO2 [ppm] or maybe just "CO2 detected" to indoor devices</del>\n- <del>researching/testing/implementing Eve\'s history-functionality (see: [https://gist.github.com/0ff/668f4b7753c80ad7b60b](https://gist.github.com/0ff/668f4b7753c80ad7b60b))</del>\n- <del>Make CO2 trigger threshold configurable (see: https://github.com/skrollme/homebridge-eveatmo/issues/24)</del>\n\n\n## Thanks\n\nThis plugin\'s basic structure and most of its basic code is a fork (ok, lets say "copy") of [homebridge-netatmo](https://github.com/planetk/homebridge-netatmo). So big thanks to @planetk and all the other contributors of this project. \n\nAlso big thanks to @gomfunkel and @simont77 for [this gist](https://gist.github.com/gomfunkel/b1a046d729757120907c) and its [fork](https://gist.github.com/simont77/3f4d4330fa55b83f8ca96388d9004e7d), @KhaosT for [this gist](https://gist.github.com/KhaosT/e365acfd589ce840a403), @mplewis for [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mplewis/def678dc4b6e63a86905) and @0ff for [this (almost) working Eve Weather imitating homebridge-plugin](https://gist.github.com/0ff/668f4b7753c80ad7b60b) and once again special thanks to @simont77 for his endurance in digging deeper in Eve\'s custom characteristics and its protocols.\n\n## What else\n\nLike this and want to express your feelings?
