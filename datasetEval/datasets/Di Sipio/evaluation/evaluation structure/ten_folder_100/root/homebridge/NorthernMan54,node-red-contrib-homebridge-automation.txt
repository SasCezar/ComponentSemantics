( To create accessories in HomeKit, please use node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged. )\n\n![Homebridge Nodes](docs/Homebridge%20Nodes.png)\n\nFour different node types are available, the first node `hb event` listens for changes to an accessory (ie on/off) and sends a message into Node-Red containing the updated accessory status.  The second node `hb resume` holds the state of an accessory and supports creating a state resume function. The third node `hb status` allows you to poll an accessory for status. The forth node `hb control` allows you to control a homebridge accessory.  Each node is tied to an individual Home App Tile/Service of an accessory (ie on/off and brightness).\n\nPayload from a dimmable lightbulb.\n\n```\n{ "On":true, "Brightness":100 }\n```\n\n![Homebridge Nodes](docs/HAP%20Event%20Nodes.png)\n\n## Caveats\n\n* Please keep in mind that this integration only works with devices supported/exposed with HomeBridge Plugins.  This does not have visibility to Native HomeKit devices.  ( Similar to my homebridge-alexa plugin. )\n\n* For the `hb event` node, the ability of a Accessory to generate events in Real Time is dependent on how the plugin was architected and the actual device.  Some are very good at generating events in real time, and others only generate events when the Home App is opened to the accessory. YMMV.\n\nWith a plugin, you can see if it supports Real Time events, by opening the Home App, and looking at an accessory.  Then trigger a local event outside of homebridge/homekit.  If the accessory updates in real time, then it support Real Events.  ( An example of a local event can be turning on a Smart Light Switch, by the local switch.  Another example would be using the vendor app to control an accessory.)\n\n## Changes\n\n### Mar 18, 2019 - Version 0.0.39\n\n- Changed `hb state` to `hb resume` to make the use case for the node more self-explanatory. If you had used the `hb state` node in your existing flow, nodeRed will not start unless you manually change the node type in the flow file.  To fix the issue, manually edit the flow file in your .node-red directory, and change the type reference `hb-state` to `hb resume`\n- Changed individual nodes from being characteristic based to device/service based.  When updating from previous versions, you will need to select your devices again.\n- With the change in nodes to be device/service based, the payload message structure changed from being individual characteristic based to a JSON object containing all the characteristics you want to update on the device.  ie in the previous version a device control message payload of `true` going to the On characteristic would turn on a light, with this version it would be be represented with a message payload of `{ "On":true, "Brightness":100 }`.  This particular payload would turn on a light and set the brightness to 100.  I made this change to enable easier intergradation with node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged.\n- If you send an incorrect message payload to the `hb resume` or `hb control` nodes it would output a debug message containing the valid/supported characteristics for use in the payload object.\n- Updated the Homebridge accessory parser, so more diverse devices will now be exposed.\n\n### Mar 19, 2019 - Version 0.0.42\n\n- Fix for events being missed after homebridge restarts\n\n### Mar 31, 2019 - Version 0.0.\n\n- Fix for a crash when events are received by an accessory with multiple services.\n\n### May 9, 2019 - Version 0.0.43\n\n- Added retries for registering of events during startup.  ( 1000 retries, retry delay of 30 seconds )\n\n### May 15, 2019 - Version 0.0.44\n\n- Added reqTimeout and set default timeout on homebridge requests to 14 seconds\n\n### May 29, 2019 - Version 0.0.45\n\n- Name Change to Homebridge-Automation\n\n### July 27, 2019 - Version 0.0.50\n\n- Publish as a NPM package to resolve #17\n\n# Backlog / Roadmap\n\n* [x] - Update Node Information with Homebridge Accessory Details ( hapEndpoint, deviceType, description )\n* [x] - Sort device drop down listing\n* [x] - Trim Node name to just accessory Name\n* [x] - Documentation - Fix README with latest options\n* [x] - Documentation/Naming - Normalize on Accessory, Service, Event and Characteristic\n* [x] - Hap-Node-Client is not reentrant, and multiple requests get lost.

This is same as my [Homebridge Alexa](https://github.com/NorthernMan54/homebridge-alexa) plugin, and you just need to follow the [Prepare homebridge for plugin](https://github.com/NorthernMan54/homebridge-alexa#prepare-homebridge-for-plugin-installation) instructions there.\n\n## 3 - Install Homebridge-Automation into Node-Red\n\n    cd ~/.node-red\n    npm install node-red-contrib-homebridge-automation\n\n## 4 - Start Node-Red\n\n## 5 - Initial setup and configuration inside Node-Red\n\n* 5.1 Select \'hb event\' node and place onto flow.\n* 5.2 Double click on hb event node ( now called \'Choose accessory/event\')\n\n![Choose](docs/Choose.png)\n\n* 5.3 Please select the **pencil** to the right of the PIN Field.\n\n![Pencil](docs/Pencil.png)\n\n* 5.4 Please enter your PIN, and select **Add**.\n\n![Pin Entered](docs/Pin%20Entered.png)\n\n* 5.5 Now select **Done**.\n\n![Done](docs/HAP%20Event%20Done.png)\n\n* 5.6 Now select **Deploy**\n* 5.7 Please wait about 30 seconds.  ( Node-RED is busy discovering all your accessories.)\n* 5.8 Initial setup and config is complete.\n\n## 6 - Configure \'hb event\' to receive updates from your Accessories\n\n* 6.1 Double click on hb event node ( now called \'Choose accessory/service\')\n\n![Populated](docs/HAP%20Event%20Populated.png)\n\n* 6.2 The device drop down should now be populated with all your Homebridge accessories.\n\n![Populated](docs/HAP%20Event%20Drop%20Down.png)\n\nThe accessory naming convention is:\n\nAccessory Name and Accessory Service Type\n\n# Node-RED Homebridge-Automation Message Structure\n\n## hb event\n\nThis node generates a message every time an Accessory changes status, and generates a message containing the updated status of all the characteristics.\n\n### Output\n\nMessage is structured like this\n\n```\nmsg = {\n  name: Accessory Name,\n  payload: { "On":true, "Brightness":100 }\n  Homebridge: Homebridge instance name,\n  Manufacturer: Plugin Manufacturer,\n  Type: Homebridge device type,\n  _device: Unique device identifier,\n  _confId: node.confId,\n  _rawEvent: Raw event message\n};\n```\n\nMessage payload will vary depending on characteristics support by the device, this example is from a dimmable light.\n\nPlease note that multiple event messages may be received from a single device event, this is due to how homebridge controls devices and emits events.\n\n## hb resume\n\nThis node can be used to create a resume previous state flow.  Where you change the state of an accessory, and have it resume the previous state afterwards.  I\'m using this, in conjunction with Alexa to give the ability to turn on and off the lights in a room, but not turn any lights that were already on.  I\'m also using it with the HomeKit "I\'m home" automation, to turn a group of lights for a few minutes then turn off.  But at the same time have any lights you already had on, stay on.\n\n### input\n\nBased on the message input payload and state of the accessory the output changes.\n\nFor  `{"On":true}`, the node just passes the message to output.  For the first `{"On":false}`, the output is the state of the accessory from prior to the last turn on.  For the second `{"On":false}`, the out is `{"On":false}`.\n\n```\nmsg = {\n  payload: { "On":true, "Brightness":100 }\n};\n```\n\n### output\n\n```\nmsg = {\n  payload: { "On":true, "Brightness":100 }\n};\n```\nMessage payload will vary depending on characteristics support by the device, this sample is from a dimmable light.\n\nTo find supported characteristics for a device, please send an invalid message payload to the node, and it will output the supported characteristics in the debug log.\n\n## hb status\n\nThis node allows you to poll a Homebridge accessory and collect the current status of all the characteristics.\n\n### input\n\nAnything\n\n### output\n\nMessage is structured like this\n\n```\nmsg = {\n  name: Accessory Name,\n  payload: { "On":true, "Brightness":100 }\n  Homebridge: Homebridge instance name,\n  Manufacturer: Plugin Manufacturer,\n  Type: Homebridge device type,\n  _device: Unique device identifier,\n  _confId: node.confId,\n  _rawEvent: Raw event message\n};\n```\nMessage payload will vary depending on characteristics support by the device, this sample is from a dimmable light.\n\n## hb control\n\nThis node allows you to control all the characteristics of a Homebridge accessory.  The message payload needs to be a JSON object containing the values of all the characteristics you want to change.  If you send the node an invalid payload, it will output all the available characteristics of the accessory in the debug tab.\n\n### Input\n\nThe hb control node only looks at msg.payload value, and ignore\'s all others.\n\n```\nmsg = {\n        payload: { "On":true, "Brightness":100 }\n      }\n```\nMessage payload will vary depending on characteristics support by the device, this sample is from a dimmable light.\n\nTo find supported characteristics for a device, please send an invalid message payload to the node, and it will output the supported characteristics in the debug log.\n\n# Flows Shared from Community\n\nI have started collecting flows for useful functions on the wiki.\n\nhttps://github.com/NorthernMan54/node-red-contrib-homebridge-automation/wiki\n\n# Troubleshooting / DEBUG MODE\n\n## To start Node-RED in DEBUG mode, and output Homebridge-Automation debug logs start Node-RED like this.\n\n```\nDEBUG=-express*,-send*,-body-parser*,* node-red\n```\n'
