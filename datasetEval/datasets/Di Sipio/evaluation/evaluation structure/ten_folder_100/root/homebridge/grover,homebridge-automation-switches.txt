b'\n# Automation Switches Platform\n\nA platform that provides configurable switches for automation purposes. This platform can be created to provide time delayed responses in HomeKit rules or to simulate security systems.\n\n## Status\n\n[![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/grover/homebridge-automation-switches.svg)](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-automation-switches)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grover/homebridge-automation-switches.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grover/homebridge-automation-switches)\n[![Node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/homebridge-automation-switches.svg?style=flat)](http://nodejs.org/download/)\n[![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/homebridge-automation-switches.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/homebridge-automation-switches)\n\n## Why do we need this plugin?\n\nThis platform provides software based, optionally persistent, switches to create DIY HomeKit solutions.\nEach switch has specific purposes that are illustrated in their respective documents linked below.\n\nThe plugin provides four different types of switches: A basic on/off switch, a lock mechanism, an automation switch with advanced properties and a security system. All of them are configured ahead\nof their use through the configuration file and each one of them potentially saves their state to storage\nto keep their state even across crashes, reboots and such.\n\n## Installation instructions\n\nAfter [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) has been installed:\n\n ```sudo npm install -g homebridge-automation-switches```\n\n## Example config.json:\n\n```json\n{\n  "bridge": {\n      ...\n  },\n  "platforms": [\n    {\n      "platform": "AutomationSwitches",\n      "switches": [\n        {\n          "type": "automation",\n          "name": "Automation Switch #1",\n          "period": 1800,\n          "autoOff": false\n        },\n        {\n          "type": "security",\n          "name": "Home alarm"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe platform can provide any number of switches that have to be predefined in the homebridge config.json.\n\n### Switch types\n\nPlease see the documentation for each type of switch this plugin is able to create:\n\n- [Automation switch](docs/AutomationSwitch.md)\n- [Lock mechanism](docs/LockMechanism.md)\n- [Security system](docs/SecuritySystem.md)\n- [Switch](docs/Switch.md)\n- [Slider](docs/Slider.md)\n- [Alarm Clock](docs/AlarmClock.md)\n- [Solar Clock](docs/SolarClock.md)\n- [Random value](docs/Random.md)\n\nAn advanced configuration example containing all four switch types can be found [here](docs/Configuration.md).\n\n### Storage\n\nEvery type of switch is able to store every state change to disk. This is useful if homebridge is restarted for whatever reason: The switches created by this plugin will retain the state they had before the restart.\n\nFor that the switches create individual files in the persist subfolder of your homebridge configuration folder.\n\n## Developer Information\n\nThere\'s [documentation](docs/CustomCharacteristics.md) of the custom services and characteristics exposed by the switches.\n\n## Supported clients\n\nThis platform and the switches it creates have been verified to work with the following apps on iOS 11:\n\n* Home\n* Elgato Eve\n\n## Credits\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS.md) for acknowledgements to the individuals that contributed to this plugin.\n\n## Some asks for friendly gestures\n\nIf you use this and like it - please leave a note by staring this package here or on GitHub.\n\nIf you use it and have a problem, file an issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-automation-switches/issues) - I\'ll try to help.\n\nIf you tried this, but don\'t like it: tell me about it in an issue too. I\'ll try my best\nto address these in my spare time.\n\nIf you fork this, go ahead - I\'ll accept pull requests for enhancements.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Michael Fr\xc3\xb6hlich\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
