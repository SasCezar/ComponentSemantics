b'# Homebridge UniFi Occupancy Sensor\n\nThis Homebridge plugin will provide an occupancy sensor accessory to HomeKit based on the devices connected to WiFi access points managed by a [UniFi Controller](https://www.ubnt.com/download/unifi).\n\nThe plugin connects to the UniFi Controller event web socket to get instant notifications of connecting devices - which can then be used to trigger HomeKit actions like turning on the lights.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Node.js v4 or later\n* [UniFi Controller](https://www.ubnt.com/download/unifi) v5\n\n## Homebridge Config\n\n```javascript\n"accessories": [\n  {\n    "accessory": "UniFi Occupancy Sensor",\n    "name": "Occupancy Sensor",\n    "unifi": {\n      "controller": "https://demo.ubnt.com:8443",  // Required.

The internal site name might not match the name you have allocated to the site exactly, you can get the required site name by navigating to the site in the unifi controller then looking at the url bar:\n\n```\nhttps://unifi.com:8443/manage/site/mofkpypu/dashboard\n```\n\nIn this case the site name is `mofkpypu` and this is the value that should be entered in your Homebridge config.'
