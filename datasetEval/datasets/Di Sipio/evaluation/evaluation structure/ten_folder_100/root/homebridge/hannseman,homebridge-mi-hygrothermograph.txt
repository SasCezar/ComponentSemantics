The new E-Ink [sensor](https://cleargrass.com/cg_temp_rh_monitor/overview) and [clock](https://item.mi.com/product/9542.html) are also supported but currently not capable of reporting battery levels.\n\n![alt text](images/hygrothermograph.png "Xiaomi Mi Bluetooth Temperature and Humidity Sensor")\n\n## Installation\nMake sure your system matches the prerequisites. You need to have a C compiler and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) newer or equal to version 8.6.0 installed. \n\n[Noble](https://github.com/noble/noble) is BLE central module library for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) used to discover and read values from the sensor. \n\n These libraries and their dependencies are required by the [Noble](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noble) library and provide access to the kernel Bluetooth subsystem:\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev\n```\n\nFor more detailed information and descriptions for other platforms please see the [Noble documentation](https://github.com/noble/noble#readme).\n\n### Install homebridge and this plugin \n```\n[sudo] npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge\n[sudo] npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge-mi-hygrothermograph\n```\n\n**Note:** depending on your platform you might need to run `npm install -g`  with root privileges.\n\nSee the [Homebridge documentation](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#readme) for more information.\n\nIf you are running Homebridge as another user than `root`  (you should) then some additional configuration needs to be made to allow [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) access to the kernel Bluetooth subsystem without root privileges. \nPlease see the [Noble documentation](https://github.com/noble/noble#running-without-rootsudo) for instructions.\n\n\n## Homebridge configuration\nUpdate your Homebridge `config.json` file. See [config-sample.json](config-sample.json) for a complete example.\n\n```json\n"accessories": [\n    {\n      "accessory": "Hygrotermograph",\n      "name": "Temperature & Humidity"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n| Key                     | Default         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `accessory`             |                 | Mandatory.

Configuration for publishing values to an MQTT-broker. See the [MQTT](#mqtt) section for details.                                                                                                 |\n| `forceDiscovering`      | `true`          | Retry start scanning for devices when stopped. For some users scanning will be stopped when connecting to other BLE devices. Setting `forceDiscovering` to `true` will start scanning again in these cases. |\n| `forceDiscoveringDelay` | `2500`          | The delay for when to start scanning again when stopped. Only applicable if `forceDiscovering` is `true`.                                                                                                   |\n| `updateInterval`        |                 | By default values will be updated as they come in.

Look for `MJ_HT_V1` and copy the address.\nThe address is in the format of `4c:64:a8:d0:ae:65`.\n\nUpdate your Homebridge `config.json` and specify the `address` key:\n\n```json\n"accessories": [\n    {\n      "accessory": "Hygrotermograph",\n      "name": "Room 1",\n      "address": "4c:64:a8:d0:ae:65"\n    },\n    {\n      "accessory": "Hygrotermograph",\n      "name": "Room 2",\n      "address": "2c:34:b3:d4:a1:61"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nNote that this step is also required when running [Mi Flora](https://xiaomi-mi.com/sockets-and-sensors/xiaomi-huahuacaocao-flower-care-smart-monitor/) devices in the same location as they use the same protocol and their data will be intercepted by this plugin.\n\n#### MacOS\n\nOn MacOS `hcitool` can\'t be used since MacOS does not provide a way to read the MAC-address of a BLE device. \nInstead MacOS assigns a device unique identifier for each BLE device in the format of `5C61F8CE-9F0B-4371-B996-5C9AE0E0D14B`. \nThis identifier can be found using MacOS tools like [Bluetooth Explorer](https://developer.apple.com/bluetooth/). \nOne can also run Homebridge with debug-mode enabled by using `homebridge -D` and then watch the logs for the string "Discovered peripheral" and fetch the value under `Id`. Use this identifier as `address` in the configuration file.\n\n\n### Timeout\nIf the accessory has not received an updated value from the sensor within the specified timeout it will inform Homekit\nthat the accessory is not responsive by returning an error until it receives an updated value.\n\nThe default timeout is 15 minutes but can be changed by specifying the number of minutes under the `timeout` parameter in `config.json`:\n\n```json\n"accessories": [\n    {\n      "accessory": "Hygrotermograph",\n      "name": "Temperature & Humidity",\n      "timeout": 30\n    }\n]\n```\n\nIf the `timeout` parameter is set to `0` timeouts are disabled and and devices will not be reported as unresponsive to Homekit.\n\n### Naming\nBy default the Humidity and Temperature accessories visible in the Home-app will have the names "Humidity" and "Temperature". They can be changed in the Home-app if wanted.\n\nIt is also possible to set custom initial values by specifying the `humidityName` and `temperatureName` parameters in `config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  "humidityName": "Luftfuktighet",\n  "temperatureName": "Temperatur"\n}\n```\n\n### Elgato Eve\n\nThis plugin has support for adding historical data to the [Elgato Eve App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elgato-eve/id917695792) by using the excellent module [fakegato-history](https://github.com/simont77/fakegato-history).\n\nWhen using this feature it\'s required to specify the address of the device as described in [Multiple sensors](#multiple-sensors).\nThis is required because [fakegato-history](https://github.com/simont77/fakegato-history) requires a unique serial number for each device.\n\nWhen restarting Homebridge the Eve app will show the Accessories as having 0% battery until the sensor actually reports its battery status. This can sometimes take a couple of minutes. Just be patient and the actual battery status will show up.\n\nThe E-Ink sensors do not report the current battery level. This will cause Elgato Eve to incorrectly warn about low battery. Set `disableBatteryLevel` to `true` to disable these warnings.\n\nTo enable the Elgato Eve feature set `fakeGatoEnabled` to `true` in `config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  "fakeGatoEnabled": true\n}\n```\n\n[fakegato-history](https://github.com/simont77/fakegato-history) caches historical values into a json-file.\nUsually located in `/var/lib/homebridge` or `~/.homebridge`. To customise this one can set `fakeGatoStoragePath` to the desired path:\n\n```json\n{\n  "fakeGatoStoragePath": "/tmp/"\n}\n```\n\n### MQTT\n\nThe plugin can be configured to publish temperature/humidity/battery values to an MQTT-broker. \n\nBasic configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  "mqtt": {\n    "url": "mqtt://test.mosquitto.org",\n    "temperatureTopic": "sensors/temperature",\n    "humidityTopic": "sensors/humidity",\n    "batteryTopic": "sensors/battery"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf one is interested in only publishing a specific value just skip configuring the topics wished to ignore:\n\n```json\n{\n  "mqtt": {\n    "url": "mqtt://test.mosquitto.org",\n    "temperatureTopic": "sensors/temperature"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo enable authentication specify the `username` and `password` parameters:\n\n```json\n{\n  "mqtt": {\n    "url": "mqtt://test.mosquitto.org",\n    "username": "admin",\n    "password": "hunter2",\n    "temperatureTopic": "sensors/temperature"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor more options see the [MQTT.js documentation](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md#client).\nEverything set in `mqtt` will be passed to the `options` argument on `Client`.\nThe `Client#publish` options `qos` and `retain` can also be configured the same way.\n\n## Technical details\nThe plugin scans for [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) peripherals and check the broadcast advertisement packets.\nBy only reading the advertisement packet there is no need to establish a connection to the peripheral.\nInside each packet discovered we look for Service Data with a UUID of `0xfe95`. If found we start trying to parse the actual Service Data to find the temperature and humidity.\n\nBy using a [Bluetooth LE Sniffer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2269) it is possible to see that the peripheral advertises 3 different sized Service Data: \n1. `50:20:aa:01:be:64:ae:d0:a8:65:4c:0d:10:04:cc:00:8a:01`\n2. `50:20:aa:01:ba:64:ae:d0:a8:65:4c:06:10:02:84:01`\n3. `50:20:aa:01:c0:64:ae:d0:a8:65:4c:0a:10:01:5d`\n\nSome bytes stay the same and some bytes change over time. By placing the peripheral in different temperated places it could be established that the last bytes contain the sensor data.\n\nThese were the observations:\n\n* In the first example the last two bytes `8a:01` contains the humidity data. `8a:01` as an little endian 16-bit integer is equal to `394` as in 39.4 % relative humidity. If we check the next two bytes `cc:00` they equal to `204` as in 20.4 celsius. \n* In the second example `84:01` equals to `388` as in 38.8 % relative humidity. No temperature could be found in this data, more on that later. \n* In the shortest and third example `5d` equals to `93` and this very much looks like the charge level on the battery in percent.\n* If we start looking at the other bytes in order the next one looks like a length indicator for the following bytes with `04`, `02` and `01` as values. \n* The following two bytes almost always stays the same for each sized packet except for the 16 bytes sized data here they alterate between `06:10` and `04:10`. \nAfter some investigation it is established that these bytes indicate what type of sensor data that will follow. `06:10` will have humidity data and `04:10` will have temperature data.\n`0d:10` indicate that both humidity and temperature data will follow and `0a:10` that battery data is to be expected. \n\nSo we actually have 4 different packets that contains the sensor data:\n\n1. `50:20:aa:01:be:64:ae:d0:a8:65:4c:0d:10:04:cc:00:8a:01`\n2. `50:20:aa:01:ba:64:ae:d0:a8:65:4c:06:10:02:84:01`\n3. `50:20:aa:01:bf:65:ae:d0:a8:65:4c:04:10:02:cc:00`\n4. `50:20:aa:01:c0:64:ae:d0:a8:65:4c:0a:10:01:5d`\n\nAfter some investigation and thanks to [node-xiaomi-gap-parser](https://github.com/LynxyssCZ/node-xiaomi-gap-parser) it is probable that the data of `50:20:aa:01:be:64:ae:d0:a8:65:4c:0d:10:04:cc:00:8a:01` represents the following: \n\n| byte  | function      | type      |\n|:-----:|---------------|-----------|\n| 1-2   | Frame control | bit field |\n| 3-4   | ID            | uint16LE  |\n| 5     | Index         | uint8LE   |\n| 6-11  | MAC-address   | string    |\n| 12-13 | Type of data  | uint16LE  |\n| 14    | Length        | uint8LE   |\n| 15-16 | Temperature   | int16LE   |\n| 17-18 | Humidity      | uint16LE  |\n\nBytes 1-14 have the same function for all 4 variations but the following bytes contain different sensor data.\n\n## Automation (iOS 13+)\nThere is a new very handy automation option in iOS 13 allowing us to convert home automation rule to "Advanced shortcut". \n\nUsing that you can make rules like "If temperature drops below 21C and someone is at home and it is not during night then turn on heater". Unfortunately you can\'t normally bind this rule to any timer trigger. However you can use other homebridge plugin which fakes sensor events e.g. every 5 seconds and you can bind that rule to it! Check https://github.com/nitaybz/homebridge-delay-switch\n\n## Known problems\nSome hardware combinations are problematic and may cause weird troubles like sensor timeout after some time etc. \n* Asus BT-400 bluetooth dongle (at least in combination with older RPi 2B)\n\n## Legal\n\n*Xiaomi* and *Mi* are registered trademarks of BEIJING XIAOMI TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.\n\nThis project is in no way affiliated with, authorized, maintained, sponsored or endorsed by *Xiaomi* or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries.\n'
