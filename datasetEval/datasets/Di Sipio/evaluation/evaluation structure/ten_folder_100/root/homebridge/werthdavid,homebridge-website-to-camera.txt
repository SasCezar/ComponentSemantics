Download the latest Chromium `sudo apt-get install chromium-browser`\n2. Verify the Chromium installation by running `chromium-browser`, output should be similar to `(chromium-browser:30533): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display`\n3. Install this plugin using: `sudo npm install -g homebridge-website-to-camera`\n4. Update your Homebridge `config.json` using the sample below (append in the block \'platforms\' not \'accessories\')\n\n\n# Configuration\n\nUpdate your config similar to this:\n```json\n "platforms": [\n      {\n         "platform": "website-camera",\n         "cameras": [\n            {\n               "name": "Website 1",\n               "url": "http://github.com",\n               "chromiumPath": "/usr/bin/chromium-browser"\n            }\n         ]\n      }\n   ]\n```\n\n**You can add multiple cameras!**\n\n## Config file\n\n\nTake a look at the <a href="config.example.json">example config.json</a>\n\n\nFields:\n\n* `name` name of the camera (required)\n* `url` the URL of the website that is to be captured (required)\n* `scale` HomeApp requests an (probably device dependent) size for the preview-image. \nWith e.g. `scale` set to `2` (default) the virtual browser window is set to this size. Best is to skip this field.\n* OR `width` / `height` the width/height of the virtual browser window. This is optional and overrides `scale`.\n* `chromiumPath` path to chromium-executable (defaults to "/usr/bin/chromium-browser")\n* `timeout` timeout in ms for waiting until the page has no more pending requests. resembles to puppeteer.goto() (defaults to 10000 --> 10s)\n* `renderTimeout` timeout in ms for waiting AFTER the page has loaded before taking the screenshot. userful for PWAs. (defaults to 1ms)\n\n\n# Usage\n\nIn some cases, the camera is not visible in Home-App:\n* Press + on top right corner in Home-App\n* Press `Add device`\n* Press `Code missing`\n* Select Camera\n\n# Background\n\nThe plugin uses Puppeteer/Chrome headless to capture the screenshots. The Browser instance stays open all the time for better performance and less CPU/Mem consumption.\n\n# TODO\n\n* Live-Video not working. As far as I understood HomeKit requires an RTSP-stream where it can connect to. So this feature might not come at all.'
