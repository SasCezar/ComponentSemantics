b"# JavaScript miner for the cryptocurrency Monero Blockchain (XMR) using Coin-Hive \xf0\x9f\x92\xb0\n\n# Use Client's CPU Power\nMonero is different. To mine Monero, you have to calculate hashes with an algorithm called Cryptonight. This algorithm is very compute heavy and \xe2\x80\x93 while overall pretty slow \xe2\x80\x93 was designed to run well on consumer CPUs.\n\nThere are solutions to run the Cryptonight algorithm on a GPU instead, but the benefit is about 2x, not 10000x like for other algorithms used by Bitcoin or Ethereum. This makes Cryptonight a nice target for JavaScript and the Browser.\n\nOf course, when running through JavaScript performance still takes a bit of a toll, but it's not that bad. Our miner uses WebAssembly and runs with about 65% of the performance of a native Miner. For an Intel i7 CPU (one of the fastest desktop CPUs) you should see a hashrate of about 90h/s. A native miner would get to 140h/s.\n\n## How to use\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s very simple, download and open the page coinhive-monero.html\n\nYou must sign-in on coinhive.com, copy the site-key, and paste in my page coinhive-monero.html\nmodify SITE_KEY: Coin-Hive's Site Key\n\nAutomaticaly the Javascript into start mining with your CPU.\n\nOn coinhive you could see the progress of you Monero mining\n\nAlso, if you are a programmer, you could copy my js to paste in some your page, in this way your visitors will do mining for you. ;)\n\n## Disclaimer\nThis project has nothing to do with `coin-hive.com`\n"
