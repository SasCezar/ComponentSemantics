Welcome to Issues section!\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Download source (or use [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)) into your project\n2. Add MoneroKit.xcodeproj as a sub-project or into your workspace\n3. Add MoneroKit.framework into "Link Binary With Libraries" section of project "Build Phases"\n4. In your project/view initialization, add miner initialization code and implement "MoneroMinerDelegate" protocol (look in MoneroKitSample directory for examples)\n\n## Mining pools\n\nSome pools introduced limits for botnet/webmining workers. To avoid limits, you can (and should) use [xmr-node-proxy](https://github.com/Snipa22/xmr-node-proxy).\n\n## Developer support\n\nYou may define multiple workers in your project, and define "weight" for each worker. If you want to support further development of MoneroKit, you may use following worker configuration:\n\n```\nlet developerWorker = MoneroWorker(\n  identifier: "donation",\n  poolHost: "moneropool.phoenix.dj",\n  port: 7777,\n  secure: false,\n  walletAddress: "",\n  password: "x",\n  weight: 0.1 // 10% donation\n)\n```\n\nFeel free to pick any weight for donation worker, and thank you for support!\n\nIf you prefer one-time donation, you can use following Monero Wallet Address:\n\n`48xSeFyBQRmRv7BFbQU16wVEVsWrEEGEuMDHjP66roWXHCLvKesdsTxWS6ef9SdHzeQZW1Lxds9rYGwiqHhpoW393S7ZAPM`\n\n## License\n\n\xc2\xa9 2018 Yury Popov _a.k.a.
