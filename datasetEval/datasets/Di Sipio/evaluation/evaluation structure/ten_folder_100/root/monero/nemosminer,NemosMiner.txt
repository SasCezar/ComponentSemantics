Config tab\n      2. Set your Wallet address and Username\n      3. Select your pool \n      4. Save Config\n      5. Start\n      \n      note: 2. you only need to change Username if you are using Miningpoolhub\n      \n     Algo selection / removal\n  \n      +algo for algo selection\n      -algo for algo removal\n\n      If "+" Used, all selected algo have to be listed\n      If "Minus" Used, all algo selected but exluded ones.\n\n      Do not combine + and - for the same algo\n\n     Examples:\n     Algo list = -x16r\n     Will mine anything but x16r\n\n     Algo list = -x16r,-bcd\n     Will mine anything but x16r and bcd\n\n     Algo list = +x16r\n     Will mine only x16r\n\n     Algo list = +x16r,+bcd\n     Will mine only x16r and BCD\n\n     Algo list blank\n     Will mine anything\n  \n  Pools variants\n\n      24hr - uses last 24hour Actual API too request profit\n         -Low switching rate\n      plus - uses advanced calculations to reduce switching\n         -Medium switching rate\n      normal - uses current estimate API too request profit\n         -High switching rate\n  \n  Developer/Contributors Donation: \n  list and wallets is publicly available at: https://nemosminer.com/data/devlist.json\n     \n      There is a 5 minute per day donation (0.3%), that can be changed in the config (Minimum is 3)0.2%\n      We want to stay completely transparent on the way donations are managed in the product. Donations occurs once every 24 hours for the selected amount of time (default 5 minutes). The first donation sequence occurs 1 hour after miners are started. If Interval is set higher than the donation time, the interval will prime. Example for default parameters. Miners started at 10, First donation cycle runs at 10:55 untill 11, Next donation cycle occurs 24 hours after.All donation time and addresses are recording in the logs folder.\n\nNemosMiner Monitoring Server : https://nemosminer.com\n\n     Keep tabs on all your mining rigs from one place\n     You can now optionally monitor all your workers remotely, both in the GUI and via https://nemosminer.com  \n     Monitoring setup instructions https://nemosminer.com/setup.php \n\n   \n   GUI\n   \n      Since version 3.0 NemosMiner has a GUI making it easy to configure and run.\n\t  Relies on config files. No need to edit bat files. Simply run NemosMiner \n\t  Set the config on the config tab, save, close, run\n\n   Pause mining\n   \n      Ability to pause miners while keeping other jobs running (pause button)\n      This will stop mining activity\n      BrainPlus will still run in the background avoiding the learning phase on resume\n      EarningTracker will still run in the background avoiding the learning phase on resume\n\n   prerun\n   \n      Ability to run a batch prior switching to a specific algo.\n      For example, can be used to set per algo OC via nvidiaInspector\n      Simply create a file named <AlgoName>.bat in prerun folder\n      If <AlgoName>.bat does not exist, will try to launch prerun/default.bat\n      Use overclock with caution\n\n   Per pools config (Advanced)\n   \n        - **This is for advanced users. Do not use if you do not know what you are doing.**\n        - You can now set specific options per pool. For example, you can mine NiceHash on the internal wallet and other pools on a valid wallet. This configuration is provided as an example in Config\\PoolsConfig-NHInternal.json\n          - Available options\n            - Wallet = your wallet address\n            - UserName = your MPH user name\n            - WorkerName = your worker name\n            - PricePenaltyFactor = See explanation below\n\t    - Algorithm = List of included or excluded Aglo on pool (see example files)\n          - Usage\n            - The file Config\\PoolsConfig.json contains per pool configuration details. If a pool is listed in this file,\n\t    the specific settings will be taken into account. If not, the setting for the entry name default will be used.\n\t    **Do not delete the default entry.**\n            - Edit Config\\PoolsConfig.json\n            - Add an entry for the pool you want to customize\n              - The name must be the NemosMiner name for the pool. ie. for ahashpool, if you use Plus. The name is ahashpoolplus.\n              - (**careful with json formating ;)**)\n              - Best way is to duplicate the default entry\n        - Note that the GUI only updates the default entry. Any other changes need to be done manualy\n\n   PricePenaltyFactor\n\n        - When using advanced per pool configuration, it is possible to add a penalty factor for a specific pool. This simply adds as a multiplicator on estimations presented by the pool.\n        - Example scenario\n          - NiceHash has a 4% fee - Set PricePenaltyFactor to 0.96 (1-0.04)\n          - You feel like a pool is exaggerating his estimations by 10% - Set PricePenaltyFactor to 0.9\n\n  zergpoolplus/nlpoolplus/ahashpoolplus/zpoolplus/blazepoolplus/phiphipoolplus/blockmastersplus/hashrefineryplus\n   \n      Uses calculations based on 24hractual and currentestimate ahashpool prices to get more realistic estimate.\n      Includes some trust index based on past 1hr currentestimate variation from 24hr.\n      AND is NOT sensible to spikes.\n      This shows less switching than following Current Estimate and more switching that following the 24hr Actual.\n      Better profitability.\n\n   Earnings Tracking\n   \n      Displays BTC/H and BTC/D as well a estimation of when the pool payment threshold will be reached.\n      Supported pools:\n            ahashpool\n            zpool\n            nicehash\n            miningpoolhub (partial)\n      If mining more that one pools, shows stats for any supported pool\n      Press key e in the console window to show/hide earnings\n\n   Support running multiple instances\n   \n      **Experimental**\n      More than one instance of NemosMiner can run on the same rig\n      Each instance must be placed in it\'s own directory\n      Miner has to be started prior the launch of the next instance\n\n   Optional miners (Advanced)\n   \n      Some miners are not enabled by default in NemosMiner for a variety of reasons:\n       \n              These are closed source and therefore not enabled in NemosMiner by default.\n              Use at your own risk.\n \n      For advanced users, check the Optional Miners checkbox on the Config tab to enable these miners.\n      \n   CustomMiners (Advanced)\n      \n      Users can place any miner.ps1 from miners/optionalminers or custom user created miner.ps1 files, in CustomMiners folder \n      leaving miners and optionalminers disabled in config will enable CustomMiners folder \n\n   Algo switching log\n   \n      Simple algo switching log in csv switching.log file found in Logs folder.\n      You can easily track switching rate.\n\n   Console Display Options\n   \n      Use -UIStyle Light or -UIStyle Full in config.json\n            Full = Usual display (Default)\n            Light = Show only currently mining info\n      UIStyle automaticaly swtiches to Full during benchmarking.\n\n   In session console display toggle\n   \n      Press key s in the window to switch between light and full display\n      Press key e in the window to show/hide earnings \n      Will toggle display at next refresh\n\n   New version notification\n   \n      NemosMiner will notify new version availability\n*****\n \nIf you have Windows 7, 8, or 8.1, please update PowerShell:\n[update PowerShell](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616)\n\nsome miners may need \'Visual C++ 2015\' if you don\'t already have it: (install both x86 & x64) \n[Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015/2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48145)\n\nsome miners may need \'Visual C++ 2013\' if you don\'t already have it: (install both x86 & x64) \n[Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2013/2012](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=40784)\n\nrunning multiple cards its recommended to increase Virtual Memory 64gb is optimal\n\nrecommended/optimal Windows Nvidia driver 430.39 \n\n[Windows10](http://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/430.39/430.39-desktop-win10-64bit-international-whql.exe)\n\n[Windows7, 8, 8.1](http://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/430.39/430.39-desktop-win8-win7-64bit-international-whql.exe)\n\nrecommended/optimal Linux Nvidia driver 430.09\n\n[Linux/Hiveos](http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/430.09/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-430.09.run)\n\nMade for & Tested with 6x1070 6x1070ti 6x1080 6x1080ti 6x1660ti 6x2060 6x2070 6x2080 6x2080ti(users have reported up to 12cards working have not tested myself)\nSome miners do not support more that 9 cards\n\n*****\n\nLicensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0\nPermissions of this strong copyleft license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license.
