The miner can take advantage of some instructions specific to ARMv5E and later processors, but the decision whether to use them is made at compile time, based on compiler-defined macros.\n   * To use NEON instructions, add "-mfpu=neon" to CFLAGS.\n * x86:\n   * The miner checks for SSE2 instructions support at runtime, and uses them if they are available.\n * x86-64:\t\n   * The miner can take advantage of AVX, AVX2 and XOP instructions, but only if both the CPU and the operating system support them.\n     * Linux supports AVX starting from kernel version 2.6.30.\n     * FreeBSD supports AVX starting with 9.1-RELEASE.\n     * Mac OS X added AVX support in the 10.6.8 update.\n     * Windows supports AVX starting from Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.\n   * The configure script outputs a warning if the assembler doesn\'t support some instruction sets. In that case, the miner can still be built, but unavailable optimizations are left off.\n\nUsage instructions\n==================\nRun "minerd --help" to see options.\n\n### Connecting through a proxy\n\nUse the --proxy option.\n\nTo use a SOCKS proxy, add a socks4:// or socks5:// prefix to the proxy host  \nProtocols socks4a and socks5h, allowing remote name resolving, are also available since libcurl 7.18.0.\n\nIf no protocol is specified, the proxy is assumed to be a HTTP proxy.  \nWhen the --proxy option is not used, the program honors the http_proxy and all_proxy environment variables.\n\nDonations\n=========\nDonations for the work done in this fork are accepted at\n* MRO: `472haywQKoxFzf7asaQ4XKBc2foAY4ezk8HiN63ifW4iAbJiLnfmJfhHSR9XmVKw2WYPnszJV9MEHj9Z5WMK9VCNHaGLDmJ`\n* BTC: `139QWoktddChHsZMWZFxmBva4FM96X2dhE`\n\nCredits\n=======\nCPUMiner-multi was forked from pooler\'s CPUMiner, and has been developed by Lucas Jones.\n* [tpruvot](https://github.com/tpruvot) added some features and recent SHA3 based algorythmns\n* [Wolf9466](https://github.com/wolf9466) helped with Intel AES-NI support for CryptoNight\n\nLicense\n=======\nGPLv2.
