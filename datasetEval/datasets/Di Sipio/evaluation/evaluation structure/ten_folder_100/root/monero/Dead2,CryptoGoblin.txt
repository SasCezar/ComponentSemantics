b'# CryptoGoblin - CryptoNight CPU/GPU mining tool\n**For coins based on the cryptonight algorithm family.**<br>\n**Support for Monero, Electroneum, Aeon, Sumokoin, Edollar and many more.**\n\nCryptoGoblin is a greedy mining goblin that will push the cpu to get as many hashes as possible,\nif you believe in cpu-rights, then this might not be the mining tool for you.\n\n## Overview\n* [Download](https://github.com/Dead2/CryptoGoblin/releases)\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/Dead2/CryptoGoblin/tree/master/doc)\n\nCryptoGoblin was forked from xmr-stak in early 2017, it utilizes several GCC compiler-specific tweaks and\nmany other (medium, small, minor and micro) optimizations to get the most speed out of your cpu.<br>\nCryptoGoblin can also be compiled using MSVC, but several of the optimizations will not be activated.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\nIf you are using Windows, download the pre-compiled windows binaries, or compile them yourself.<br>\nIf you are using Linux, MacOS, BSD or similar, you need to compile them yourself.\n\nAfter you have compiled or downloaded the executables, just run the miner without any configuration files,\nand it will help you generate the config files. After that, you can optionally tune your configuration.\n* [CPU Tuning](doc/tuning-cpu.md)\n* [GPU Tuning](doc/tuning-gpu.md)\n\n## Windows\nDownload the pre-compiled binaries [here](https://github.com/Dead2/CryptoGoblin/releases)\n\n## Compilation\nCryptoGoblin includes a script `build.sh` that can be edited to easily change important settings\nand then run to start the compilation.\n\nTo compile, run:\n`./build.sh`\n\nFor more information about compiling and dependencies, please have a look at the documentation\ntargeting your OS/distro [here](https://github.com/Dead2/CryptoGoblin/tree/master/doc).\n\n## Donation\nDev fee mining is set to 1.4%, and part of it goes to xmr-stak authors.\n\nIf you want to make a little donation directly to me (Dead2), transfers or donation mining (at pool.supportxmr.com:3333), my XMR address is:\n```\n45obtQLBPgyZL8Xb4qFFdZQLZugJzkHUo7oHeKd2zZSmfjxRg6WKhAjD4o1eb6LjK1RY2V4sp1nmDAity9Ks9NvZHw8z1EL\n```\nAny donation is much appreciated.\n\n'
