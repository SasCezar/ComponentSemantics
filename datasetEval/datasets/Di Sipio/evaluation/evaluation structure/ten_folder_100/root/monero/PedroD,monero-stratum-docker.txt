b"# What is it?\n\nThis project will allow you to solo mine using any monero miner you like, be it CPU or GPU (literally any miner that works with a stratum pool)!\n\nBy running `start.sh` (if you have docker installed) you are automatically creating a [Monero Stratum pool](https://github.com/sammy007/monero-stratum.git) in your local machine.\n\nYou can then connect any miner you like to this pool by connecting to localhost:3333 (or remote_ip:3333 if your miner is on another computer).\n\nJust remember to edit the `configs.json` with your wallet's address and upstream address.\n\nThe upstream address is where the pool gets the blockchain and its real-time updates (to read and submit new blocks).\n\nIn practice this means you need to have `monerod` (monero daemon) running somewhere (in the local machine where the pool is running for eg.).\n\nOther alternative is to download monero-wallet-gui and start the daemon there.\n\nIf it is your first time you'll have to download the entire blockchain (it will take hours), or you can just download it from [here](https://downloads.getmonero.org/blockchain.raw) and then import it to your wallet app using `monero-blockchain-import --verify 0 --input-file ./blockchain.raw`.\n\n`monero-blockchain-import` should be within the folder of monero-wallet-gui or your [monero](https://github.com/monero-project/monero.git) installation (check the Dockerfile of this project to see how monero is installed).\n\n## The noob way\n\nSo, in sum if you are a beginner:\n\n1. Install monero-wallet-gui.\n2. Download the blockchain and use the `monero-blockchain-import` command as I stated above, or just leave the wallet synchronizing for about half a day.\n3. Change the address in the `config.json` file to your wallet receive address (or leave mine there if you are feeling generous :) ).\n4. Run `sh start.sh` and wait some minutes until you start seeing logs like `2017/08/29 23:56:51 Loading config: /monero-stratum/config.json`.\n5. Configure any miner of your choice (eg. xmr-stak-nvidia, ccminer, etc) and configure it to use this stratum, for eg. my miner was configured this way: `ccminer -o stratum+tcp://192.168.0.108:3333 -u <your wallet address here>`, where `192.168.0.108` is the IP of the machine running this docker container, which could be `localhost`.\n6. You can also activate the solo mining option in the Advanced tab on your monero-wallet-gui to add some more horse power.\n7. Take a look at http://localhost:8082/ in the machine where you're running the container.\n8. Enjoy your solo mining!\n\n**Note:** You can add more miners, if you are able to host this online you can create your own online private pool!\n\n# Reserve a place in Heaven\n\n### Donation Monero address:\n45Dizd9V5VvanN7YmJcNo6ddp8pcyuxFgFkL9zipWRnTfZJeQ5F4PFN7Dn9b5GkJnMiVQ1PVG8DyTfmjouLFBWtp5HYjs9w\n\n### Donation Bitcoin address:\n1K76eEG1gC7S2aehVbrqpdcNysrNhuC9V7\n"
