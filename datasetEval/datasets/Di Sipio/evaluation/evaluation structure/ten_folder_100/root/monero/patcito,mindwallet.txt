b"## MindWallet\n\nMindWallet is a deterministic cryptocurrency address generator heavily based on [MemWallet](https://github.com/dvdbng/memwallet) but using argon2 instead scrypt as hashing function,\nit's like [WarpWallet](https://keybase.io/warp/), but it works for Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero and Bitcoin. You never have to save or store your private key anywhere. Just pick a really good password - many random words, for example - and never use it for anything else.\n\nGiven the same Passphrase and Salt, MemWallet will always generate the same address and private key, so if you only need to remember your password to access your funds.\n\nFor more information on why this is safer than a regular brainwallet, see [WarpWallet](https://keybase.io/warp/)'s help, MindWallet is a re-implementation of WarpWallet, but it works for other currencies thanks to MemWallet who makes up for most of the  most of the code. WarpWallet and MemWallet use the same algorithm, so WarpWallet and MemWallet will generate the same Bitcoin address for a given Passphrase and salt.\n\nAnother difference between MindWallet and MemWallet is that MindWallet makes use of a web worker to make it faster, this forces you to make use of a web server.\n\nThis repo containst an implementation of MindWallet in JavaScript and Go.\n\n### Instructions to run the html:\n\n$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\nThen open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000\n\n### Instructions to run the go executable:\n\nFirst [install golang](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\nSecond install go dep:\n\nOn Mac:\n\n$ brew install dep\n\nAnywhere else:\n\n$ go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep\n\nThen run:\n\n$ dep ensure\n\nNow build the binary:\n\n$ go build mindwallet.go\n\nRun it like that:\n\n$ ./mindwallet bitcoin my_password my_salt\n\nYou can add more memory cost at the end by adding one the following options: strong, very_strong or ridiculously_strong. These can take minutes\nto execute but as this is something you won't be re-uinsg a lot, it may not be a big deal.\n\nHave fun!\n"
