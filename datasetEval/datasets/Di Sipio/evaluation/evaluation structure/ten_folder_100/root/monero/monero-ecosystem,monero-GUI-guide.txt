b"## Guide for the Monero GUI wallet\n\nThis repository contains the guide for the [Monero GUI Wallet](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/releases).\nThis document is meant to be updated continuously and **a new major release will be available whenever Monero publishes a new version of the GUI**.\n&nbsp;\n\nThe guide is composed by several different markdown files (see the chapter 'structure'). For simplicity, we have an easy-to-consult version:\n&nbsp;\n\n**[monero-GUI-guide.md](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/monero-GUI-guide.md)**\n\n### Versions and branches\nThe links above are for the **upstream version of the guide**. In other words, they are synced with the *master* branch of the Monero GUI wallet.\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you are looking for the guide for a specific GUI release, change the branch of this repository.  \nBranches available:\n\n+ **[1.5](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/tree/1.5)**: Monero GUI 0.13.0.3 and 0.13.0.4 'Beryllium Bullet'\n+ **[1.6](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/tree/1.6)**: Monero GUI wallet version 0.14.1\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor **PDF** and **EPUB** versions, check out the [latest Release](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/releases).\n\n## Structure and guidelines for contributors\nThe original guide can be found in the [en](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en) folder. It's divided in 9 main chapters:\n\n**Chapter**|**Content**\n---|--- \n00 | [Preface](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en/ch00.md)\n01 | [Welcome](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en/ch01.md)\n02 | [Create a Wallet](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en/ch02.md)\n03 | [Monero Account](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en/ch03.md)\n04 | [Send Monero](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en/ch04.md)\n05 | [Receive Monero](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en/ch05.md)\n06 | [Transaction History](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en/ch06.md)\n07 | [Advanced Features](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en/ch07.md)\n08 | [Settings](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en/ch08.md)\n09 | [Binaries Verification](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en/ch09.md)\n10 | [About Remote Nodes](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en/ch10.md)\n11 | [Common Issues and Solutions](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide/blob/master/en/ch11.md)\n\nThese single chapters can be built in a single file in 3 different formats: **HTML**, **PDF** and **EPUB**.  \nTo do so we use pandoc. If you wish to **build the guide by yourself**, you can do it following these steps (on Linux):\n\n1. Download Pandoc and all necessary dependencies:\n```\nsudo apt install pandoc\nsudo apt install texlive texlive-xetex texlive-latex-extra\n```\n\n2. From the source of the repository run:\n```\nmake [format][-language]\n```\nFor example, if you wish to build only the Spanish version in PDF format, you should run `make pdf-es`.  \nIf you want all languages in a single format: `make epub`- This will give you the epub version in all languages.  \nIf you want to build all formats for all available languages: `make all` - This will build the guide in PDF, HTML and EPUB in all available languages.\n\n### Contribute!\nImprovements are always welcome. Feel free to propose a change using the issue tracker or opening a pull request.  \nIf you wish to contribute, please **do not** edit the file *monero-GUI-guide.md*. That's just temporary and it gets built manually. Work ONLY on the *.md* files inside the 'en' folder. Every pull request with changes to *monero-GUI-guide.md* will be rejected.\n\n## Translations\nBefore adding a translation, please keep in mind the general guidelines for Monero translators, which are:\n\n- **Avoid** the use of **gender specific** terminology.\n- If available, use the **glossary** for your language. This will help to keep translations consistent across different works. You can find all glossaries [here](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/tree/master/terminology-guides).\n- Read the guide '[Translation tips for Monero translators](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/blob/master/translation-tips.md)'. **It contains all the information you need** to submit a perfect translation.\n- If a string contains numbers, just keep them as they are.\n\n### Steps\nAdding a translation is very easy:\n\n1. Copy the *en* folder with all its content (including the 'makefile') and rename the new folder with the codename of your language (for example */it* for Italian).\n2. Translate all the text you find, except for code and html.\n3. Edit the string `LANGUAGES =` in the main makefile, after 'en' (or the previous added language) add the name of the folder which contains your translations.\n4. Push the changes to your local branch and open a pull request.\n\n**Do not edit** the files contained in the /translations folder. They are manually built. All changes MUST be done on the appropriate source folder (/en for English, /es for Spanish, etc..).\n\n### Support\nIf you need **help/support**, open an issue on this repository or contact ErCiccione. You can do so:\n  \n+ On the **live support chat of the localization workgroup**: `#monero-translations` (on IRC/Freenode, MatterMost, riot/matrix)\n+ By **email**: translate[at]getmonero[dot]org\n+ On **reddit**: just PM /u/erciccione\n\n## Donations\nThe creation and maintainance of this guide require a lot of hours of work. I think it's a very useful document and I'm happy to work on it voluntarily. The only problem is that the creation/maintainance of the guide **requires** a high consumption of beer. If you would like to help me refill my fridge and show the middle finger to my liver, consider donating to this Monero address:\n&nbsp;\n\n84fCZdZik8KauctPhh6ZQ1KgMb99zpKKQWvR6kSCedtr4L596YjLiaaFYqhUU9pV6qXWjTLoNWUVCiKinC9uFKuq8azHTit\n"
