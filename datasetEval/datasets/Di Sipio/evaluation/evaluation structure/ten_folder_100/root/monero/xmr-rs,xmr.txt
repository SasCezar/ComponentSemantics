It aims to be a full\nMonero node with wallet functionality.\n\n*This is a work in progress that is not yet functional*\n\n## Building Xmr\n\nXmr is built with the [Cargo][1] package manager. First, ensure you have the\nlatest stable Rust version (it hasn\'t been tested with older Rust versions).\nThen run this in the `xmr` repository folder:\n\n[1]: https://crates.io/\n\n```bash\ncargo build\n```\n\nThis will create the `dxmr` binary in the *target/debug* directory.\n\nTo build the binary optimized for release:\n\n```bash\ncargo build --release\n```\n\n## License\nSome parts of the code are GPLv3 due to them being base on the `parity-bitcoin` code.\nHowever the code that isn\'t related to the `parity-bitcoin` code is licensed under\nthe MIT or Apache 2.0 at your option.\n'
