Download the latest release of the app ([Latest release](https://github.com/cryptoprofitswitcher/CryptonightProfitSwitcher/releases/latest))\n2. Extract it\n3. Optimize the Xmr-Stak config\n    1. Go to the folder *Xmr-Stak*\n    2. Edit the *cpu_v7.txt*, *cpu_heavy.txt*, *cpu_lite.txt* according to your CPU.\n    3. Edit the *amd_v7.txt*, *amd_v8.txt*, *amd_heavy.txt*, *amd_lite.txt* according to your GPU.\n4. Set your pool mined coins\n    1. Go to the folder *Coins*\n    2. Delete the existing coins you don\'t want to mine\n    3. Edit the coins you want to mine\n    4. Add the additional coins you want to mine\n4. Set your NiceHash algorithms\n    1. Go to the folder *NicehashAlgorithms*\n    2. Delete the existing NiceHash algorithms you don\'t want to mine\n    3. Edit the NiceHash algorithms you want to mine\n    4. Add the additional NiceHash algorithms you want to mine\n5. Open the file *Settings.json* and edit the settings, most importantly edit the expected hashrates\n6. Start *CryptonightProfitSwitcher.exe* (Optional: As administrator)\n7. PROFIT!!!\n\nYou can also use it with Cast XMR, SRBMiner or JCE Miner. The steps are similar like above.\nJust look at the comments in the JSON files and you will understand how to use other miners.\n\n### Default configuration\n\nIf you download the latest release, there will be a default configuration:\n\n- CPU: AMD Ryzen 1600X\n- GPU: AMD Vega 64 + AMD Vega 56\n- Coins: Bittube, Graft, Haven Protocol, Loki, Masari, Stellite, AEON, MoneroOcean, Monero, BLOC.money, Conceal, Lethean\n- NiceHash: CryptonightV8, CryptonightV7, CryptonightHeavy\n- Miner: XmrStak\n\nYou have to change the default configuration for your setup, see **How to use?**.\n\n## How to add a pool mined coin?\n\n1. Open the *Coins* folder\n2. Copy an existing coin to the same location.\n3. Rename it and edit the JSON-File.\n\n## How to add a NiceHash algorithm?\n\n1. Open the *NicehashAlgorithms* folder\n2. Copy an existing algorithm to the same location.\n3. Rename it and edit the JSON-File.\n\n# How does what work?\n\n### Profit switching\n\n1. App will load pool mined coins from the *Coins* folder.\n2. App will load NiceHash algorithms from the *NicehashAlgorithms* folder.\n3. App will load settings from Settings.json.\n4. App will periodically check the profitability.\n5. App will start the most profitable mining method based on the defined strategy.\n\n#### Strategy 1: MaximizeFiat (default)\nWill select the coin / NiceHash algorithm that has the most profit in USD per day.\n#### Strategy 2: MaximizeCoins\nWill select the coin that has the least difficulty to mine compared to the 24h average difficulty.\nThis strategy will ignore the price of the coin and does only work with coins that have profit data for 24h average.\n#### Strategy 3: WeightedCoinsPrice\nThis strategy is a combination of the above two strategies.\nIt will multiplicate the profit in USD per day with the relative coin difficulty and maximize this new value.\nThis strategy will work with all coins / NiceHash algorithms because it will use *1* for the relative coin difficulty if it can\'t get the actual relative coin difficulty.\n\n### Reset\n\n1. App will terminate the miner.\n2. App will run the reset script, if it is set.\n3. App will restart itself.\n\n### Watchdog\n\n1. App will periodically check the actual hashrate\n2. If the actual hashrate is lower than the specified threshold in the settings, that will be an overshot.\n3. If you get more consecutive overshots than allowed (specified in the settings) than the app will perform a reset.\n\n# Credits\n\n* [fireice-uk\'s and psychocrypt\'s Xmr-Stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak)\n* [Gandalph3000\'s Cast XMR](http://www.gandalph3000.com/)\n* [doktor83\'s SRBMiner](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3167363.0)\n* [JCE Miner](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3281187.0)\n* [MineCryptoNight API](http://minecryptonight.net/api)\n* [CryptUnit API](https://www.cryptunit.com/api/)\n* [miner.rocks API](https://miner.rocks/)\n* [cryptoknight.cc API](https://cryptoknight.cc/)\n* [HeroMiners API](https://herominers.com/)\n* [MoneroOcean API](https://moneroocean.stream)\n* [NiceHash API](https://www.nicehash.com/doc-api)\n* [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)\n* [CsConsoleFormat](https://github.com/Athari/CsConsoleFormat)\n* [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json)\n\n'
