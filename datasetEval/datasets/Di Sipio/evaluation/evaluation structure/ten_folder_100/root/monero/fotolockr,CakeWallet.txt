We do this ONLY for more convenient installation process. Changes which we did in [ofxiOSBoost](https://github.com/fotolockr/ofxiOSBoost), [monero](https://github.com/fotolockr/monero) and [monero-gui](https://github.com/fotolockr/monero-gui) you can see in commit history in "build" branch of these repositories.\n\n**Cake Technologies LLC.**\n'
