The author stole the idea from [Chen Luo](https://twitter.com/chenluois)\xe2\x80\x99s [Mou](http://mouapp.com) so that people can make crappy clones.\n\nVisit the [project site](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for more information, or download [MacDown.app.zip](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/download/latest/) directly from the [latest releases](https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown/releases/latest) page.\n\n## Install\n\n[Download](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/download/latest/), unzip, and drag the app to Applications folder. MacDown is also available through [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/):\n\n    brew cask install macdown\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![screenshot](assets/screenshot.png)\n\n## License\n\nMacDown is released under the terms of MIT License. You may find the content of the license [here](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), or inside the `LICENSE` directory.\n\nYou may find full text of licenses about third-party components in the `LICENSE` directory, or the **About MacDown** panel in the application.\n\nThe following editor themes and CSS files are extracted from [Mou](http://mouapp.com), courtesy of Chen Luo:\n\n* Mou Fresh Air\n* Mou Fresh Air+\n* Mou Night\n* Mou Night+\n* Mou Paper\n* Mou Paper+\n* Tomorrow\n* Tomorrow Blue\n* Tomorrow+\n* Writer\n* Writer+\n* Clearness\n* Clearness Dark\n* GitHub\n* GitHub2\n\n## Development\n\n### Requirements\n\nIf you wish to build MacDown yourself, you will need the following components/tools:\n\n* OS X SDK (10.8 or later)\n* Git\n* [Bundler](http://bundler.io)\n\nYou may also need to install Xcode\xe2\x80\x99s command line tools with the following command:\n\n    xcode-select --install\n\n> Note: Due to multiple upstream bugs, Xcode may fail to build certain dependencies if you use the CocoaPods with versions lower than 0.39. Please upgrade CocoaPods, or use Bundler to execute a local version (as suggested above) instead.\n\nAn appropriate SDK should be bundled with Xcode 5 or later versions.\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nAfter cloning the repository, run the following commands inside the repository root (directory containing this `README.md` file):\n\n    git submodule init\n    git submodule update\n    bundle install\n    bundle exec pod install\n\nand open `MacDown.xcworkspace` in Xcode. The first command initialises the dependency submodule(s) used in MacDown; the second one installs dependencies managed by CocoaPods.\n\nRefer to the official guides of Git and CocoaPods if you need more instructions. If you run into build issues later on, try running the following commands to update dependencies:\n\n    git submodule update\n    bundle exec pod install\n\n### Translation\n\nPlease help translation on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/macdown/macdown/).\n\n![Transifex translation percentage](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/macdown/resource/macdownxliff/chart/image_png/)\n\n## Discussion\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/MacDownApp/macdown)\n\nJoin our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/MacDownApp/macdown) if you have any problems with MacDown. Any suggestions are welcomed, too!\n\nYou can also [file an issue directly](https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown/issues/new) on GitHub if you prefer so. But please, **search first to make sure no-one has reported the same issue already** before opening one yourself. MacDown does not update in your computer immediately when we make changes, so something you experienced might be known, or even fixed in the development version.\n\nMacDown depends a lot on other open source projects, such as [Hoedown](https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown) for Markdown-to-HTML rendering, [Prism](http://prismjs.com) for syntax highlighting (in code blocks), and [PEG Markdown Highlight](https://github.com/ali-rantakari/peg-markdown-highlight) for editor highlighting. If you find problems when using those particular features, you can also consider reporting them directly to upstream projects as well as to MacDown\xe2\x80\x99s issue tracker. I will do what I can if you report it here, but sometimes it can be more beneficial to interact with them directly.\n\n## Tipping\n\nIf you find MacDown suitable for your needs, please consider [giving me a tip through PayPal](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/faq/#donation). Or, if you prefer to buy me a drink *personally* instead, just [send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/uranusjr) when you visit [Taipei, Taiwan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei), where I live. I look forward to meeting you!\n\n'
