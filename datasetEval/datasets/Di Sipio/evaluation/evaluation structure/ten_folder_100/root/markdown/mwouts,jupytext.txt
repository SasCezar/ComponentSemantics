Wished you could edit them in your favorite IDE? And get clear and meaningful diffs when doing version control? Then... Jupytext may well be the tool you\'re looking for!\n\nJupytext can save Jupyter notebooks as\n- Markdown and R Markdown documents,\n- Scripts in many languages.\n\nIt can also convert these documents **into** Jupyter\nNotebooks, allowing you to synchronize content in both\ndirections.\n\nThe languages that are currently supported by Jupytext are: Julia, Python, R, Bash, Scheme, Clojure, Matlab, Octave, C++, q/kdb+, IDL, TypeScript, Javascript, Scala, Rust/Evxcr, PowerShell and Robot Framework. Extending Jupytext to more languages should be easy - read more at [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). In addition, jupytext users can choose between two formats for notebooks as scripts:\n- The `percent` format, compatible with several IDEs, including Spyder, Hydrogen, VScode and PyCharm. In that format, cells are delimited with a commented `%%`.\n- The `light` format, designed for this project. Use that format to open standard scripts as notebooks, or to save notebooks as scripts with few cell markers - none when possible.\n\n**For more complete information see [the jupytext FAQ](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html) and [the jupytext documentation](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io)**\n\n\n## Try Jupytext\n\n[![Introducing Jupytext](https://img.shields.io/badge/TDS-Introducing%20Jupytext-blue.svg)](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-jupytext-9234fdff6c57)\n[![PyParis](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-PyParis-red.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-VEZenk824)\n[![CFM insights](https://img.shields.io/badge/CFM%20insights-Jupytext%20&%20Papermill-00ab6c.svg)](https://medium.com/capital-fund-management/automated-reports-with-jupyter-notebooks-using-jupytext-and-papermill-619e60c37330)\n[![Binder](https://img.shields.io/badge/Binder-Try%20it!-blue.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mwouts/jupytext/master?urlpath=lab/tree/demo/get_started.ipynb)\n\nLooking for a demo?\n- Read the original [announcement](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-jupytext-9234fdff6c57) in _Towards Data Science_ (Sept. 2018),\n- Watch the [PyParis talk](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext_pyparis_2018/blob/master/README.md) (Nov. 2018),\n- Read our article on [Jupytext and Papermill](https://medium.com/capital-fund-management/automated-reports-with-jupyter-notebooks-using-jupytext-and-papermill-619e60c37330) in _CFM Insights_ (Sept. 2019)\n- or, try Jupytext online with [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mwouts/jupytext/master?urlpath=lab/tree/demo/get_started.ipynb)!\n\n## Installation\n\n[![Conda Version](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/jupytext.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jupytext)\n[![Pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/jupytext.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jupytext)\n[![pyversions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/jupytext.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jupytext)\n\nJupytext is available on pypi and on conda-forge. Run either of\n```bash\npip install jupytext --upgrade\n```\nor\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge jupytext\n```\n\nIf you want to use Jupytext within Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, make sure you install Jupytext in the Python environment where the Jupyter server runs. If that environment is read-only, for instance if your server is started using JupyterHub, install Jupytext in user mode with:\n```\n/path_to_your_jupyter_environment/python -m pip install jupytext --upgrade --user\n```\n\n### Jupytext\'s contents manager\n\nJupytext provides a contents manager for Jupyter that allows Jupyter to open and save notebooks as text files. When Jupytext\'s content manager is active in Jupyter, scripts and Markdown documents have a notebook icon.\n\nIn most cases, Jupytext\'s contents manager is activated automatically by Jupytext\'s server extension. When you restart either `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`, you should see a line that looks like:\n```bash\n[I 10:28:31.646 LabApp] [Jupytext Server Extension] Changing NotebookApp.contents_manager_class from LargeFileManager to jupytext.TextFileContentsManager\n```\n\nIf you don\'t have the notebook icon on text documents after a fresh restart of your Jupyter server, you can either enable our server extension explicitly (with `jupyter serverextension enable jupytext`), or install the contents manager manually. Append\n```python\nc.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = "jupytext.TextFileContentsManager"\n```\nto your `.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` file (generate a Jupyter config, if you don\'t have one yet, with `jupyter notebook --generate-config`). Our contents manager accepts a few options: default formats, default metadata filter, etc. Then, restart Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, either from the JupyterHub interface or from the command line with\n```bash\njupyter notebook # or lab\n```\n\n### Jupytext menu in Jupyter Notebook\n\nJupytext includes an extensions for Jupyter Notebook that adds a Jupytext section in the File menu.\n\n![Jupyter notebook extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwouts/jupytext_nbextension/master/jupytext_menu.png)\n\nIf the extension was not automatically installed, install and activate it with\n```\njupyter nbextension install --py jupytext [--user]\njupyter nbextension enable --py jupytext [--user]\n```\n\n### Jupytext commands in JupyterLab\n\nIn JupyterLab, Jupytext adds a set of commands to the command palette:\n\n![JupyterLab extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwouts/jupyterlab-jupytext/master/jupytext_commands.png)\n\nThe lab extension is included in the Python package. Unless you need to use an older version of the extension you don\'t have to either install or update the extension manually from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). \n \nIf you are wondering why the npm and the Python packages have different version, it\'s because the npm package is updated less often than the Python one. The latest versions are respectively [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/jupyterlab-jupytext.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/jupyterlab-jupytext) and [![Pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/jupytext.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jupytext). \n\nInstalling Jupytext will trigger a build of JupyterLab the next time you open it. If you prefer, you can trigger the build manually with\n```\njupyter lab build\n```\n\nThe version of the extension that is shipped with Jupytext requires JupyterLab 1.0. If you prefer to continue using JupyterLab in version 0.35, you should install the version 0.19 of the extension:\n```\njupyter labextension install jupyterlab-jupytext@0.19\n``` \n\n## Using Jupytext\n\n### Paired notebooks in the Jupyter Server\n\nJupytext can write a given notebook to multiple files. In addition to the original notebook file, Jupytext can save the input cells to a text file &mdash; either a script or a Markdown document. Put the text file under version control for a clear commit history. Or refactor the paired script, and reimport the updated input cells by simply refreshing the notebook in Jupyter.\n\n### Configuring notebooks to use Jupytext\n\nSelect the pairing for a given notebook using either the [Jupytext menu](#jupytext-menu-in-jupyter-notebook) in Jupyter Notebook, or the [Jupytext commands](#jupytext-commands-in-jupyterlab) in JupyterLab.\n\nAlternatively, the pairing information for one or multiple notebooks can be set on the command line:\n```\njupytext --set-formats ipynb,py notebook.ipynb\n```\n\nFor more information see [the jupytext documentation](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io).\n\n### Command line conversion\n\nThe package provides a `jupytext` script for command line conversion between the various notebook extensions:\n\n```bash\njupytext --to py notebook.ipynb                 # convert notebook.ipynb to a .py file\njupytext --to notebook notebook.py              # convert notebook.py to an .ipynb file with no outputs\njupytext --to notebook --execute notebook.md    # convert notebook.md to an .ipynb file and run it \njupytext --update --to notebook notebook.py     # update the input cells in the .ipynb file and preserve outputs and metadata\njupytext --set-formats ipynb,py notebook.ipynb  # Turn notebook.ipynb into a paired ipynb/py notebook\njupytext --sync notebook.ipynb                  # Update all paired representations of notebook.ipynb\n```\n\nFor more examples, see the [jupytext documentation](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io)\n\n## Want to contribute?\n\nContributions are welcome.
