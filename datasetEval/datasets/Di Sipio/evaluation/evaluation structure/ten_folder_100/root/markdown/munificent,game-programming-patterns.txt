b"**Note: Now that the book is done, I'm not actively working on it.**\n\nThere are only so many hours in the day, and I have other projects that need my\nlove, including a new book. This means I'm not responding to issues and pull\nrequests here. However, I do intend to circle back and do a second edition at\n*some* point, so please do continue to file bugs.\n\nEven though I'm not responding, I do deeply appreciate every issue filed.\nThank you!\n\n&ndash; bob\n\n---\n\nThis is the source repo for the book [Game Programming Patterns][].\n\n## Building the Book\n\nThe book is written in Markdown (in `book/`). A little Python script (`script/format.py`) converts that along with a SASS file (`asset/style.scss`) and HTML template (`asset/template.html`) to the final HTML (in `html/`). To run the format script locally, you'll need to have Python 2.7-ish, and install Python Markdown, Pygments, and SmartyPants:\n\n    $ pip install markdown\n    $ pip install pygments\n    $ pip install smartypants\n\nYou may need `sudo` for those. Once that's done, you can run:\n\n    $ python script/format.py\n\nMake sure to run this from the root directory of the repo. That will regenerate all of the chapter and section intro HTML files. If you're editing stuff, the script can also be run in watch mode:\n\n    $ python script/format.py --watch\n\nThat will monitor the file system for changes to the markdown files, SASS file, or HTML template, and reprocess them as needed.\n\n[game programming patterns]: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/\n"
