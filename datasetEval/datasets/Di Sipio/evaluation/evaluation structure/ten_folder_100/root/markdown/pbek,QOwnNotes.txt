Out of this need **QOwnNotes** was born.\n\nVisit the project page here: [QOwnNotes project page](https://www.qownnotes.org)\n\nTo manage your **todo lists** in the web and on your mobile devices, you need to install the Tasks backend on [ownCloud](https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/tasks) or [Nextcloud](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/tasks).\n\nTo get more on-line features for your notes, like **versioning** and **trash** access, you might also want to install the [QOwnNotesAPI](https://github.com/pbek/qownnotesapi) app on your server.\n\nTo access your ownCloud notes from your **mobile device** you may want to get these:\n- For Android and OwnCloud: [MyOwnNotes](https://f-droid.org/app/org.aykit.MyOwnNotes)\n- For Android and Nextcloud: [Notes](https://f-droid.org/packages/it.niedermann.owncloud.notes)\n- For iOS: [CloudNotes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/cloudnotes-owncloud-notes/id813973264)\n\nOn Android you could also use any sync-tool like *Synchronize Ultimate* or *FolderSync* to sync your note files and use software like *neutriNotes* or [**Markor**](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.gsantner.markor/) to edit your notes.\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Screenhot](screenshots/screenshot.png)\n\nYou can visit the [QOwnNotes project page](https://www.qownnotes.org) for more **screenshots**.\n\n## Features\n\n- **multiple note folders** can be used\n- you can **use your existing text or markdown files**, no need for an import most of the times\n- older **versions of your notes** can be restored from your Nextcloud / ownCloud server (install [QOwnNotesAPI](https://github.com/pbek/qownnotesapi) on your server)\n- **trashed notes** can be restored from your Nextcloud / ownCloud server (install [QOwnNotesAPI](https://github.com/pbek/qownnotesapi) on your server)\n    - there also is a local trash\n- sub-string searching of notes is possible and search results are highlighted in the notes\n- application can be operated with **customizable keyboard shortcuts**\n- external changes of note files are watched (notes or note list are reloaded)\n- differences between current note and externally changed note are shown in a dialog\n- **markdown highlighting** of notes and a markdown **preview**\n- **[spellchecking](https://docs.qownnotes.org/en/develop/spellchecking.html)** support\n- scripting support and an online [script repository](https://github.com/qownnotes/scripts)\n  where you can install scripts inside the application\n- [QOwnNotes Web Companion browser extension](https://github.com/qownnotes/web-companion)\n  to a add notes from the selected text and other features\n\t- visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/qownnotes-web-companion/pkgkfnampapjbopomdpnkckbjdnpkbkp)\n\t  page to install the app on Google Chrome\n\t- visit the [Firefox Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/qownnotes-web-companion)\n\t  page to install the app on Mozilla Firefox\n- notes are getting their name from the first line of the note text (just like in the Nextcloud / ownCloud notes web-application) and the note text files are automatically renamed, if the the first line changes\n    - this feature can also be turned off and you can use any filename you like\n- manage your Nextcloud / ownCloud todo lists (ownCloud tasks or Tasks Plus / Calendar Plus)\n- **encryption of notes** (AES-256 is built in or you can use custom encryption methods like\n  **[Keybase.io](https://keybase.io)** ([encryption-keybase.qml](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/blob/develop/doc/scripting/encryption-keybase.qml)) or\n  **PGP** ([encryption-pgp.qml](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/blob/develop/doc/scripting/encryption-pgp.qml)))\n- **dark mode** theme support\n- all **panels can be placed wherever you want**, they can even float or stack (fully dockable)\n- **toolbars** are **fully customizable**\n- support for **freedesktop theme icons**, so you can use QOwnNotes with your\n  native desktop icons and with your favorite dark desktop theme\n  QOwnNotes supports Freedesktop icon themes\n- support for hierarchical **note tagging** and **note subfolders**\n- support for **sharing notes** on your Nextcloud / ownCloud server\n- **portable mode** for carrying QOwnNotes around on USB sticks\n- **Vim mode**\n- **distraction free mode**, **full-screen mode**, **typewriter mode**\n- Evernote import\n- QOwnNotes is **available in many different languages** like English, German, French, Polish, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, Hungarian, Dutch and Spanish\n\t- [Your help](https://www.qownnotes.org/Knowledge-base/How-can-I-help-to-translate-QOwnNotes) is very much appreciated to improve these translations or to translate QOwnNotes in more languages\n\t- Join the fun at **[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/qownnotes/invite)** to **help** with the **translations**\n\n## Building QOwnNotes\n\nTo get the most current features you can build the application from the source\ncode.
