b'Welcome to ReText!\n==================\n\n[![Travis CI status][Travis SVG]][Travis]\n[![Appveyor CI status][Appveyor SVG]][Appveyor]\n\nReText is a simple but powerful editor for Markdown and reStructuredText markup\nlanguages. ReText is written in Python language and works on Linux and other\nPOSIX-compatible platforms. To install ReText from the cloned repository, use\n`setup.py install` command (by default it installs system wide, pass the\n`--user` option for installing into the user\xe2\x80\x99s home directory).\n\n![ReText on Plasma 5 desktop](data/retext-kde5.png)\n\nYou can read more about ReText in the [wiki].\n\nReText requires the following packages to run:\n\n* [python](https://www.python.org/) \xe2\x80\x94 version 3.4 or higher\n* [pyqt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) \xe2\x80\x94 version 5.6 or\n  higher\n* [python-markups](https://pypi.org/project/Markups/) \xe2\x80\x94 version 2.0 or higher\n\nWe also recommend having these packages installed:\n\n* [python-markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/) \xe2\x80\x94 for Markdown\n  language support\n* [python-docutils](https://pypi.org/project/docutils/) \xe2\x80\x94 for reStructuredText\n  language support\n* [python-enchant](https://pypi.org/project/pyenchant/) \xe2\x80\x94 for spell checking\n  support\n\nThe latest stable version of ReText can be downloaded from [PyPI].
