b"# kramdown\n\n## Readme first!\n\nkramdown was originally licensed under the GPL until the 1.0.0 release. However, due to the many\nrequests it is now released under the MIT license and therefore can easily be used in commercial\nprojects, too.\n\nHowever, if you use kramdown in a commercial setting, please consider **contributing back any\nchanges** for the benefit of the community and/or\n[**becoming a patron**](https://www.patreon.com/gettalong) - thanks!\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nkramdown is a fast, pure Ruby Markdown superset converter, using a strict syntax definition and\nsupporting several common extensions.\n\nThe syntax definition for the kramdown syntax can be found in **doc/syntax.page** (or online at\n<http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html>) and a quick reference is available in\n**doc/quickref.page** or online at <http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html>.\n\nThe kramdown library is mainly written to support the kramdown-to-HTML conversion chain. However,\ndue to its flexibility (by creating an internal AST) it supports other input and output formats as\nwell. Here is a list of the supported formats:\n\n* input formats: kramdown (a Markdown superset), Markdown, GFM, HTML\n* output formats: HTML, kramdown, LaTeX (and therefore PDF), PDF via Prawn\n\nAll the documentation on the available input and output formats is available in the **doc/**\ndirectory and online at <http://kramdown.gettalong.org>.\n\nStarting from version 1.0.0 kramdown is using a versioning scheme with major, minor and patch parts\nin the version number where the major number changes on backwards-incompatible changes, the minor\nnumber on the introduction of new features and the patch number on everything else.\n\nFor information about changes between versions, have a look at\n<http://kramdown.gettalong.org/news.html> or the commit history!\n\n\n## Usage\n\nkramdown has a very simple API, so using kramdown is as easy as\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'kramdown'\n\nKramdown::Document.new(text).to_html\n```\n\nFor detailed information have a look at the API documentation of the `Kramdown::Document` class.\n\nThe full API documentation is available at <http://kramdown.gettalong.org/rdoc/>, other sites with an\nAPI documentation for kramdown probably don't provide the complete documentation!\n\nThere are also some third-party libraries that extend the functionality of kramdown -- see the\nkramdown Wiki at <https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/wiki>.\n\n\n## Development\n\nJust clone the git repository as described in **doc/installation.page** and you are good to go. You\nprobably want to install `rake` so that you can use the provided rake tasks.\n\nIf you want to run the tests, the development dependencies are needed as well as some additional\nprograms like `tidy` and `latex`. See the `.travis.yml` file for more information.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT - see the **COPYING** file.\n"
