It is based on the [CommonMark JS reference implementation][commonmark.js] by [John MacFarlane] \\([@jgm]\\).\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x93\xa6 Installation & Basic Usage\n\nThis project can be installed via [Composer]:\n\n``` bash\n$ composer require league/commonmark\n```\n\nThe `CommonMarkConverter` class provides a simple wrapper for converting CommonMark to HTML:\n\n```php\nuse League\\CommonMark\\CommonMarkConverter;\n\n$converter = new CommonMarkConverter([\n    \'html_input\' => \'strip\',\n    \'allow_unsafe_links\' => false,\n]);\n\necho $converter->convertToHtml(\'# Hello World!\');\n\n// <h1>Hello World!</h1>\n```\n\nPlease note that only UTF-8 and ASCII encodings are supported.  If your Markdown uses a different encoding please convert it to UTF-8 before running it through this library.\n\n\xf0\x9f\x94\x92 If you will be parsing untrusted input from users, please consider setting the `html_input` and `allow_unsafe_links` options per the example above. See <https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/security/> for more details. If you also do choose to allow raw HTML input from untrusted users, considering using a library (like [HTML Purifier](https://github.com/ezyang/htmlpurifier)) to provide additional HTML filtering.\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x93\x93 Documentation\n\nFull documentation on advanced usage, configuration, and customization can be found at [commonmark.thephpleague.com][docs].\n\n## \xe2\x8f\xab Upgrading\n\nInformation on how to upgrade to newer versions of this library can be found at <https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/releases>.\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x97\x83\xef\xb8\x8f Related Packages\n\n### Integrations\n\n- [CakePHP 3](https://github.com/gourmet/common-mark)\n- [Drupal 7 & 8](https://www.drupal.org/project/markdown)\n- [Laravel 4 & 5](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Markdown)\n- [Sculpin](https://github.com/bcremer/sculpin-commonmark-bundle)\n- [Symfony 2 & 3](https://github.com/webuni/commonmark-bundle)\n- [Symfony 4](https://github.com/avensome/commonmark-bundle)\n- [Twig Markdown extension](https://github.com/twigphp/markdown-extension)\n- [Twig filter and tag](https://github.com/aptoma/twig-markdown)\n\n### GFM Extensions\n\nYou can easily add support for Github-Flavored Markdown by installing the [`league/commonmark-extras`](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark-extras) package, which includes bundles all of the extensions listed below:\n\n| Feature | Package Name | Description |\n| ------- | ------------ | ----------- |\n| Autolinks | [`league/commonmark-ext-autolink`](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark-ext-autolink) | Automatically links URLs, emails, and (optionally) @-mentions without needing to use `<...>` |\n| Smart Punctuation | [`league/commonmark-ext-smartpunct`](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark-ext-smartpunct) | Intelligently converts ASCII quotes, dashes, and ellipses to their Unicode equivalents |\n| Strikethrough | [`league/commonmark-ext-strikethrough`](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark-ext-strikethrough) | Adds support for `~~strikethrough~~` syntax |\n| Task Lists | [`league/commonmark-ext-task-list`](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark-ext-task-list) | Support for Github-style task lists |\n| Tables | [`league/commonmark-ext-table`](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark-ext-table) | GFM-style tables |\n\n### Other PHP League Extensions\n\n - [`league/commonmark-ext-inlines-only`](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark-ext-inlines-only) - Renders inline text without paragraph tags or other block-level elements\n - [`league/commonmark-ext-external-link`](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark-ext-external-link) - Mark external links, make them open in new windows, etc.\n\nYou can add them to your project or use them as examples to [develop your own custom features](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/customization/overview/).\n\n### Community Extensions\n\nCustom parsers/renderers can be bundled into extensions which extend CommonMark.

Minor and patch releases should not introduce breaking changes to the codebase; however, they might change the resulting AST or HTML output of parsed Markdown (due to bug fixes, spec changes, etc.)  As a result, you might get slightly different HTML, but any custom code built onto this library should still function correctly.\n\nAny classes or methods marked `@internal` are not intended for use outside of this library and are subject to breaking changes at any time, so please avoid using them.\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x9b\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f Maintenance & Support\n\nWhen a new **minor** version (`1.x`) is released, the previous one will continue to receive security and bug fixes for *at least* 3 months.\n\nWhen a new **major** version is released (`1.0`, `2.0`, etc), the previous one (`0.19.x`) will receive bug fixes for *at least* 3 months and security updates for 6 months after that new release comes out.\n\n(This policy may change in the future and exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis.)\n\n**Professional support, including notification of new releases and security updates, is available through a [Tidelift Subscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/packagist-league-commonmark?utm_source=packagist-league-commonmark&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).**\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x91\xb7\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f Contributing\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the [Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security). Tidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure with us.\n\nIf you encounter a bug in the spec, please report it to the [CommonMark] project.  Any resulting fix will eventually be implemented in this project as well.\n\nContributions to this library are **welcome**, especially ones that:\n\n * Improve usability or flexibility without compromising our ability to adhere to the [CommonMark spec]\n * Mirror fixes made to the [reference implementation][commonmark.js]\n * Optimize performance\n * Fix issues with adhering to the [CommonMark spec]\n\nMajor refactoring to core parsing logic should be avoided if possible so that we can easily follow updates made to [the reference implementation][commonmark.js]. That being said, we will absolutely consider changes which don\'t deviate too far from the reference spec or which are favored by other popular CommonMark implementations.\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional details.\n\n## \xf0\x9f\xa7\xaa Testing\n\n``` bash\n$ composer test\n```\n\nThis will also test league/commonmark against the latest supported spec.\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Performance Benchmarks\n\nYou can compare the performance of **league/commonmark** to other popular parsers by running the included benchmark tool:\n\n``` bash\n$ ./tests/benchmark/benchmark.php\n```\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x91\xa5 Credits & Acknowledgements\n\n- [Colin O\'Dell][@colinodell]\n- [John MacFarlane][@jgm]\n- [All Contributors]\n\nThis code is partially based on the [CommonMark JS reference implementation][commonmark.js] which is written, maintained and copyrighted by [John MacFarlane].
