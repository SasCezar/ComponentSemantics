b'Life\r\n====\r\n\r\nThis is something that I\'ve wanted to build for a long time. It\'s a **timeline of important events** in my life, visualized in a way my mind always imagine it. There was something called [**Lifepath.me**](http://dcurt.is/facebook-timelines-and-lifepath-me-4) but now it\'s gone. How about Facebook timeline? Meh.\r\n\r\nSo, this is it. Have a look at [cheeaun.life](http://cheeaun.life/).\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- Super simple\r\n- No fancy formatting\r\n- No fancy setup\r\n- No fancy effects\r\n- Flexible datetimes because sometimes you don\'t remember the exact date of an event\r\n\r\nHow to contribute\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n1. Fork this project.\r\n2. Write code.\r\n3. Make pull requests.\r\n\r\nHow to setup your own *Life*\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n1. Fork this project.\r\n2. `git checkout -b gh-pages` (or any branch name you like)\r\n3. Make a copy of `life.example.md`, rename it to `life.md`.\r\n4. Add your life events into `life.md`.\r\n5. Preview it on a local server. Use [`python -m http.server`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) or [`http-server`](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server).\r\n6. Commit `life.md` (not in `master` branch).\r\n7. `git push origin gh-pages -f` and publish to [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).\r\n8. Update the website link in your GitHub repo description.\r\n9. Tell the world about your Life.\r\n10. Add your Life to the [Lives](https://github.com/cheeaun/life/wiki/Lives) page.\r\n\r\nHow to upgrade your *Life*\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n1. `git checkout master`\r\n2. `git remote add cheeaun https://github.com/cheeaun/life.git`\r\n3. `git fetch cheeaun` and `git merge cheeaun/master` to upgrade to latest Life.\r\n4. `git checkout gh-pages` and `git merge master` to sync changes back to GitHub Pages.\r\n\r\n[Learn more](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).\r\n\r\nFor those who forked the earlier version of Life, these are the steps that I would recommend (requires some Git-fu):\r\n\r\n1. Backup your `life.md`.\r\n2. Reset (hard) your fork to this repo\'s `master` branch.\r\n3. Clean up your `gh-pages`.\r\n4. Re-commit your `life.md` there.\r\n5. Make sure your `master` branch is untouched so that future updates work.\r\n\r\nHow to configure your *Life*\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n1. Make a copy of `config.example.json`, rename it to `config.json`.\r\n2. Only commit it in `gh-pages` branch.\r\n\r\nThe configuration:\r\n\r\n- `customStylesheetURL` - (*string*, default to `null`) Path to a custom stylesheet file, for those who doesn\'t like the default *theme*.\r\n- `yearLength` - (*number*, default to `120`) The width of the year grids, in pixels.\r\n- `hideAge` - (*boolean*, default to `false`) Option to hide age from year axis.\r\n\r\nDatetime "syntax"\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n- `2000` - event that happen in that year\r\n- `01/2000` - event that happen in that month/year\r\n- `01/01/2000` - event that happen exactly in that day/month/year\r\n- `2001-2005`, `10/2001-02/03/2005` - event that happen within the two dates\r\n- `~2005` - event that happen around the time in that year\r\n- `2005-~` - event that happen from that year and beyond (now).\r\n\r\nOther people\'s Lives\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nHere\'s [a compilation of Lives from the people who have forked Life](https://github.com/cheeaun/life/wiki/Lives).\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n[MIT](http://cheeaun.mit-license.org/)\r\n'
