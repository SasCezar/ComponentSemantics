All settings are on sane defaults, you really should know what you do\nif you change them.\n\n#### services.conf\nThis file is used to open ports for services like ssh or http(s) in your firewall.\n\n###### SYNTAX:\n\nPORT/PROTOCOLL SOURCE\nwhere SOURCE is the source ip or network\n\nn.n.n.n/m - Where n.n.n.n is the IP address range and m is the bitmask.\n\nif SOURCE is empty it defaults to 0.0.0.0/0 (which is any IP)\n\n###### EXAMPLEs:\n\nopens ports for SSH for IP 192.168.0.1:\n\n    22/tcp 192.168.0.1\n    22/udp 192.168.0.1\n\nopens ports for HTTP for any IP\n\n    80/tcp 0.0.0.0/0\n\nopens ports for HTTPS for any IP\n\n    443/tcp\n\n#### ip-whitelist.conf:\nAdd all source IPs you want to have full access to this host.\nOne IP per line\n\n###### SYNTAX:\n\nn.n.n.n/m.m.m.m  - Where n.n.n.n is the IP address range and m.m.m.m is the netmask.\n\nn.n.n.n/m - Where n.n.n.n is the IP address range and m is the bitmask.\n\n###### EXAMPLEs:\n\n    192.168.0.1\n    192.168.1.0/8\n    192.168.55.0/255.255.255.148\n    \n#### ip-blacklist.conf:\nAdd all source IPs you want to COMPLETELY BLOCK\nOne IP per line\n\n###### SYNTAX:\n\nn.n.n.n/m.m.m.m  - Where n.n.n.n is the IP address range and m.m.m.m is the netmask.\n\nn.n.n.n/m - Where n.n.n.n is the IP address range and m is the bitmask.\n\n###### EXAMPLEs:\n\n    192.168.0.1\n    192.168.1.0/8\n    192.168.55.0/255.255.255.148\n    \n#### custom/*:\nEvery file/script you place here will be executed during firewall-start.\nPlace your custom rules in here.\n\nThere are some usefull examples in ./custom-examples/ that limit the ammount of new and overall connections.\n\n## Usage\nIf you updated your runlevels, the firewall starts every time you boot your system.\nHowever, you can manually start/stop/restart, e.g. to update changed settings.\n\n    /etc/init.d/firewall (start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload|status)\n\n* start: starts the firewall\n* stop: stops the firewall\n* restart, reload, force-reload: restarts the firewall (all three the same)\n* status: print out the status of the firewall, shows all entries in iptables\n* version: print out the version of iptables-boilerplate\n\n## How to contribute\nfork + hack + pull request please :-)\n\nthx\n\n\n## Licence\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 Bernhard M\xc3\xa4ser(http://bmaeser.io) and contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \xe2\x80\x9cSoftware\xe2\x80\x9d), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \xe2\x80\x9cAS IS\xe2\x80\x9d, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
