b'Suru Icons & Cursors\n====================\n\nThis project is a revitalization of the Suru icon set that was designed for Ubuntu Touch. The principles and styles created for Suru now serve as the basis for a new FreeDesktop icon theme.\n\n## Copying or Reusing\n\nThis project has mixed licencing.

(If you installed it without superuser priveleges just omit the  `sudo`.)\n\n```bash\nsudo ninja -C "build" uninstall\n```\n\nOnce uninstalled you can reset your icon and cursor theme to the default setting by running the following.\n\n```bash\n# reset icon theme to default\ngsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme\n# reset cursor theme to default\ngsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are obviously welcome!
