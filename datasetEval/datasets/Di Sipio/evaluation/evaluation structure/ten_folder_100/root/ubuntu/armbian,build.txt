b'# Armbian #\n\nDebian based Linux for ARM based single-board computers\n  \n[https://www.armbian.com](https://www.armbian.com "Armbian")\n\n\n# How to build an image or a kernel?\n\nSupported build environment is **Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 x64** ([minimal iso image](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/bionic/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso)).\n\n- guest inside a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or other virtualization software,\n- guest managed by [Vagrant](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Using-Vagrant/). This uses Virtualbox (as above) but does so in an easily repeatable way,\n- inside a [Docker](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Building-with-Docker/), [systemd-nspawn](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html) or other container environment [(example)](https://github.com/armbian/build/pull/255#issuecomment-205045273),\n- running natively on a dedicated PC or a server (**not** recommended),\n- **25GB disk space** or more and **2GB RAM** or more available for the VM, container or native OS,\n- superuser rights (configured `sudo` or root access).\n\n**Execution**\n\n\tapt-get -y install git\n\tgit clone https://github.com/armbian/build\n\tcd build\n\t./compile.sh\n\nMake sure that full path to the build script does not contain spaces.\n\nYou will be prompted with a selection menu for a build option, a board name, a kernel branch and an OS release. Please check the documentation for [advanced options](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Build-Options/) and [additional customization](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_User-Configurations/).\n\nBuild process uses caching for the compilation and the debootstrap process, so consecutive runs with similar settings will be much faster.\n\n# How to report issues?\n\nPlease read [this](https://github.com/igorpecovnik/lib/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) notice first before opening an issue.\n\n# How to contribute?\n\n- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project\n- Make one or more well commented and clean commits to the repository. \n- Perform a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) in github\'s web interface.\n\nIf it is a new feature request, don\'t start the coding first. Remember to [open an issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to discuss the new feature.\n\nIf you are struggling, check [this detailed step by step guide on contributing](https://www.exchangecore.com/blog/contributing-concrete5-github/).\n\n## Where to get more info?\n\n- [Documentation](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Build-Preparation/ "Developer resources")\n- [Prebuilt images](https://www.armbian.com/download/ "Download section")\n- [Support forums](https://forum.armbian.com/ "Armbian support forum")\n'
