b'GRUB2 Live ISO Multiboot\n========================\n\nhttps://github.com/thias/glim | http://glee.thias.es/GLIM\n\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nGLIM is a set of grub configuration files to turn a simple VFAT formatted USB\nmemory stick with many GNU/Linux distribution ISO images into a neat device\nfrom which many different Live environments can be used.\n\nAdvantages over extracting files or using special Live USB creation tools :\n\n * A single USB memory can hold all Live environments (the limit is its size)\n * ISO images stay available to burn real CDs or DVDs\n * ISO images are quick to manipulate (vs. hundreds+ files)\n\nDisadvantages :\n\n * There is no persistence overlay for distributions which normally support it\n * Setting up isn\'t as easy as a simple cat from the ISO image to a block device\n\nMy experience has been that the safest filesystem to use is FAT32\n(surprisingly!), though it will mean that ISO images greater than 4GB won\'t be\nsupported. Other filesystems supported by GRUB2 also work, such as ext3/ext4\nand even NTFS, but the boot of the distributions must also support it, which\nisn\'t the case for many with NTFS, for instance. So FAT32 stays the safe bet.\n\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n![Main Menu](https://github.com/thias/glim/raw/master/screenshots/GLIM-3.0-shot1.png)\n![Ubuntu Submenu](https://github.com/thias/glim/raw/master/screenshots/GLIM-3.0-shot2.png)\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nOnce you have your USB memory with a single partition formatted as FAT32 with\nthe filesystem label \'GLIM\', just run (as a normal user) :\n\n    ./glim.sh\n\nOnce finished, you may change the filesystem label to anything you like.\n\nThe supported `boot/iso/` sub-directories (in alphabetical order) are :\n\n    antergos\n    antix\n    arch\n    bodhi\n    centos\n    clonezilla\n    debian\n    elementary\n    fedora\n    gparted\n    grml\n    ipxe\n    kali\n    linuxmint\n    manjaro\n    netrunner\n    peppermint\n    porteus\n    rhel\n    sabayon\n    supergrub2disk\n    sysrescd\n    tails\n    ubuntu\n    void\n    xubuntu\n\nAny missing sub-directory will have the matching boot menu entry automatically\ndisabled, so to skip any distribution, just don\'t create the directory.\n\nDownload the right ISO images to the newly created directory. If you require\ndifferent versions, or just part of a distribution, edit the appropriate\n`boot/grub2/inc-*.cfg` file.\n\nNote that on 32bit computers, all 64bit entries will be automatically hidden.\n\n\nSpecial Cases\n-------------\n\n### LibreELEC\n\nLibreELEC isn\'t provided as ISO images, nor is it able to find the `KERNEL` and\n`SYSTEM` files it needs anywhere else than at the root of a filesystem.\nBut it\'s useful to enable booting the installer by just copying both\nfiles to the root of the USB memory stick.\nLive booting is also supported, and the first launch will create a 512MB file\nas /STORAGE.\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nWith KVM it should "just work". The `/dev/sdx` device should be configured as\nan IDE or SATA disk (for some reason, as USB disk didn\'t work for me on Fedora\n17), that way you can easily and quickly test changes.\nMake sure you unmount the disk from the host OS before you start the KVM\nvirtual machine that uses it.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nIf you have any problem to boot, for instance stuck at the GRUB prompt before\nthe menu, try re-installing.\nIf you have other exotic GRUB errors, such as garbage text read instead of the\nconfiguration directives, try re-formatting your USB memory from scratch.\nI\'ve seen weird things happen...\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nIf you find GLIM useful but the configuration of the OS you require is missing\nor simply outdated, please feel free to contribute! What you will need is\ncreate a GitHub pull request which includes :\n * All changes properly and fully tested.\n * New entries added similarly to the existing ones :\n   * In alphabetical order.\n   * With all possible relevant variants (i.e. not just the one spin you want).\n * An original icon of high quality, and a shrunk 24x24 px version.\n * An updated supported directories list in this README file.\n\n\n---\nCopyleft 2012-2017 Matthias Saou http://matthias.saou.eu/\n\nAll configuration files included are public domain.
