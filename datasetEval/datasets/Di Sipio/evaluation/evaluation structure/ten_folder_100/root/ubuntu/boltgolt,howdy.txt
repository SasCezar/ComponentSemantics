Use your built-in IR emitters and camera in combination with facial recognition to prove who you are.\n\nUsing the central authentication system (PAM), this works everywhere you would otherwise need your password: Login, lock screen, sudo, su, etc.\n\n## Installation\n\nHowdy is currently available and packaged for Debian/Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Fedora and openSUSE. If you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in packaging Howdy for your distro, don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to open an issue.\n\n**Note:** The build of dlib can hang on 100% for over a minute, give it time.\n\n### Ubuntu or Linux Mint\n\nRun the installer by pasting (`ctrl+shift+V`) the following commands into the terminal one at a time:\n\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:boltgolt/howdy\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install howdy\n```\n\nThis will guide you through the installation.\n\n### Debian\n\nDownload the .deb file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy/releases) and install with gdebi.\n\n### Arch Linux\n_Maintainer wanted._\n\nInstall the `howdy` package from the AUR. For AUR installation instructions, take a look at this [wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages).\n\nYou will need to do some additional configuration steps. Please read the [ArchWiki entry](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Howdy) for more information.\n\n### Fedora\n_Maintainer: [@luyatshimbalanga](https://github.com/luyatshimbalanga)_\n\nThe `howdy` package is available as a [Fedora COPR repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/luya/howdy/), install it by simply executing the following commands in a terminal:\n\n```\nsudo dnf copr enable luya/howdy\nsudo dnf install howdy\n```\n\n### openSUSE\n_Maintainer: [@dmafanasyev](https://github.com/dmafanasyev)_\n\nGo to the [openSUSE wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Facial_authentication) for detailed installation instructions. \n\n## Setup\n\nAfter installation, Howdy needs needs to learn what you look like so it can recognise you later. Run `sudo howdy add` to add a face model.\n\nIf nothing went wrong we should be able to run sudo by just showing your face. Open a new terminal and run `sudo -i` to see it in action. Please check [this wiki page](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy/wiki/Common-issues) if you\'ve experiencing problems or [search](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy/issues) for similar issues.\n\nIf you\'re curious you can run `sudo howdy config` to open the central config file and see the options Howdy has to offer. On most systems this will open the nano editor, where you have to press `ctrl`+`x` to save your changes.\n\n## CLI\n\nThe installer adds a `howdy` command to manage face models for the current user. Use `howdy --help` or `man howdy` to list the available options.\n\nUsage:\n```\nhowdy [-U user] [-y] command [argument]\n```\n\n| Command   | Description                                   |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| `add`     | Add a new face model for an user              |\n| `clear`   | Remove all face models for an user            |\n| `config`  | Open the config file in your default editor   |\n| `disable` | Disable or enable howdy                       |\n| `list`    | List all saved face models for an user        |\n| `remove`  | Remove a specific model for an user           |\n| `test`    | Test the camera and recognition methods       |\n\n## Contributing [![](https://img.shields.io/travis/boltgolt/howdy/dev.svg?label=dev%20build)](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy/tree/dev) [![](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/boltgolt/howdy/enhancement.svg?label=feature+requests&colorB=4c1)](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement)\n\nThe easiest ways to contribute to Howdy is by starring the repository and opening GitHub issues for features you\'d like to see. If you want to do more, you can also [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/boltgolt).\n\nCode contributions are also very welcome. If you want to port Howdy to another distro, feel free to open an issue for that too.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nAny python errors get logged directly into the console and should indicate what went wrong. If authentication still fails but no errors are printed you could take a look at the last lines in `/var/log/auth.log` to see if anything has been reported there.\n\nIf you encounter an error that hasn\'t been reported yet, don\'t be afraid to open a new issue.\n\n## A note on security\n\nThis package is in no way as secure as a password and will never be. Although it\'s harder to fool than normal face recognition, a person who looks similar to you or well-printed photo of you could be enough to do it. Howdy is a more quick and convenient way of logging in, not a more secure one.\n\nTo minimize the chance of this program being compromised, it\'s recommended to leave Howdy in `/lib/security` and to keep it read-only.\n\nDO NOT USE HOWDY AS THE SOLE AUTHENTICATION METHOD FOR YOUR SYSTEM.\n\n\n'
