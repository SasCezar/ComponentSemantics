b'# conjure-up [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/conjure-up/conjure-up.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/conjure-up/conjure-up)\n> Installing big software like whoa.\n\n# what it is\n\nEver wanted to get started with Kubernetes, Deep Learning, Big Data but didn\'t want\nto go through pages and pages of "Getting Started" documentation?\n\nThen **conjure-up** is for you!\n\nThis is the runtime application for processing spells to get those **big software**\nsolutions up and going with as little hindrance as possible.\n\n# installation\n\n> Ubuntu and macOS\n\n## Ubuntu\n\n```\n$ sudo snap install conjure-up --classic\n```\n\n## macOS\n\n```\n$ brew install conjure-up\n```\n\n# how to use\n\n## Run the installer interactively\n\nYou may want to learn a little bit about what you\'re installing, right? This\nmethod provides you with a tutorial like approach without being overburdening.\n\nYou can read through descriptions of the software along with ability to set a\nfew config options before deploying. Or, just hold down the enter button and\nit\'ll choose sensible defaults for you.\n\n```\n$ conjure-up\n```\n\n## Run the installer non-interactively (headless mode)\n\nAlready been through the guided tour? Not keen on holding down the enter button\non your keyboard? Not a problem, easily get your **big software** up and running\nwith all the sensible defaults in place.\n\n```\n$ conjure-up canonical-kubernetes localhost\n```\n\nNote that some spells require sudo for certain steps.  When running in headless\nmode, conjure-up should be run with a user with passwordless sudo enabled (or\nsudo should be pre-authorized before invoking conjure-up).\n\n## Destroying deployments\n\n```\n$ conjure-down\n```\n\n# authors\n\n* Adam Stokes <adam.stokes@ubuntu.com>\n* Mike McCracken <mike.mccracken@canonical.com>\n* Cory Johns <cory.johns@canonical.com>\n\n# license\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\n* Copyright (c) 2015-2019 Canonical Ltd.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
