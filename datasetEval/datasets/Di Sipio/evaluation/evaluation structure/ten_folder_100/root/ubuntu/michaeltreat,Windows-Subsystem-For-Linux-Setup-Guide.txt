Please look at the issues tab for more information.\n ___\n\nAn in-depth guide for developers on how to get started with the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\n\n![Microsoft and Linux](https://i.imgur.com/GOij8My.png)\n\nThe Windows Subsystem for Linux feature on Windows 10 enables users to have a Linux enviroment fully integrated into their Windows PC.\n\nFor ~~experienced~~ all developers: This is not a VM, a Dual-boot, or a console wrapper like Git Bash or Cygwin. It is a native POSIX environment directly mounted to your Windows File System.\n\n### Video Guide: \n\nThis guide also has a video walkthrough of it on YouTube where it goes into great detail on each section to help provide you with as much context as possible.\n\nIt\'s recommended you watch the videos while you go through this guide as they will help clairify many of these points with visuals.\n\nLink to the [WSL Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh0yhZV7OrQ-vojQBqSF0RA/).\n\n<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ixqKqHfCDWM" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/ixqKqHfCDWM/0.jpg" alt="Windows Subsystem for Linux Part One: Introduction into WSL"/></a>\n\n---\n\n\n### What this guide covers\n\nBy the end of this guide, you will know:\n\n1.
