Gain root access with `sudo su` followed up with `cd` to place you in your /root directory. Once in your /root directory, type the following to remove your current local QuickBox repositories.\n```\nrm -rf ~/QuickBox\n```\n\n---\n\n### If you are already located on the GitHub repo as of v2.4.9, run the following to easily update to the new v2.5.+ QuickBox/QB repo:\n```\nrm -rf /etc/QuickBox; \\\ngit clone https://github.com/QuickBox/QB /etc/QuickBox; \\\nwget -O /usr/local/bin/quickbox/system/updateQuickBox https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QuickBox/QB/master/packages/system/updateQuickBox; \\\ndos2unix $(find /usr/local/bin/quickbox -type f) && chmod +x $(find /usr/local/bin/quickbox -type f); \\\nupdateQuickBox\n```\n\n### If you have received the following error:\n>`find: \xe2\x80\x98/home/*/.config/deluge\xe2\x80\x99: No such file or directory`\nThis simply means you do not have Deluge installed, there is no further action for you take.\n\n---\n\n> #### NOTE:<br>The continuation below explains the above all-in-one code, minus the removal of the recent locations at `/root/QuickBox`\n\n### [2]:\ngrab the current/future QuickBox repository with the following:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/QuickBox/QB /etc/QuickBox\n```\n\n>If you receive an error `/etc/QuickBox already exists` please perform an `rm -rf /etc/QuickBox`.

As such, it is highly recommended to use the stock kernel for your distribution or at the very least installing an OVH kernel that is not compiled with grsec\n<br>If you are using So You Start (SYS) as a host, you should opt to use the distribution kernel. You will see this as a check box option when installing your server. Otherwise, QuickBox will handle this for you on install.\n\n\n\n---\n> Please understand that we do not want to push this project as a means to supply a commercially used product, ie; seedbox provider - so keep this in mind - only if you wish to sale slots on your server. Though it is very multi-user friendly... it is also not free of it\'s faults due to it\'s high amount of capabilities and being publicly available. This is a community based project that is a measure of goodwill to be given to such an outspoken and freethinking community.\n\n### A Preview of Quick Box\n![QuickBox Preview - Smoked Theme](https://github.com/QuickBox/quickbox_github_assets/blob/master/img/quickbox_preview-theme_smoked.gif "QuickBox Preview - Smoked Theme")\n\n---\n\nThis script has the following features\n\n* A multi-user environment, complete with scripts to add and delete users.\n* Linux Quota, to control how much space every user can use in the box.
