The Firebase\nAdmin Node.js SDK enables access to Firebase services from privileged environments\n(such as servers or cloud) in Node.js.\n\nFor more information, visit the\n[Firebase Admin SDK setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup/).\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThe Firebase Admin Node.js SDK is available on npm as `firebase-admin`:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install --save firebase-admin\n```\n\nTo use the module in your application, `require` it from any JavaScript file:\n\n```js\nvar admin = require("firebase-admin");\n```\n\nIf you are using ES2015, you can `import` the module instead:\n\n```js\nimport * as admin from "firebase-admin";\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease refer to the [CONTRIBUTING page](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information\nabout how you can contribute to this project. We welcome bug reports, feature\nrequests, code review feedback, and also pull requests.\n\n\n## Supported Environments\n\nWe support Node.js 8.13.0 and higher.\n\nPlease also note that the Admin SDK should only\nbe used in server-side/back-end environments controlled by the app developer.\nThis includes most server and serverless platforms (both on-premise and in\nthe cloud). It is not recommended to use the Admin SDK in client-side\nenvironments.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Setup Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup/)\n* [Database Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/start/)\n* [Authentication Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/)\n* [Cloud Messaging Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/admin/)\n* [API Reference](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/node/)\n* [Release Notes](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/admin/node/)\n\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThanks to the team at [Casetext](https://casetext.com/) for transferring\nownership of the `firebase-admin` npm module over to the Firebase team\nand for their longtime use and support of the Firebase platform.\n\n\n## License\n\nFirebase Admin Node.js SDK is licensed under the\n[Apache License, version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n\nYour use of Firebase is governed by the\n[Terms of Service for Firebase Services](https://firebase.google.com/terms/).\n'
