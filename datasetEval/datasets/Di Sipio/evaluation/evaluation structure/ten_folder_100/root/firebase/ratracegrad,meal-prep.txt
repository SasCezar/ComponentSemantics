b'# meal-prep\n\nThis is the source code for a four-part series I wrote on creating a Vue.js application that also uses Vue-Router, Vuetify and Vuex. The articles take you through creating a Vue application and then adding on to it until you have created a fully functional meal delivery website.\n\nHere is what we create in the articles:  \n![Meal Prep](/screenshots/meal-prep.png?raw=true "Meal Prep")\n\n## Links to the Articles\n\nAs I mentioned this source code is the final code created as part of four articles I wrote on creating a Vue.js application using Vue-Router, Vuex, Vuetify and Firebase. Here are links to each version of the articles:  \n[Part 1](https://medium.com/p/838b40721a07/) - Covers creating the application and adding Vuetify for styling.  \n[Part 2](https://medium.com/p/fc5bd065fe18) - Covers using Vue Router to add navigating between pages in the application.  \n[Part 3](https://medium.com/p/f8036aa464ad/edit) - Covers adding Vuex for state management. Also we connect to a Recipes API to get content for our application.\n[Part 4](https://medium.com/p/d9932d1e4365/edit) - Covers using Firebase for Authentication. Users can create an account and order recipes. When they login to their account they will see their orders.\n\n## Live Demo\n\nI have a live demo of the meal prep application.
