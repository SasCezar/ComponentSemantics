b'# Notational, notes at the speed of thought.\n\nNotational encourages you to keep your hands on the keyboard so you can create, update, and find notes really quickly. The UX is based on the popular macOS app, [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/) (but not affiliated in any way).\n\n![Notational screenshot](screenshot.png)\n\n## Firebase Setup\n\nNotational uses Firebase (it\'s [pretty abstracted so it could change](https://github.com/tmm/notational/blob/master/src/store/api.js)). You can spin up your own instance for testing or local development. [Check out this issue for more info.](https://github.com/tmm/notational/issues/3)\n\nYou will also need to create a `settings.js` file in the root directory that contains your [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) information:\n\n```js\n// settings.js\n\nconst ENV = {\n\tfirebase: {\n\t    apiKey: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",\n\t    authDomain: "YOUR-APP-NAME.firebaseapp.com",\n\t    databaseURL: "https://YOUR-APP-NAME.firebaseio.com",\n\t    storageBucket: "YOUR-APP-NAME.appspot.com",\n\t    messagingSenderId: "XXXXXXXXXXXX"\n\t}\n}\n\nexport default ENV\nglobal.ENV = ENV\n```\n\nThe initial DB schema should look like the following (`default_notes` is the only required key-value pair):\n\n```js\n{\n  "default_notes" : {\n    "notes" : [\n\t    {\n\t      "body" : "Hey-oh!\\n\\nWelcome to Notational \xe2\x80\x93 the fastest note-taking app on the web.\\n\\nNotational makes it easy to keep your hands on the keyboard so you can do things like... type notes really quickly! (See *Useful Shortcuts* above.)\\n\\nAlso, no need to save your work as everything you type (in this box) is ~automagically~ saved.\\n\\n\xe2\x80\x94Tom",\n\t      "date_created" : "Sun Mar 05 2017 18:15:27 GMT-0500",\n\t      "date_modified" : "Sun Mar 05 2017 18:25:02 GMT-0500",\n\t      "id" : 1,\n\t      "name" : "Welcome (Click Me)"\n\t    },\n\t    ...\n    ]\n  },\n  "public_notes" : {\n  \t// Auto created\n  },\n  "users" : {\n  \t// Auto created\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Build Setup\n\n``` bash\n# install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080\nnpm run dev\n\n# build for production with minification\nnpm run build\n\n# deploy on Firebase\nnpm run deploy\n```\n\n## License\n\nReleased under the MIT license.
