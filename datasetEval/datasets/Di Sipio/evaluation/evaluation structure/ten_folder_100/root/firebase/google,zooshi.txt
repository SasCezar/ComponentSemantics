b"Zooshi   {#zooshi_readme}\n======\n\n[Zooshi][] is a game in which players travel on a raft down an endless river\nand toss sushi into the mouths of well-dressed animal patrons.\n\n## Motivation\n\n[Zooshi][] serves as a demonstration of how to build cross-platform\ngames using a suite of open source game technologies from\nFun Propulsion Labs at [Google][] such as [Breadboard][],\n[CORGI][], [FlatBuffers][], [FlatUI][], [fplbase][], [fplutil][],\n[Motive][], [Pindrop][], [Scene Lab][] and [WebP][].\n\n[Zooshi][] also demonstrates how to use the [Google Cardboard][] API, which\nis integrated into [fplbase][].\n\n## Downloading\n\n[Zooshi][] can be downloaded from:\n   * [GitHub][] (source)\n   * [GitHub Releases Page][] (source)\n   * [Google Play][]\n     (binary for Android)\n\n**Important**: [Zooshi][] uses submodules to reference other components it\ndepends upon, so download the source from [GitHub][] using:\n\n~~~{.sh}\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/zooshi.git\n~~~\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee our documentation for how to [Build and Run Zooshi][] and for a\n[Programmer's Guide][] that details the overall structure of the game and all\nof it's subsystems.\n\nTo contribute the this project see [CONTRIBUTING][].\n\nFor applications on Google Play that are derived from this application, usage\nis tracked.\nThis tracking is done automatically using the embedded version string\n(kVersion), and helps us continue to optimize it. Aside from\nconsuming a few extra bytes in your application binary, it shouldn't affect\nyour application at all. We use this information to let us know if Zooshi\nis useful and if we should continue to invest in it. Since this is open\nsource, you are free to remove the version string but we would appreciate if\nyou would leave it in.\n\n  [Android]: https://www.android.com/\n  [Breadboard]: https://google.github.io/breadboard/\n  [Build and Run Zooshi]: https://google.github.io/zooshi/zooshi_guide_building.html\n  [CORGI]: https://google.github.io/corgi/\n  [CONTRIBUTING]: https://github.com/google/zooshi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING\n  [Flatbuffers]: https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/\n  [FlatUI]: https://google.github.io/flatui/\n  [fplbase]: https://google.github.io/fplbase/\n  [fplutil]: https://google.github.io/fplutil/\n  [GitHub]: https://github.com/google/zooshi/\n  [GitHub Releases Page]: https://github.com/google/zooshi/releases\n  [Google]: https://google.com\n  [Google Cardboard]: https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/\n  [Google Play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.fpl.zooshi\n  [Mathfu]: https://google.github.io/mathfu/\n  [Motive]: https://google.github.io/motive/\n  [Pie Noon]: https://google.github.io/pienoon/index.html\n  [Pindrop]: https://google.github.io/pindrop/\n  [Programmer's Guide]: https://google.github.io/zooshi/zooshi_guide_overview.html\n  [Scene Lab]: https://google.github.io/scene_lab/\n  [WebP]: https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/?hl=en\n  [Zooshi]: https://google.github.io/zooshi/\n"
