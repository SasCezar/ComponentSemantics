b"# Firebase iOS Open Source Development [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk)\n\nThis repository contains a subset of the Firebase iOS SDK source. It currently\nincludes FirebaseCore, FirebaseABTesting, FirebaseAuth, FirebaseDatabase,\nFirebaseFirestore, FirebaseFunctions, FirebaseInstanceID, FirebaseInAppMessaging,\nFirebaseInAppMessagingDisplay, FirebaseMessaging, FirebaseRemoteConfig, and\nFirebaseStorage.\n\nThe repository also includes GoogleUtilities source. The\n[GoogleUtilities](GoogleUtilities/README.md) pod is\na set of utilities used by Firebase and other Google products.\n\nFirebase is an app development platform with tools to help you build, grow and\nmonetize your app. More information about Firebase can be found at\n[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com).\n\n## Installation\n\nSee the three subsections for details about three different installation methods.\n1. [Standard pod install](README.md#standard-pod-install)\n1. [Installing from the GitHub repo](README.md#installing-from-github)\n1. [Experimental Carthage](README.md#carthage-ios-only)\n\n### Standard pod install\n\nGo to\n[https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup).\n\n### Installing from GitHub\n\nFor releases starting with 5.0.0, the source for each release is also deployed\nto CocoaPods master and available via standard\n[CocoaPods Podfile syntax](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#pod).\n\nThese instructions can be used to access the Firebase repo at other branches,\ntags, or commits.\n\n#### Background\n\nSee\n[the Podfile Syntax Reference](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#pod)\nfor instructions and options about overriding pod source locations.\n\n#### Accessing Firebase Source Snapshots\n\nAll of the official releases are tagged in this repo and available via CocoaPods. To access a local\nsource snapshot or unreleased branch, use Podfile directives like the following:\n\nTo access FirebaseFirestore via a branch:\n```\npod 'FirebaseCore', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :branch => 'master'\npod 'FirebaseFirestore', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :branch => 'master'\n```\n\nTo access FirebaseMessaging via a checked out version of the firebase-ios-sdk repo do:\n\n```\npod 'FirebaseCore', :path => '/path/to/firebase-ios-sdk'\npod 'FirebaseMessaging', :path => '/path/to/firebase-ios-sdk'\n```\n\n### Carthage (iOS only)\n\nInstructions for the experimental Carthage distribution are at\n[Carthage](Carthage.md).\n\n### Rome\n\nInstructions for installing binary frameworks via\n[Rome](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Rome) are at [Rome](Rome.md).\n\n## Development\n\nTo develop Firebase software in this repository, ensure that you have at least\nthe following software:\n\n  * Xcode 10.1 (or later)\n  * CocoaPods 1.7.2 (or later)\n  * [CocoaPods generate](https://github.com/square/cocoapods-generate)\n\nFor the pod that you want to develop:\n\n`pod gen Firebase{name here}.podspec --local-sources=./ --auto-open`\n\nNote: If the CocoaPods cache is out of date, you may need to run\n`pod repo update` before the `pod gen` command.\n\nFirestore has a self contained Xcode project. See\n[Firestore/README.md](Firestore/README.md).\n\n### Adding a New Firebase Pod\n\nSee [AddNewPod.md](AddNewPod.md).\n\n### Code Formatting\n\nTo ensure that the code is formatted consistently, run the script\n[./scripts/style.sh](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/master/scripts/style.sh)\nbefore creating a PR.\n\nTravis will verify that any code changes are done in a style compliant way. Install\n`clang-format` and `swiftformat`.\nThese commands will get the right versions:\n\n```\nbrew upgrade https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/e3496d9/Formula/clang-format.rb\nbrew upgrade https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/7963c3d/Formula/swiftformat.rb\n```\n\nNote: if you already have a newer version of these installed you may need to\n`brew switch` to this version.\n\nTo update this section, find the versions of clang-format and swiftformat.rb to\nmatch the versions in the CI failure logs\n[here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/tree/master/Formula).\n\n### Running Unit Tests\n\nSelect a scheme and press Command-u to build a component and run its unit tests.\n\n#### Viewing Code Coverage\n\nFirst, make sure that [xcov](https://github.com/nakiostudio/xcov) is installed with `gem install xcov`.\n\nAfter running the `AllUnitTests_iOS` scheme in Xcode, execute\n`xcov --workspace Firebase.xcworkspace --scheme AllUnitTests_iOS --output_directory xcov_output`\nat Example/ in the terminal. This will aggregate the coverage, and you can run `open xcov_output/index.html` to see the results.\n\n### Running Sample Apps\nIn order to run the sample apps and integration tests, you'll need valid\n`GoogleService-Info.plist` files for those samples. The Firebase Xcode project contains dummy plist\nfiles without real values, but can be replaced with real plist files. To get your own\n`GoogleService-Info.plist` files:\n\n1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)\n2. Create a new Firebase project, if you don't already have one\n3. For each sample app you want to test, create a new Firebase app with the sample app's bundle\nidentifier (e.g. `com.google.Database-Example`)\n4. Download the resulting `GoogleService-Info.plist` and replace the appropriate dummy plist file\n(e.g. in [Example/Database/App/](Example/Database/App/));\n\nSome sample apps like Firebase Messaging ([Example/Messaging/App](Example/Messaging/App)) require\nspecial Apple capabilities, and you will have to change the sample app to use a unique bundle\nidentifier that you can control in your own Apple Developer account.\n\n## Specific Component Instructions\nSee the sections below for any special instructions for those components.\n\n### Firebase Auth\n\nIf you're doing specific Firebase Auth development, see\n[the Auth Sample README](Example/Auth/README.md) for instructions about\nbuilding and running the FirebaseAuth pod along with various samples and tests.\n\n### Firebase Database\n\nTo run the Database Integration tests, make your database authentication rules\n[public](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/quickstart).\n\n### Firebase Storage\n\nTo run the Storage Integration tests, follow the instructions in\n[FIRStorageIntegrationTests.m](Example/Storage/Tests/Integration/FIRStorageIntegrationTests.m).\n\n#### Push Notifications\n\nPush notifications can only be delivered to specially provisioned App IDs in the developer portal.\nIn order to actually test receiving push notifications, you will need to:\n\n1. Change the bundle identifier of the sample app to something you own in your Apple Developer\naccount, and enable that App ID for push notifications.\n2. You'll also need to\n[upload your APNs Provider Authentication Key or certificate to the Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/certs)\nat **Project Settings > Cloud Messaging > [Your Firebase App]**.\n3. Ensure your iOS device is added to your Apple Developer portal as a test device.\n\n#### iOS Simulator\n\nThe iOS Simulator cannot register for remote notifications, and will not receive push notifications.\nIn order to receive push notifications, you'll have to follow the steps above and run the app on a\nphysical device.\n\n## Community Supported Efforts\n\nWe've seen an amazing amount of interest and contributions to improve the Firebase SDKs, and we are\nvery grateful!  We'd like to empower as many developers as we can to be able to use Firebase and\nparticipate in the Firebase community.\n\n### macOS and tvOS\nThanks to contributions from the community, FirebaseABTesting, FirebaseAuth, FirebaseCore,\nFirebaseDatabase, FirebaseMessaging, FirebaseFirestore,\nFirebaseFunctions, FirebaseRemoteConfig, and FirebaseStorage now compile, run unit tests, and work on\nmacOS and tvOS.\n\nFor tvOS, checkout the [Sample](Example/tvOSSample).\n\nKeep in mind that macOS and tvOS are not officially supported by Firebase, and this repository is\nactively developed primarily for iOS. While we can catch basic unit test issues with Travis, there\nmay be some changes where the SDK no longer works as expected on macOS or tvOS. If you encounter\nthis, please [file an issue](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/issues).\n\nTo install, add a subset of the following to the Podfile:\n\n```\npod 'FirebaseABTesting'\npod 'FirebaseAuth'\npod 'FirebaseCore'\npod 'FirebaseDatabase'\npod 'FirebaseFirestore'\npod 'FirebaseFunctions'\npod 'FirebaseMessaging'\npod 'FirebaseRemoteConfig'\npod 'FirebaseStorage'\n```\n\n## Roadmap\n\nSee [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for more about the Firebase iOS SDK Open Source\nplans and directions.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on contributing to the Firebase\niOS SDK.\n\n## License\n\nThe contents of this repository is licensed under the\n[Apache License, version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n\nYour use of Firebase is governed by the\n[Terms of Service for Firebase Services](https://firebase.google.com/terms/).\n"
