This SDK is distributed via:\n\n- [CDN](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup/#add-sdks-initialize)\n- [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase)\n- [Bower package](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-bower)\n\nTo get started using Firebase, see\n[Add Firebase to your JavaScript Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).\n\n[![Release Notes](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/firebase.svg?style=flat-square&label=Release%20Notes%20for&labelColor=039be5&color=666)](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/js)\n\n## Supported Environments\nPlease see [Environment Support](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/environments_js-sdk).\n\n## SDK Dev Workflow\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n#### Node.js\n\nBefore you can start working on the Firebase JS SDK, you need to have Node.js\ninstalled on your machine. The currently supported versions are `10.15.0` or greater.\n\nTo download Node.js visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/.\n\n_NOTE: You can use a tool like [`NVM`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)\nor [`N`](https://github.com/tj/n) to install and manage multiple node versions_\n\n#### Yarn\n\nIn addition to Node.js we use `yarn` to facilitate multi package development.\n\nTo install `yarn` follow the instructions listed on their website:\nhttps://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install\n\n#### Java\n\nThe closure compiler requires a modern Java installation. Java 8+ should be installed: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html\n\n#### Verify Prerequisites\n\nYou can verify your setup by running the following commands in your terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ node -v\n$ yarn -v\n$ java -version\n```\n\nYour Node.js version should be `10.15.0` or greater, your `yarn` version should\nbe `1.0.0` or greater, and your `java` version should be `1.8.0` or greater.\n\n_NOTE: We will update the documentation as new versions are required, however\nfor continuing development on the SDK, staying up to date on the stable versions\nof these packages is advised_\n\n### Install Dependencies\n\nOnce you have Node.js and `yarn` installed on your machine and have validated\nthat you are running the proper version, you can set up the development environment\nby running the following at the root of the SDK:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn\n```\n\nOnce you have installed all the dependencies, you can build the entire SDK by\nrunning the following command the root of the SDK:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn build\n```\n\n## Testing the SDK\n\n### Test Setup\n\nA production project is required to test the Firebase JS SDK. You can create a\nnew project by visiting the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).\n\n#### Firestore Support\n\nVisit the database section of the console and enable the Cloud Firestore Beta.\nYou can select either of the default permissions settings as we will overwrite\nthem below.\n\n#### Authentication Support\n\nVisit the authentication config in your project and enable the `Anonymous`\nsign-in provider to complete your project config.\n\n#### Automated Setup\n\nThe remainder of the test setup requires choosing a test project. You can \nchoose the project manually or specify the project directly at the root of \nthe package.\n\n```bash\n# Select a project manually when running setup\n$ yarn test:setup\n\n# Specify the specific project for setup\n$ yarn test:setup --projectId=<your-test-project>\n```\n\n### Running the tests\n\nEach of the directories in the `integration` directory as well as the `packages`\ndirectory have their own test suites. You will need to build the SDK before\nrunning tests. Test suites can be run all together by running the following \ncommand at the root of the package:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn test\n```\n\nIn addition, you can run any of the tests individually by running `yarn test` in\nan individual package directory.\n\n## Building the SDK\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Firebase JS SDK is built with a series of individual packages that are all\ncontained in this repository. Development is coordinated via [yarn\nworkspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/) and\n[Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) (a monorepo management tool).\n\nEach package in the `packages` directory, constitute a piece of our\nimplementation. The SDK is built via a combination of all of these packages\nwhich are published under the [`firebase`\nscope](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=scope%3Afirebase) on NPM.\n\n### Helper Scripts\n\nEach package in the `packages` directory exposes a `dev` script. This script\nwill set up a watcher for development on the individual piece of the SDK. In\naddition, there is a top level `dev` script that can be run to start all of the\nwatch tasks as well as a sandbox server.\n\nYou can run the dev script by running the following at the root of the package:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn dev\n```\n\n### Prepush Hooks\n\nAs part of this repo, we use the NPM package [`husky`](https://npm.im/husky) to\nimplement git hooks. We leverage the prepush hook to do two things:\n\n- Automated code styling (using [`prettier`](https://npm.im/prettier))\n- Automated LICENSE header insertion\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on contributing to the Firebase\nJavaScript SDK.\n\n### Big Thanks\n\nCross-browser Testing Platform and Open Source <3 Provided by [Sauce Labs][homepage]\n\n[homepage]: https://saucelabs.com\n'
