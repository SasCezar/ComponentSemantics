b"## Building Todoist from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & React Testing Library (http://bit.ly/CognitiveSurge)\n\nThis application (a Todoist clone) was built using create-react-app as a base, and the technologies used were React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & React Testing Library. I'm hoping this gives people a better understanding of React, and I've also included SCSS in this tutorial, but the main focus is to build a real application using React! If you clone this application, click the Pizza icon on the top right, it enables dark mode!\n\nSubscribe to my YouTube channel here: http://bit.ly/CognitiveSurge where I build projects like this! And don't forget, you can contribute to this project (highly encouraged!). One thing I didn't get time to do was incorporate accessibility into this application, so I'd love to see that added!\n\n![Preview](todoist-preview.png?raw=true)\n"
