[Setup Flutter](https://flutter.io/setup/)\n\n#### 2. Clone the repo\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/mdanics/fluttergram.git\n$ cd fluttergram/\n```\n\n#### 3. Setup the firebase app\n\n1. You\'ll need to create a Firebase instance. Follow the instructions at https://console.firebase.google.com.\n2. Once your Firebase instance is created, you\'ll need to enable anonymous authentication.\n\n* Go to the Firebase Console for your new instance.\n* Click "Authentication" in the left-hand menu\n* Click the "sign-in method" tab\n* Click "Google" and enable it\n\n3. Create Cloud Functions (to make the Feed work)\n* Create a new firebase project with `firebase init`\n* Copy this project\'s `functions/lib/index.js` to your firebase project\'s `functions/index.js`\n* Push the function `getFeed` with `firebase deploy --only functions`  In the output, you\'ll see the getFeed URL, copy that.\n* Replace the url in the `_getFeed` function in `feed.dart` with your cloud function url from the previous step.\n\n\n_**If this does not work**  and you get the error `Error: Error parsing triggers: Cannot find module \'./notificationHandler\'` Try following [these steps](https://github.com/mdanics/fluttergram/issues/25#issuecomment-434031430). If you are still unable to get it to work please open a new issue._\n\n_**If you are getting no errors, but an empty feed** You must follow users with posts as the getFeed function only returns posts from people you follow._\n\n\n\n4. Enable the Firebase Database\n* Go to the Firebase Console\n* Click "Database" in the left-hand menu\n* Click the Cloudstore "Create Database" button\n* Select "Start in test mode" and "Enable"\n\n5. (skip if not running on Android)\n\n* Create an app within your Firebase instance for Android, with package name com.yourcompany.news\n* Run the following command to get your SHA-1 key:\n\n```\nkeytool -exportcert -list -v \\\n-alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore\n```\n\n* In the Firebase console, in the settings of your Android app, add your SHA-1 key by clicking "Add Fingerprint".\n* Follow instructions to download google-services.json\n* place `google-services.json` into `/android/app/`.\n\n\n6. (skip if not running on iOS)\n\n* Create an app within your Firebase instance for iOS, with your app package name\n* Follow instructions to download GoogleService-Info.plist\n* Open XCode, right click the Runner folder, select the "Add Files to \'Runner\'" menu, and select the GoogleService-Info.plist file to add it to /ios/Runner in XCode\n* Open /ios/Runner/Info.plist in a text editor. Locate the CFBundleURLSchemes key. The second item in the array value of this key is specific to the Firebase instance. Replace it with the value for REVERSED_CLIENT_ID from GoogleService-Info.plist\n\nDouble check install instructions for both\n   - Google Auth Plugin\n     - https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase_auth\n   - Firestore Plugin\n     -  https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/cloud_firestore\n\n# What\'s Next?\n - [x] Notificaitons for likes, comments, follows, etc\n - [ ] Improve Caching of Profiles, Images, Etc.\n - [ ] Better post creation, add filters to your image\n - [ ] Custom Camera Implementation\n - [ ] Animations (heart when liking image)\n - [ ] Firebase Security Rules\n - [ ] Delete Posts\n - [ ] Registration without Google SignIn\n - [ ] Direct Messaging\n - [ ] Stories\n - [ ] Clean up code\n'
