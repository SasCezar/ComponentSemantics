The examples in this repo are mostly in Java and Typescript, but there\'s support for many other languages:\n* gRPC and Protocol Buffers are supported by Google in C++, Java (and Android Java), Python, Go, C#, Objective-C, PHP, Dart, Ruby and JavaScript (incl. Node.js).\n* Bazel is supported by Google in Java (incl. Android builds), Objective-C (incl. iOS builds), C++, Go, Dart, Rust, Sass and Scala.\n* The community has added support for many others languages. See [this list](https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/docs/third_party.md) for Protocol Buffers and gRPC, and [this one](https://github.com/jin/awesome-bazel#rules) for Bazel.\n\n## Top examples\n* Lots of [Protocol Buffer examples](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=repo%3Agoogle%2Fstartup-os+extension%3Aproto&type=Code&ref=advsearch&l=&l=).\n* [gRPC-Web](https://github.com/oferb/startup-os-example/tree/master/app): a js client library running in the browser, connected to a gRPC server through an HTTP proxy. Both server and client use gRPC auto-generated stubs to handle communication.\n* gRPC [microservices example](https://github.com/google/startup-os/blob/master/tools/reviewer/local_server/LocalServer.java).\n* [Docker example](https://github.com/google/startup-os/tree/master/examples/docker): building containers using Bazel (no dockerfile needed!).\n* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/google/startup-os/tree/master/examples/k8s): a config file showing how to run a container built with Bazel on k8s.\n* [CI example](https://github.com/google/startup-os/tree/master/.circleci): Using CircleCI to run CI (continuous integration) and test all Bazel targets.\n* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com): Java client for storing Protocol Buffers [here](https://github.com/google/startup-os/blob/master/common/firestore/FirestoreProtoClient.java).\n* [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger): Java Dependency Injection framework  ("Next gen Guice"), see examples [here](https://github.com/google/startup-os/tree/master/examples/dagger).\n* [Flogger](https://github.com/google/flogger): Java logger with fluent API, see examples [here](https://github.com/google/startup-os/search?q=com.google.common.flogger.FluentLogger&unscoped_q=com.google.common.flogger.FluentLogger).\n* [Android app](https://github.com/google/startup-os/tree/master/examples/android): An Android app built with Bazel and integrated to Firebase.\n\n## Tools\nThere are several useful tools in the [tools section](https://github.com/google/startup-os/tree/master/tools).\n\n## How to use StartupOS\nYou can treat StartupOS as a "developer image" with a pre-built setup and associated tools.\n\nYou can either:\n* Clone this repo and evolve it on your own.\n* Treat it as a dependency to your own repo. An example for that is here: https://github.com/oferb/startup-os-example\n\n## Installation\nInstall [Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html). That\'s it!\n\n## Build & Test\n* Build everything: `./build.sh`\n* Run all tests: `./test.sh`\n\n## About monorepos\nA monorepo is a software development approach where all code is stored in a single repository. Some things are easier to do in a monorepo, such as sharing a proto file across front-end and backend, some things are harder, such as per-repo control over collaborators, email notifications, commit history etc.\nWe\'re working on an approach where multiple repos can act as a single monorepo, while still being separate repos, using multi-repo tooling such as [multi-repo code review](tools/reviewer).\n\nSome good reads about the monorepo approach:\n* [trunkbaseddevelopment.com/monorepos](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/monorepos/)\n* [Why Google stores billions of lines of code in a single repository](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext)\n\n## Platforms\nWhile Bazel supports Linux, Mac and Windows, this repo supports Linux and Mac.\nIf you\'re on Windows 10, you can use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/wsl/about).\nIt gives you a Linux environment, without the overhead of a virtual machine.\n\n#### Installing Windows Subsystem for Linux:\nPlease follow the [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/wsl/install-win10).\nNote: You may have to do a Windows upgrade. If you need it, it will ask for it at the beginning of the installation.\n\n## Contributing\nYou\'re welcome to contribute and in doing so, learn these technologies.\nYou can have a look at the issues list, or at the project [milestones](docs/milestones.md).\n'
