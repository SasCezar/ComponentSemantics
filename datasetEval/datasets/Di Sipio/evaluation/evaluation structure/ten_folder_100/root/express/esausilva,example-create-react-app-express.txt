b'# create-react-app React Project with Node Express Backend\r\n\r\n> Example on using create-react-app with a Node Express Backend\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nInstall [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) globally\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm i nodemon -g\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall server and client dependencies\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn\r\ncd client\r\nyarn\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo start the server and client at the same time (from the root of the project)\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the production build on localhost. This will create a production build, then Node will serve the app on http://localhost:5000\r\n\r\n```\r\nNODE_ENV=production yarn dev:server\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How this works\r\n\r\nThe key to use an Express backend with a project created with `create-react-app` is on using a **proxy**. We have a _proxy_ entry in `client/package.json`\r\n\r\n```\r\n"proxy": "http://localhost:5000/"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis tells Webpack development server to proxy our API requests to our API server, given that our Express server is running on **localhost:5000**\r\n\r\n## Tutorial\r\n\r\nVisit my [blog post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-create-react-app-work-with-a-node-backend-api-7c5c48acb1b0) entry for a detailed step-by-step guide.\r\n\r\n[Deployed app](https://cra-express.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\n## Giving Back\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support my work and the time I put in making tutorials, you can click the image below to get me a coffee.
