Thanks for the contributions of fython and his team.\n\n### Features\n\n+ Over than 640 express companies all over the world are supported.\n+ Support add packages by inputting the package number manually or just scanning the express sheet.\n+ Support recognize the company of a package automatically.\n+ Support view the package\'s details such as the latest location.\n+ Support search packages that you added and the information about the express companies.\n+ Launcher widgets are provided.\n+ Day mode and night mode are supported.\n+ Support push notification when the package is refreshed.\n+ Support send feedback on using experience from your devices.\n\n### Screenshots\n![screenshot0](./art/screenshot0.png)\n\n![screenshot1](./art/screenshot1.png)\n\n### How to Work with the Source\nI hope the source code for this app is useful for you as a reference or starting point for creating your own app. Here is some instructions to help you better build and run the code in Android Studio.\n\nClone the Repository:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/TonnyL/Espresso.git\n```\n\nCheck out the master branch:\n\n```\ngit checkout master\n```\n\nNotice: If you want to review a different branch, replace the `master` with the name you want to checkout (if it does exist). Finally open the `Espresso/` directory in Android Studio.\n\nSuggestion: It is better for you to update your Android Studio to version 2.3 when you open this project.\n\n### To-dos\nThis project is still in progress. Here are the some features that I will finish in the future.\n\n- [x] Refreshing package details by accessing the network.\n- [x] Launcher app widgets.\n- [x] App Shortcuts on devices that running Android 7.1+.\n- [x] Material design app onboard pages.\n- [x] Chrome Custom Tabs.\n- [x] Alphabet indexing for companies list.\n- [x] Search packages and companies.\n- [x] Day and night mode.\n- [x] Service to build notifications.\n- [x] Settings and about page.\n- [ ] UI test and unit test.\n\n### Help Me Improve This App\n+ As you can see at the screenshots, some images in Espresso app are not suitable.
