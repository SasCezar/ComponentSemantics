The Golden Rule: Design for lean testing\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** \nTesting code is not like production-code - design it to be dead-simple, short, abstraction-free, flat, delightful to work with, lean. One should look at a test and get the intent instantly. \n\nOur minds are full with the main production code, we don\'t have \'headspace\' for additional complexity. Should we try to squeeze yet another challenging code into our poor brain it will slow the team down which works against the reason we do testing. Practically this is where many teams just abandon testing.\n \nThe tests are an opportunity for something else - a friendly and smiley assistant, one that it\'s delightful to work with and delivers great value for such a  small investment.  Science tells us that we have two brain systems: system 1 is used for effortless activities like driving a car on an empty road and system 2 which is meant for complex and conscious operations like solving a math equation. Design your test for system 1, when looking at test code it should *feel* as easy as modifying an HTML document and not like solving 2X(17 \xc3\x97 24).\n\nThis can be achieved by selectively cherry-picking techniques, tools and test targets that are cost-effective and provide great ROI. Test only as much as needed, strive to keep it nimble, sometimes it\'s even worth dropping some tests and trade reliability for agility and simplicity.\n\n![alt text](/assets/headspace.png "We have no head room for additional complexity")\n \nMost of the advice below are derivatives of this principle.\n\n### Ready to start?\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n# Section 1: The Test Anatomy\n\n<br/>\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f 1.1 Include 3 parts in each test name\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** A test report should tell whether the current application revision satisfies the requirements for the people who are not necessarily familiar with the code: the tester, the DevOps engineer who is deploying and the future you two years from now. This can be achieved best if the tests speak at the requirements level and include 3 parts:\n\n(1) What is being tested? For example, the ProductsService.addNewProduct method\n\n(2) Under what circumstances and scenario? For example, no price is passed to the method\n\n(3) What is the expected result? For example, the new product is not approved\n\n<br/>\n\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** A deployment just failed, a test named \xe2\x80\x9cAdd product\xe2\x80\x9d failed. Does this tell you what exactly is malfunctioning?\n\n<br/>\n\n**\xf0\x9f\x91\x87 Note:** Each bullet has code examples and sometime also an image illustration.

Following this structure guarantees that the reader spends no brain-CPU on understanding the test plan:\n\n1st A - Arrange: All the setup code to bring the system to the scenario the test aims to simulate. This might include instantiating the unit under test constructor, adding DB records, mocking/stubbing on objects and any other preparation code\n\n2nd A - Act: Execute the unit under test. Usually 1 line of code\n\n3rd A - Assert: Ensure that the received value satisfies the expectation. Usually 1 line of code\n\n\n<br/>\n\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** Not only do you spend hours understanding the main code, but what should have been the simplest part of the day (testing) stretches your brain\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: A test structured with the AAA pattern\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7%20Example%20using%20Jest-blue.svg\n "Examples with Jest") ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7%20Example%20using%20Mocha-blue.svg\n "Examples with Jest")\n  \n```javascript\ndescribe(\'Customer classifier\', () => {\n    test(\'When customer spent more than 500$, should be classified as premium\', () => {\n        //Arrange\n        const customerToClassify = {spent:505, joined: new Date(), id:1}\n        const DBStub = sinon.stub(dataAccess, "getCustomer")\n            .reply({id:1, classification: \'regular\'});\n\n        //Act\n        const receivedClassification = customerClassifier.classifyCustomer(customerToClassify);\n\n        //Assert\n        expect(receivedClassification).toMatch(\'premium\');\n    });\n});\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: No separation, one bulk, harder to interpret\n\n```javascript\ntest(\'Should be classified as premium\', () => {\n        const customerToClassify = {spent:505, joined: new Date(), id:1}\n        const DBStub = sinon.stub(dataAccess, "getCustomer")\n            .reply({id:1, classification: \'regular\'});\n        const receivedClassification = customerClassifier.classifyCustomer(customerToClassify);\n        expect(receivedClassification).toMatch(\'premium\');\n    });\n```\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f1.3 Describe expectations in a product language: use BDD-style assertions\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Coding your tests in a declarative-style allows the reader to get the grab instantly without spending even a single brain-CPU cycle. When you write imperative code that is packed with conditional logic, the reader is forced to exert more brain-CPU cycles. In that case, code the expectation in a human-like language, declarative BDD style using `expect` or `should` and not using custom code. If Chai & Jest doesn\'t include the desired assertion and it\xe2\x80\x99s highly repeatable, consider [extending Jest matcher (Jest)](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#expectextendmatchers) or writing a [custom Chai plugin](https://www.chaijs.com/guide/plugins/)\n<br/>\n\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** The team will write less tests and decorate the annoying ones with .skip()\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary><br/>\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7%20Example%20using%20Mocha-blue.svg\n "Examples with Mocha & Chai") ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7%20Example%20using%20Jest-blue.svg\n "Examples with Jest")\n  \n  ### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: The reader must skim through not so short, and imperative code just to get the test story\n\n```javascript\ntest("When asking for an admin, ensure only ordered admins in results" , () => {\n    //assuming we\'ve added here two admins "admin1", "admin2" and "user1"\n    const allAdmins = getUsers({adminOnly:true});\n\n    const admin1Found, adming2Found = false;\n\n    allAdmins.forEach(aSingleUser => {\n        if(aSingleUser === "user1"){\n            assert.notEqual(aSingleUser, "user1", "A user was found and not admin");\n        }\n        if(aSingleUser==="admin1"){\n            admin1Found = true;\n        }\n        if(aSingleUser==="admin2"){\n            admin2Found = true;\n        }\n    });\n\n    if(!admin1Found || !admin2Found ){\n        throw new Error("Not all admins were returned");\n    }\n});\n\n```\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Skimming through the following declarative test is a breeze\n\n\n```javascript\nit("When asking for an admin, ensure only ordered admins in results" , () => {\n    //assuming we\'ve added here two admins\n    const allAdmins = getUsers({adminOnly:true});\n\n    expect(allAdmins).to.include.ordered.members(["admin1" , "admin2"])\n  .but.not.include.ordered.members(["user1"]);\n});\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f  1.4 Stick to black-box testing: Test only public methods\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Testing the internals brings huge overhead for almost nothing. If your code/API deliver the right results, should you really invest your next 3 hours in testing HOW it worked internally and then maintain these fragile tests? Whenever a public behavior is checked, the private implementation is also implicitly tested and your tests will break only if there is a certain problem (e.g. wrong output). This approach is also referred to as `behavioral testing`. On the other side, should you test the internals (white box approach)\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8ayour focus shifts from planning the component outcome to nitty-gritty details and your test might break because of minor code refactors although the results are fine - this dramatically increases the maintenance burden\n<br/>\n\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** Your tests behave like the [boy who cried wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf): shouting false-positive cries (e.g., A test fails because a private variable name was changed). Unsurprisingly, people will soon start to ignore the CI notifications until someday, a real bug gets ignored\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n<br/>\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: A test case is testing the internals for no good reason\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7%20Example%20using%20Mocha-blue.svg\n "Examples with Mocha & Chai")\n```javascript\nclass ProductService{\n  //this method is only used internally\n  //Change this name will make the tests fail\n  calculateVATAdd(priceWithoutVAT){\n    return {finalPrice: priceWithoutVAT * 1.2};\n    //Change the result format or key name above will make the tests fail\n  }\n  //public method\n  getPrice(productId){\n    const desiredProduct= DB.getProduct(productId);\n    finalPrice = this.calculateVATAdd(desiredProduct.price).finalPrice;\n    return finalPrice;\n  }\n}\n\n\nit("White-box test: When the internal methods get 0 vat, it return 0 response", async () => {\n    //There\'s no requirement to allow users to calculate the VAT, only show the final price.

If no, it\xe2\x80\x99s a white-box testing smell.\n\nFor example, if you want to test that your app behaves reasonably when the payment service is down, you might stub the payment service and trigger some \xe2\x80\x98No Response\xe2\x80\x99 return to ensure that the unit under test returns the right value. This checks our application behavior/response/outcome under certain scenarios. You might also use a spy to assert that an email was sent when that service is down\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8athis is again a behavioral check which is likely to appear in a requirements doc (\xe2\x80\x9cSend an email if payment couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be saved\xe2\x80\x9d). On the flip side, if you mock the Payment service and ensure that it was called with the right JavaScript types\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8athen your test is focused on internal things that got nothing with the application functionality and are likely to change frequently\n<br/>\n\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** Any refactoring of code mandates searching for all the mocks in the code and updating accordingly. Tests become a burden rather than a helpful friend\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti-pattern example: Mocks focus on the internals\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7%20Example%20using%20Sinon-blue.svg\n "Examples with Mocha & Chai")\n```javascript\nit("When a valid product is about to be deleted, ensure data access DAL was called once, with the right product and right config", async () => {\n    //Assume we already added a product\n    const dataAccessMock = sinon.mock(DAL);\n    //hmmm BAD: testing the internals is actually our main goal here, not just a side-effect\n    dataAccessMock.expects("deleteProduct").once().withArgs(DBConfig, theProductWeJustAdded, true, false);\n    new ProductService().deletePrice(theProductWeJustAdded);\n    dataAccessMock.verify();\n});\n```\n<br/>\n\n### :clap:Doing It Right Example: spies are focused on testing the requirements but as a side-effect are unavoidably touching to the internals\n\n```javascript\nit("When a valid product is about to be deleted, ensure an email is sent", async () => {\n    //Assume we already added here a product\n    const spy = sinon.spy(Emailer.prototype, "sendEmail");\n    new ProductService().deletePrice(theProductWeJustAdded);\n    //hmmm OK: we deal with internals? Yes, but as a side effect of testing the requirements (sending an email)\n    expect(spy.calledOnce).to.be.true;\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f1.6 Don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cfoo\xe2\x80\x9d, use realistic input data\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:**  Often production bugs are revealed under some very specific and surprising input\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8athe more realistic the test input is, the greater the chances are to catch bugs early. Use dedicated libraries like [Faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) to generate pseudo-real data that resembles the variety and form of production data. For example, such libraries can generate realistic phone numbers, usernames, credit card, company names, and even \xe2\x80\x98lorem ipsum\xe2\x80\x99 text. You may also create some tests (on top of unit tests, not as a replacement) that randomize fakers data to stretch your unit under test or even import real data from your production environment. Want to take it to the next level? See the next bullet (property-based testing).\n<br/>\n\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** All your development testing will falsely show green when you use synthetic inputs like \xe2\x80\x9cFoo\xe2\x80\x9d, but then production might turn red when a hacker passes-in a nasty string like \xe2\x80\x9c@3e2ddsf . ##\xe2\x80\x99 1 fdsfds . fds432 AAAA\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: A test suite that passes due to non-realistic data\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7%20Example%20using%20Jest-blue.svg\n "Examples with Jest")\n \n \n```javascript\nconst addProduct = (name, price) =>{\n  const productNameRegexNoSpace = /^\\S*$/; //no white-space allowed\n\n  if(!productNameRegexNoSpace.test(name))\n    return false;//this path never reached due to dull input\n\n    //some logic here\n    return true;\n};\n\ntest("Wrong: When adding new product with valid properties, get successful confirmation", async () => {\n    //The string "Foo" which is used in all tests never triggers a false result\n    const addProductResult = addProduct("Foo", 5);\n    expect(addProductResult).toBe(true);\n    //Positive-false: the operation succeeded because we never tried with long\n    //product name including spaces\n});\n\n```\n<br/>\n\n### :clap:Doing It Right Example: Randomizing realistic input\n```javascript\nit("Better: When adding new valid product, get successful confirmation", async () => {\n    const addProductResult = addProduct(faker.commerce.productName(), faker.random.number());\n    //Generated random input: {\'Sleek Cotton Computer\',  85481}\n    expect(addProductResult).to.be.true;\n    //Test failed, the random input triggered some path we never planned for.\n    //We discovered a bug early!\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f 1.7 Test many input combinations using Property-based testing\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Typically we choose a few input samples for each test. Even when the input format resembles real-world data (see bullet \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t foo\xe2\x80\x99), we cover only a few input combinations (method(\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99, true, 1), method(\xe2\x80\x9cstring\xe2\x80\x9d , false\xe2\x80\x9d , 0)), However, in production, an API that is called with 5 parameters can be invoked with thousands of different permutations, one of them might render our process down ([see Fuzz Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)). What if you could write a single test that sends 1000 permutations of different inputs automatically and catches for which input our code fails to return the right response? Property-based testing is a technique that does exactly that: by sending all the possible input combinations to your unit under test it increases the serendipity of finding a bug. For example, given a method\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aaddNewProduct(id, name, isDiscount)\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8athe supporting libraries will call this method with many combinations of (number, string, boolean) like (1, \xe2\x80\x9ciPhone\xe2\x80\x9d, false), (2, \xe2\x80\x9cGalaxy\xe2\x80\x9d, true). You can run property-based testing using your favorite test runner (Mocha, Jest, etc) using libraries like [js-verify](https://github.com/jsverify/jsverify) or [testcheck](https://github.com/leebyron/testcheck-js) (much better documentation). Update: Nicolas Dubien suggests in the comments below to [checkout fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check#readme) which seems to offer some additional features and also to be actively maintained\n<br/>\n\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** Unconsciously, you choose the test inputs that cover only code paths that work well. Unfortunately, this decreases the efficiency of testing as a vehicle to expose bugs\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap:  Doing It Right Example: Testing many input permutations with \xe2\x80\x9cmocha-testcheck\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7%20Example%20using%20Mocha-blue.svg\n "Examples with Jest")\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\'mocha-testcheck\').install();\nconst {expect} = require(\'chai\');\n\ndescribe(\'Product service\', () => {\n  describe(\'Adding new\', () => {\n    //this will run 100 times with different random properties\n    check.it(\'Add new product with random yet valid properties, always successful\',\n      gen.int, gen.string, (id, name) => {\n        expect(addNewProduct(id, name).status).to.equal(\'approved\');\n      });\n  })\n});\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f 1.8 If needed, use only short & inline snapshots\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** When there is a need for [snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing), use only short and focused snapshots (i.e. 3-7 lines) that are included as part of the test ([Inline Snapshot](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing#inline-snapshots)) and not within external files. Keeping this guideline will ensure your tests remain self-explanatory and less fragile.\n\nOn the other hand, \xe2\x80\x98classic snapshots\xe2\x80\x99 tutorials and tools encourage to store big files (e.g. component rendering markup, API JSON result) over some external medium and ensure each time when the test run to compare the received result with the saved version. This, for example, can implicitly couple our test to 1000 lines with 3000 data values that the test writer never read and reasoned about. Why is this wrong? By doing so, there are 1000 reasons for your test to fail - it\xe2\x80\x99s enough for a single line to change for the snapshot to get invalid and this is likely to happen a lot. How frequently? for every space, comment or minor CSS/HTML change.

For example, consider an IOT application that ingests many events into a message-bus like Kafka/RabbitMQ, which then flow into some data-warehouse and are eventually queried by some analytics UI. Should we really spend 50% of our testing budget on writing unit tests for an application that is integration-centric and has almost no logic?

Separate UI from functionality\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** When focusing on testing component logic, UI details become a noise that should be extracted, so your tests can focus on pure data. Practically, extract the desired data from the markup in an abstract way that is not too coupled to the graphic implementation, assert only on pure data (vs HTML/CSS graphic details) and disable animations that slow down. You might get tempted to avoid rendering and test only the back part of the UI (e.g. services, actions, store) but this will result in fictional tests that don\'t resemble the reality and won\'t reveal cases where the right data doesn\'t even arrive in the UI\n\n\n<br/>\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** The pure calculated data of your test might be ready in 10ms, but then the whole test will last 500ms (100 tests = 1 min) due to some fancy and irrelevant animation\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Separating out the UI details\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7%20Example%20using%20React-blue.svg\n "Examples with React") ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7%20Example%20using%20React%20Testing%20Library-blue.svg\n "Examples with react-testing-library")\n\n```javascript\ntest(\'When users-list is flagged to show only VIP, should display only VIP members\', () => {\n  // Arrange\n  const allUsers = [\n   { id: 1, name: \'Yoni Goldberg\', vip: false }, \n   { id: 2, name: \'John Doe\', vip: true }\n  ];\n\n  // Act\n  const { getAllByTestId } = render(<UsersList users={allUsers} showOnlyVIP={true}/>);\n\n  // Assert - Extract the data from the UI first\n  const allRenderedUsers = getAllByTestId(\'user\').map(uiElement => uiElement.textContent);\n  const allRealVIPUsers = allUsers.filter((user) => user.vip).map((user) => user.name);\n  expect(allRenderedUsers).toEqual(allRealVIPUsers); //compare data with data, no UI here\n});\n\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: Assertion mix UI details and data\n```javascript\ntest(\'When flagging to show only VIP, should display only VIP members\', () => {\n  // Arrange\n  const allUsers = [\n   {id: 1, name: \'Yoni Goldberg\', vip: false }, \n   {id: 2, name: \'John Doe\', vip: true }\n  ];\n\n  // Act\n  const { getAllByTestId } = render(<UsersList users={allUsers} showOnlyVIP={true}/>);\n\n  // Assert - Mix UI & data in assertion\n  expect(getAllByTestId(\'user\')).toEqual(\'[<li data-testid="user">John Doe</li>]\');\n});\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f 3.2 Query HTML elements based on attributes that are unlikely to change\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Query HTML elements based on attributes that are likely to survive graphic changes unlike CSS selectors and like form labels.

Avoid all sort of mocking, partial and shallow rendering - this approach might result in untrapped bugs due to lack of details and harden the maintenance as the tests mess with the internals (see bullet \'Favour blackbox testing\'). If one of the child components is significantly slowing down (e.g. animation) or complicating the setup - consider explicitly replacing it with a fake\n\nWith all that said, a word of caution is in order: this technique works for small/medium components that pack a reasonable size of child components. Fully rendering a component with too many children will make it hard to reason about test failures (root cause analysis) and might get too slow. In such cases, write only a few tests against that fat parent component and more tests against its children\n\n<br/>\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** When poking into a component\'s internal by invoking its private methods, and checking the inner state - you would have to refactor all tests when refactoring the components implementation.

Also try to speed things up\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** In many cases, the unit under test completion time is just unknown (e.g. animation suspends element appearance) - in that case, avoid sleeping (e.g. setTimeOut) and prefer more deterministic methods that most platforms provide. Some libraries allows awaiting on operations (e.g. [Cypress cy.request(\'url\')](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html#Unnecessary-Waiting)), other provide API for waiting like [@testing-library/dom method wait(expect(element))](https://testing-library.com/docs/guide-disappearance). Sometimes a more elegant way is to stub the slow resource, like API for example, and then once the response moment becomes deterministic the component can be explicitly re-rendered. When depending upon some external component that sleeps, it might turn useful to [hurry-up the clock](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/timer-mocks). Sleeping is a pattern to avoid because it forces your test to be slow or risky (when waiting for a too short period). Whenever sleeping and polling is inevitable and there\'s no support from the testing framework, some npm libraries like [wait-for-expect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-for-expect) can help with a semi-deterministic solution \n<br/>\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** When sleeping for a long time, tests will be an order of magnitude slower. When trying to sleep for small numbers, test will fail when the unit under test didn\'t respond in a timely fashion.

The inspection tools market is no short: basic tools like [pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/), AWS CloudWatch, [gcp StackDriver](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime-checks/) can be easily configured to watch whether the server is alive and response under a reasonable SLA. This only scratches the surface of what might get wrong, hence it\'s preferable to opt for tools that specialize in frontend (e.g. [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), [pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)) and perform richer analysis. The focus should be on symptoms, metrics that directly affect the UX, like page load time, [meaningful paint](https://scotch.io/courses/10-web-performance-audit-tips-for-your-next-billion-users-in-2018/fmp-first-meaningful-paint), [time until the page gets interactive (TTI)](https://calibreapp.com/blog/time-to-interactive/). On top of that, one may also watch for technical causes like ensuring the content is compressed, time to the first byte, optimize images, ensuring reasonable DOM size, SSL and many others.

Practically, instead of real network calls to APIs, use some test double library (like [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/), [Test doubles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testdouble), etc) for stubbing the API response. The main benefit is preventing flakiness - testing or staging APIs by definition are not highly stable and from time to time will fail your tests although YOUR component behaves just fine (production env was not meant for testing and it usually throttles requests). Doing this will allow simulating various API behavior that should drive your component behavior as when no data was found or the case when API throws an error. Last but not least, network calls will greatly slow down the tests\n\n<br/>\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** The average test runs no longer than few ms, a typical API call last 100ms>, this makes each test ~20x slower\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Stubbing or intercepting API calls\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7%20Example%20using%20React-blue.svg\n "Examples with React") ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa7%20Example%20using%20Jest-blue.svg\n "Examples with react-testing-library")\n \n```javascript\n\n// unit under test\nexport default function ProductsList() { \n    const [products, setProducts] = useState(false)\n\n    const fetchProducts = async() => {\n      const products = await axios.get(\'api/products\')\n      setProducts(products);\n    }\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n      fetchProducts();\n    }, []);\n\n  return products ? <div>{products}</div> : <div data-testid=\'no-products-message\'>No products</div>\n}\n\n// test\ntest(\'When no products exist, show the appropriate message\', () => {\n    // Arrange\n    nock("api")\n            .get(`/products`)\n            .reply(404);\n\n    // Act\n    const {getByTestId} = render(<ProductsList/>);\n\n    // Assert\n    expect(getByTestId(\'no-products-message\')).toBeTruthy();\n});\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f 3.7 Have very few end-to-end tests that spans the whole system\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Although E2E (end-to-end) usually means UI-only testing with a real browser (See bullet 3.6), for other they mean tests that stretch the entire system including the real backend. The latter type of tests is highly valuable as they cover integration bugs between frontend and backend that might happen due to a wrong understanding of the exchange schema. They are also an efficient method to discover backend-to-backend integration issues (e.g. Microservice A sends the wrong message to Microservice B) and even to detect deployment failures - there are no backend frameworks for E2E testing that are as friendly and mature as UI frameworks like [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [Pupeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer). The downside of such tests is the high cost of configuring an environment with so many components, and mostly their brittleness - given 50 microservices, even if one fails then the entire E2E just failed. For that reason, we should use this technique sparingly and probably have 1-10 of those and no more. That said, even a small number of E2E tests are likely to catch the type of issues they are targeted for - deployment & integration faults. It\'s advisable to run those over a production-like staging environment\n\n<br/>\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** UI might invest much in testing its functionality only to realizes very late that the backend returned payload (the data schema the UI has to work with) is very different than expected\n\n<br/>\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f 3.8 Speed-up E2E tests by reusing login credentials\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** In E2E tests that involve a real backend and rely on a valid user token for API calls, it doesn\'t payoff to isolate the test to a level where a user is created and logged-in in every request. Instead, login only once before the tests execution start (i.e. before-all hook), save the token in some local storage and reuse it across requests. This seem to violate one of the core testing principle - keep the test autonomous without resources coupling. While this is a valid worry, in E2E tests performance is a key concern and creating 1-3 API requests before starting each individial tests might lead to horrible execution time. Reusing credentials doesn\'t mean the tests have to act on the same user records - if relying on user records (e.g. test user payments history) than make sure to generate those records as part of the test and avoid sharing their existence with other tests. Also remember that the backend can be faked - if your tests are focused on the frontend it might be better to isolate it and stub the backend API (see bullet 3.6). \n\n<br/>\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** Given 200 test cases and assuming login=100ms = 20 seconds only for logging-in again and again\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Logging-in before-all and not before-each\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa8%20Example%20using%20Cypress-blue.svg\n "Using Cypress to illustrate the idea")\n\n```javascript\nlet authenticationToken;\n\n// happens before ALL tests run\nbefore(() => {\n  cy.request(\'POST\', \'http://localhost:3000/login\', {\n    username: Cypress.env(\'username\'),\n    password: Cypress.env(\'password\'),\n  })\n  .its(\'body\')\n  .then((responseFromLogin) => {\n    authenticationToken = responseFromLogin.token;\n  })\n})\n\n// happens before EACH test\nbeforeEach(setUser => () {\n  cy.visit(\'/home\', {\n    onBeforeLoad (win) {\n      win.localStorage.setItem(\'token\', JSON.stringify(authenticationToken))\n    },\n  })\n})\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n<br/>\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f 3.9 Have one E2E smoke test that just travels across the site map\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** For production monitoring and development-time sanity check, run a single E2E test that visits all/most of the site pages and ensures no one breaks. This type of test brings a great return on investment as it\'s very easy to write and maintain, but it can detect any kind of failure including functional, network and deployment issues. Other styles of smoke and sanity checking are not as reliable and exhaustive - some ops teams just ping the home page (production) or developers who run many integration tests which don\'t discover packaging and browser issues.

Since tests inherently speak at a less-technical and product/UX language, using the right tools they can serve as a communication artifact that greatly aligns all the peers - developers and their customers. For example, some frameworks allow expressing the flow and expectations (i.e. tests plan) using a human-readable language so any stakeholder, including product managers, can read, approve and collaborate on the tests which just became the live requirements document. This technique is also being referred to as \'acceptance test\' as it allows the customer to define his acceptance criteria in plain language. This is [BDD (behavior-driven testing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) at its purest form. One of the popular frameworks that enable this is [Cucumber which has a JavaScript flavor](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js), see example below. Another similar yet different opportunity, [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/), allows exposing UI components as a graphic catalog where one can walk through the various states of each component (e.g. render a grid w/o filters, render that grid with multiple rows or with none, etc), see how it looks like, and how to trigger that state - this can appeal also to product folks but mostly serves as live doc for developers who consume those components.\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** After investing top resources on testing, it\'s just a pity not to leverage this investment and win great value\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Describing tests in human-language using cucumber-js\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa8%20Example%20using%20Cucumber-blue.svg  "Examples using Cucumber")\n```javascript\n// this is how one can describe tests using cucumber: plain language that allows anyone to understand and collaborate\n\nFeature: Twitter new tweet\n \n  I want to tweet something in Twitter\n  \n  @focus\n  Scenario: Tweeting from the home page\n    Given I open Twitter home\n    Given I click on "New tweet" button\n    Given I type "Hello followers!" in the textbox \n    Given I click on "Submit" button\n    Then I see message "Tweet saved"\n    \n```\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Visualizing our components, their various states and inputs using Storybook\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa8%20Example%20using%20StoryBook-blue.svg "Using StoryBook")\n\n![alt text](assets/story-book.jpg "Storybook")\n\n\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f 3.11 Detect visual issues with automated tools\n\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Setup automated tools to capture UI screenshots when changes are presented and detect visual issues like content overlapping or breaking. This ensures that not only the right data is prepared but also the user can conveniently see it. This technique is not widely adopted, our testing mindset leans toward functional tests but it\'s the visuals what the user experience and with so many device types it\'s very easy to overlook some nasty UI bug. Some free tools can provide the basics - generate and save screenshots for the inspection of human eyes. While this approach might be sufficient for small apps, it\'s flawed as any other manual testing that demands human labor anytime something changes. On the other hand, it\'s quite challenging to detect UI issues automatically due to the lack of clear definition - this is where the field of \'Visual Regression\' chime in and solve this puzzle by comparing old UI with the latest changes and detect differences. Some OSS/free tools can provide some of this functionality (e.g. [wraith](https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith), [PhantomCSS]([https://github.com/HuddleEng/PhantomCSS](https://github.com/HuddleEng/PhantomCSS)) but might charge signficant setup time. The commercial line of tools (e.g. [Applitools](https://applitools.com/), [Percy.io](https://percy.io/)) takes is a step further by smoothing the installation and packing advanced features like management UI, alerting, smart capturing by elemeinating  \'visual noise\' (e.g. ads, animations) and even root cause analysis of the DOM/css changes that led to the issue\n\n<br/>\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** How good is a content page that display great content (100% tests passed), loads instantly but half of the content area is hidden?\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: A typical visual regression - right content that is served badly\n\n![alt text](assets/amazon-visual-regression.jpeg "Amazon page breaks")\n\n<br/>\n\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Configuring wraith to capture and compare UI snapshots\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa8%20Example%20using%20Wraith-blue.svg\n "Using Wraith")\n\n```\n\xe2\x80\x8b# Add as many domains as necessary.

Coverage is a measure of how many code lines (and branches, statements, etc) are being reached by the tests. So how much is enough? 10\xe2\x80\x9330% is obviously too low to get any sense about the build correctness, on the other side 100% is very expensive and might shift your focus from the critical paths to the exotic corners of the code. The long answer is that it depends on many factors like the type of application\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aif you\xe2\x80\x99re building the next generation of Airbus A380 than 100% is a must, for a cartoon pictures website 50% might be too much. Although most of the testing enthusiasts claim that the right coverage threshold is contextual, most of them also mention the number 80% as a thumb of a rule ([Fowler: \xe2\x80\x9cin the upper 80s or 90s\xe2\x80\x9d](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html)) that presumably should satisfy most of the applications.\n\nImplementation tips: You may want to configure your continuous integration (CI) to have a coverage threshold ([Jest link](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#collectcoverage-boolean)) and stop a build that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stand to this standard (it\xe2\x80\x99s also possible to configure threshold per component, see code example below). On top of this, consider detecting build coverage decrease (when a newly committed code has less coverage)\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8athis will push developers raising or at least preserving the amount of tested code. All that said, coverage is only one measure, a quantitative based one, that is not enough to tell the robustness of your testing. And it can also be fooled as illustrated in the next bullets\n\n<br/>\n\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:**  Confidence and numbers go hand in hand, without really knowing that you tested most of the system\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8athere will also be some fear. and fear will slow you down\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Example: A typical coverage report\n![alt text](assets/bp-18-yoni-goldberg-code-coverage.png "A typical coverage report")\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Setting up coverage per component (using Jest)\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/\xf0\x9f\x94\xa8%20Example%20using%20Jest-blue.svg\n "Using Jest")\n\n![alt text](assets/bp-18-code-coverage2.jpeg "Setting up coverage per component (using Jest)")\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f 4.2 Inspect coverage reports to detect untested areas and other oddities\n\n:white_check_mark: **Do:** Some issues sneak just under the radar and are really hard to find using traditional tools.

Gone are the days where linting was about cosmetics (no semi-colons!). Nowadays, Linters can catch severe issues like errors that are not thrown correctly and losing information. On top of your basic set of rules (like [ESLint standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-standard) or [Airbnb style](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)), consider including some specializing Linters like [eslint-plugin-chai-expect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-chai-expect) that can discover tests without assertions, [eslint-plugin-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-promise?activeTab=readme) can discover promises with no resolve (your code will never continue), [eslint-plugin-security](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-security?activeTab=readme) which can discover eager regex expressions that might get used for DOS attacks, and [eslint-plugin-you-dont-need-lodash-underscore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-you-dont-need-lodash-underscore) is capable of alarming when the code uses utility library methods that are part of the V8 core methods like Lodash._map(\xe2\x80\xa6)\n<br/>\n\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** Consider a rainy day where your production keeps crashing but the logs don\xe2\x80\x99t display the error stack trace.

Help developers run this pipeline also locally to solicit instant feedback and shorten the [feedback loop](https://www.gocd.org/2016/03/15/are-you-ready-for-continuous-delivery-part-2-feedback-loops/). Why? an efficient testing process constitutes many and iterative loops: (1) try-outs -> (2) feedback -> (3) refactor. The faster the feedback is, the more improvement iterations a developer can perform per-module and perfect the results. On the flip, when the feedback is late to come fewer improvement iterations could be packed into a single day, the team might already move forward to another topic/task/module and might not be up for refining that module.\n\nPractically, some CI vendors (Example: [CircleCI load CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/)) allow running the pipeline locally. Some commercial tools like [wallaby provide highly-valuable & testing insights](https://wallabyjs.com/) as a developer prototype (no affiliation). Alternatively, you may just add npm script to package.json that runs all the quality commands (e.g. test, lint, vulnerabilities)\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8ause tools like [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) for parallelization and non-zero exit code if one of the tools failed. Now the developer should just invoke one command\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8ae.g. \xe2\x80\x98npm run quality\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8ato get instant feedback.

In practice, executing 500 CPU-bounded unit test on a single thread can take too long. Luckily, modern test runners and CI platforms (like [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest), [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) and [Mocha extensions](https://github.com/yandex/mocha-parallel-tests)) can parallelize the test into multiple processes and achieve significant improvement in feedback time. Some CI vendors do also parallelize tests across containers (!) which shortens the feedback loop even further. Whether locally over multiple processes, or over some cloud CLI using multiple machines\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aparallelizing demand keeping the tests autonomous as each might run on different processes\n\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** Getting test results 1 hour long after pushing new code, as you already code the next features, is a great recipe for making testing less relevant\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Mocha parallel & Jest easily outrun the traditional Mocha thanks to testing parallelization ([Credit: JavaScript Test-Runners Benchmark](https://medium.com/dailyjs/javascript-test-runners-benchmark-3a78d4117b4))\n![alt text](assets/bp-24-yonigoldberg-jest-parallel.png "Mocha parallel & Jest easily outrun the traditional Mocha thanks to testing parallelization (Credit: JavaScript Test-Runners Benchmark)")\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f5.5 Stay away from legal issues using license and plagiarism check\n:white_check_mark: **Do:**    Licensing and plagiarism issues are probably not your main concern right now, but why not tick this box as well in 10 minutes? A bunch of npm packages like [license check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/license-checker) and [plagiarism check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plagiarism-checker) (commercial with free plan) can be easily baked into your CI pipeline and inspect for sorrows like dependencies with restrictive licenses or code that was copy-pasted from Stackoverflow and apparently violates some copyrights\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** Unintentionally, developers might use packages with inappropriate licenses or copy paste commercial code and run into legal issues\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Doing It Right Example:\n```javascript\n//install license-checker in your CI environment or also locally\nnpm install -g license-checker\n\n//ask it to scan all licenses and fail with exit code other than 0 if it found unauthorized license. The CI system should catch this failure and stop the build\nlicense-checker --summary --failOn BSD\n\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n![alt text](assets/bp-25-nodejs-licsense.png)\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f5.6 Constantly inspect for vulnerable dependencies\n:white_check_mark: **Do:**    Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities. This can get easily tamed using community tools such as [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/running-a-security-audit), or commercial tools like [snyk](https://snyk.io/) (offer also a free community version). Both can be invoked from your CI on every build\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** Keeping your code clean from vulnerabilities without dedicated tools will require to constantly follow online publications about new threats. Quite tedious\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap: Example: NPM Audit result\n![alt text](assets/bp-26-npm-audit-snyk.png "NPM Audit result")\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f5.7 Automate dependency updates\n:white_check_mark: **Do:**   Yarn and npm latest introduction of package-lock.json introduced a serious challenge (the road to hell is paved with good intentions)\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aby default now, packages are no longer getting updates. Even a team running many fresh deployments with \xe2\x80\x98npm install\xe2\x80\x99 & \xe2\x80\x98npm update\xe2\x80\x99 won\xe2\x80\x99t get any new updates. This leads to subpar dependent packages versions at best or to vulnerable code at worst. Teams now rely on developers goodwill and memory to manually update the package.json or use tools [like ncu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) manually. A more reliable way could be to automate the process of getting the most reliable dependency versions, though there are no silver bullet solutions yet there are two possible automation roads:\n\n(1) CI can fail builds that have obsolete dependencies\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8ausing tools like [\xe2\x80\x98npm outdated\xe2\x80\x99](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated) or \xe2\x80\x98npm-check-updates (ncu)\xe2\x80\x99 . Doing so will enforce developers to update dependencies.\n\n(2) Use commercial tools that scan the code and automatically send pull requests with updated dependencies. One interesting question remaining is what should be the dependency update policy\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aupdating on every patch generates too many overhead, updating right when a major is released might point to an unstable version (many packages found vulnerable on the very first days after being released, [see the](https://nodesource.com/blog/a-high-level-post-mortem-of-the-eslint-scope-security-incident/) eslint-scope incident).\n\nAn efficient update policy may allow some \xe2\x80\x98vesting period\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8alet the code lag behind the @latest for some time and versions before considering the local copy as obsolete (e.g. local version is 1.3.1 and repository version is 1.3.8)\n<br/>\n\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** Your production will run packages that have been explicitly tagged by their author as risky\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap:  Example: [ncu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) can be used manually or within a CI pipeline to detect to which extent the code lag behind the latest versions\n![alt text](assets/bp-27-yoni-goldberg-npm.png "Nncu can be used manually or within a CI pipeline to detect to which extent the code lag behind the latest versions")\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n## \xe2\x9a\xaa \xef\xb8\x8f 5.8 Other, non-Node related, CI tips\n:white_check_mark: **Do:**    This post is focused on testing advice that is related to, or at least can be exemplified with Node JS.

When developing reusable packages or running a multi-customer production with various configuration and Node versions, the CI must run the pipeline of tests over all the permutations of configurations. For example, assuming we use MySQL for some customers and Postgres for others\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8asome CI vendors support a feature called \xe2\x80\x98Matrix\xe2\x80\x99 which allow running the suit of testing against all permutations of MySQL, Postgres and multiple Node version like 8, 9 and 10. This is done using configuration only without any additional effort (assuming you have testing or any other quality checks). Other CIs who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support Matrix might have extensions or tweaks to allow that\n<br/>\n\n\n\xe2\x9d\x8c **Otherwise:** So after doing all that hard work of writing testing are we going to let bugs sneak in only because of configuration issues?\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<details><summary>\xe2\x9c\x8f <b>Code Examples</b></summary>\n\n<br/>\n\n### :clap:   Example: Using Travis (CI vendor) build definition to run the same test over multiple Node versions\n<pre name="f909" id="f909" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">language: node_js<br>node_js:<br>  - "7"<br>  - "6"<br>  - "5"<br>  - "4"<br>install:<br>  - npm install<br>script:<br>  - npm run test</pre>\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n# Team\n\n\n\n## Yoni Goldberg\n\n<br/>\n<img width="480px" src="assets/yoni-goldberg.jpg"/>\n<br/>\n\n**Role:** Writer\n\n**About:** I\'m an independent consultant who works with 500 fortune corporates and garage startups on polishing their JS & Node.js applications.
