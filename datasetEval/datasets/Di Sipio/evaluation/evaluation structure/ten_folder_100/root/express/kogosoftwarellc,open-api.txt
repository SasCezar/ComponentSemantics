The author has used other popular options out there (like lerna), and has found independent versioning to behave strangely with them.  Another goal with the current approach is to reduce boilerplate code as much as possible (something tools like lerna don\'t help with).  The inspiration for the current approach came from [boennemann/alle](https://github.com/boennemann/alle).  The author isn\'t\nmarried to the current approach, so if you have ideas on how to simplify the development of this monorepo by all means please [open an issue](https://github.com/kogosoftwarellc/open-api/issues/new)._\n\n### Typical Workflow for Contributors\n\nLet\'s say you\'re working on a package under [./packages](https://github.com/kogosoftwarellc/open-api/tree/master/packages).  Here\'s what you do:\n\n1. `cd open-api`\n1. `./bin/test packages/<package_you\'re_working_on>`\n1. Make your changes.\n  1. _Do not bump the version in package.json._  A maintainer will handle that once your PR is merged.\n1. Once you\'re satisfied with your changes:\n  1. Create a new branch `git checkout -b my-branch` (in case you haven\'t done so already).\n  1. `./bin/commit packages/<package_you\'re_working_on> \'commit message describing your change.  can be multi line here.  just close with a single quote like so:\'`\n  1. Push your change to your fork\n  1. Open a PR.\n\n### bin\n\nSeveral scripts have been created to aid in the development of this monorepo (see [./bin](./bin)).  They assume that your `$PWD` is the root of the repository.  Here is a brief summary of common actions:\n\n* Testing\n  * (Note: `./bin/test` will run `npm i` in the package _prior_ to running the tests)\n  * Test a single package - `./bin/test packages/<package_to_test>` (starts the test in watch mode)\n  * Test all packages - `./bin/test`\n* Commit changes to a package - `./bin/commit packages/<package_to_commit> \'Commit message\'` (the commit message will be prepended with the package name e.g. `<package_to_commit>: Commit message`\n\n#### dev-tools\nScripts in this directory wrap common tools, like `nyc`, `tsc`, and `mocha`.  They reduce boilerplate and are called from npm scripts.\n\n## LICENSE\n\n```\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2018 Kogo Software LLC\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
