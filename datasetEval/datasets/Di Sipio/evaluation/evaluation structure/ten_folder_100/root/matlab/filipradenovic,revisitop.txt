b'# Revisiting Oxford and Paris: Large-Scale Image Retrieval Benchmarking\n\nWe revisit and address issues with Oxford 5k and Paris 6k image retrieval benchmarks. New annotation for both datasets is created with an extra attention to the reliability of the ground truth and three new protocols of varying difficulty are introduced. We additionally introduce 15 new challenging queries per dataset and a new set of 1M hard distractors.\n\nThis package provides support in downloading and using the new benchmark.\n\n<img src="http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/revisitop/img/revisitop_teaser_medium.png" width=\\textwidth/>\n\n## MATLAB\n\nTested with MATLAB R2017a on Debian 8.1.\n\n### Process images\n\nThis example script first downloads dataset images and the revisited annotation files. Then, it describes how to: read and process database images; read, crop and process query images:\n```\n>> example_process_images\n```\nSimilarly, this example script first downloads one million images from the revisited distractor dataset (this can take a while). Then, it describes how to read and process images.\n```\n>> example_process_distractors\n```\n\n### Evaluate results\n\nExample script that describes how to evaluate according to the revisited annotation and the three protocol setups:\n```\n>> example_evaluate\n```\nIt automatically downloads dataset images, the revisited annotation file, and example features (R-[37]-GeM from the paper) to be used in the evaluation.\nThe final output should look like this (depending on the selected ```test_dataset```):\n```\n>> roxford5k: mAP E: 84.81, M: 64.67, H: 38.47\n>> roxford5k: mP@k[1 5 10] E: [97.06 92.06 86.49], M: [97.14 90.67 84.67], H: [81.43 63.00 53.00]\n```\nor\n```\n>> rparis6k: mAP E: 92.12, M: 77.20, H: 56.32\n>> rparis6k: mP@k[1 5 10] E: [100.00 97.14 96.14], M: [100.00 98.86 98.14], H: [94.29 90.29 89.14]\n```\n\n## Python\n\nTested with Python 3.5.3 on Debian 8.1.\n\n### Process images\n\nThis example script first downloads dataset images and the revisited annotation files.
