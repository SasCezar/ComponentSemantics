b'# Learning a Single Convolutional Super-Resolution Network for Multiple Degradations\n\n# Abstract\nRecent years have witnessed the unprecedented success of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in single image super-resolution (SISR). However, existing CNN-based SISR methods mostly assume that a low-resolution (LR) image is bicubicly downsampled from a high-resolution (HR) image, thus inevitably giving rise to poor performance when the true degradation does not follow this assumption. Moreover, they lack scalability in learning a single model to deal with multiple degradations. To address these issues, we propose a dimensionality stretching strategy that enables a single convolutional super-resolution network to take two key factors of the SISR degradation process, i.e., blur kernel and noise level, as input. Consequently, the proposed super-resolver can handle multiple and even spatially variant degradations, which significantly improves the practicability. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real LR images show that the proposed convolutional super-resolution network not only can produce favorable results on multiple degradations but also is computationally efficient, providing a highly effective and scalable solution to practical SISR applications.\n\n# Training

contrast to other CNN-based SISR methods which only take the LR image as input and lack scalability to handle other degradations, \nthe proposed network takes the concatenated LR image and degradation maps as input, thus allowing a single model to manipulate multiple \nand even spatially variant degradations.\n\n# NTIRE 2018 Challenge on Image Super-Resolution
