b'#     Image-feature-detection-using-Phase-Stretch-Transform\nPhase Stretch Transform (PST) is an operator that finds features\nin an image. PST takes an intensity image I as its input, and returns\na binary image out of the same size as I, with 1\'s where the function\nfinds sharp transitions in I and 0\'s elsewhere. PST function is also\nable to return the detected features in gray scale level (i.e.\nwithout thresholding).\n\nIn PST, the image is first filtered by passing through a\nsmoothing  filter followed by application of a nonlinear\nfrequency-dependent phase  described by the PST phase kernel. The\noutput of the transform is the  phase in the spatial domain. The main\nstep is the 2-D phase function (PST phase kernel) which is typically\napplied in the frequency domain. The amount of phase applied to the\nimage is frequency dependent with  higher amount of phase applied to\nhigher frequency features of the  image. Since sharp transitions,\nsuch as edges and corners, contain  higher frequencies, PST\nemphasizes the edge information. Features can be further enhanced by\napplying thresholding and morphological operations.
