b'# TCDCN face alignment tool \nMatlab implementation of facial landmark detection by deep multi-task learning.\n\nFor a Win32 binary version (faster), please go to: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/TCDCN.html\n\nFace alignment requires the bounding box from an external face detector. You may find a useful one from here: https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment.git\n\n\nThe provided tool is a re-implementation of the papers:\n\n[1] Zhanpeng Zhang, Ping Luo, Chen Change Loy, Xiaoou Tang. Facial Landmark Detection \n     by Deep Multi-task Learning, in Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014\n \n[2] Zhanpeng Zhang, Ping Luo, Chen Change Loy, Xiaoou Tang. Learning Deep Representation for Face Alignment  \n     with Auxiliary Attributes. to appear in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI).\n\n'
