b'FieldTrip is the MATLAB toolbox for MEG and EEG analysis that is being\ndeveloped at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour\ntogether with collaborating institutes.\n\nThe toolbox includes algorithms for simple and advanced analysis\nof MEG and EEG data, such as time-frequency analysis, source\nreconstruction using dipoles, distributed sources and beamformers\nand non-parametric statistical testing. It supports the data formats\nof all major MEG systems (CTF, Neuromag, 4D/BTi) and of the most popular\nEEG systems, and new formats can be added easily. FieldTrip contains\nhigh-level functions that you can use to construct your own analysis\nprotocol in MATLAB. Furthermore, it easily allows developers to\nincorporate low-level algorithms for new EEG/MEG analysis methods.\n\nFor more information please visit http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org\n\nThe FieldTrip software is free but copyrighted software, distributed\nunder the terms of the GNU General Public Licence as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation (either version 2, or at your option\nany later version).
