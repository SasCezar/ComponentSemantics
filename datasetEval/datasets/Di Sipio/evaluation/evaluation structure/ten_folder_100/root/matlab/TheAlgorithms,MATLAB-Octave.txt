b'# MATLAB / Octave\n\nThese repository is a collection of useful algorithms and data structures built in MATLAB/Octave. In addition you will find solutions from project euler problem sets. The code in this repository is cross-portabel for MATLAB and for Octave.\n\n### What is Octave?\n\n[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a free high-level interpreter language that is equivalent to the textuelle programming language MATLAB.\n\n### Overview about this repository\n\n---\n\n* project-euler\n  * Problem 1\n  * Problem 2\n  * Problem 3\n  * Problem 4\n\n* algorithms\n  * Sieve_of_Eratosthenes\n  * crypto\n    * sdbm-hash\n  * searching\n    * counting-sort\n  * Strings\n    * Palindrome\n  * maths\n    * to_polar\n  * other\n    * tic_tac_toe\n\n* machine-learning\n  * nearest neighbor\n     * brightness (recognizes the brightness of a color)\n  * k-means clustering\n  \n\n---\n\n### Contributing\n\nYou can like contribute to this repository.
