Many more features are included (see below). The code is suitable for the analysis of somatic imaging data. Improved implementation for the analysis of dendritic/axonal imaging data will be added in the future. \n\n\n## Features and methods included\n\n* **Source extraction** \n\n    * Separates different sources based on constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) [[1-2]](#neuron)\n    * Deals with heavily overlaping and neuropil contaminated movies     \n    * Selection of inferred sources using a [pre-trained convolutional neural network classifier](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn-MATLAB/wiki/Component-classification-with-a-convolutional-neural-network)\n    * [Component registration across different sessions/days](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn-MATLAB/wiki/Registering-ROIs-across-different-sessions-%5C--days) \n\n* **Denoising, deconvolution and spike extraction**\n\n    * Constrained foopsi method for inferring neural activity from fluorescence traces [[1]](#neuron)\n    * Near online implementation using the OASIS algorihtm [[3]](#oasis)\n    * MCMC algorithm for Bayesian spike inference [[4]](#mcmc)\n    \n* **Handling of very large datasets**\n\n    * [Memory mapping and parallel processing in patches](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn-MATLAB/wiki/Processing-of-large-datasets)\n    \n* **Motion correction**\n\n    * Fast parallelizable non-rigid motion correction using the NoRMCorre algorithm [[5]](#normcorre). Separate standalone package can be found [here](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/NoRMCorre). It will be included in this package in the future.\n    \nNew: Renaming to CaImAn-MATLAB\n======\nWe moved the code into the Flatiron Institute github account and renamed the repository to CaImAn-MATLAB to bring it more in touch with the [CaImAn](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/CaImAn) Python package. Everything else is the same.
