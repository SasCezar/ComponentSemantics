b'# MSS (Marine Systems Simulator)\n\nThe Marine Systems Simulator (MSS) is a Matlab/Simulink library for marine systems. It includes models for ships, underwater vehicles, and floating structures. The library also contains guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) blocks for real-time simulation. Please include the following reference when you use the GNC and HYDRO toolboxes: \n\nT. I. Fossen and T. Perez (2004). Marine Systems Simulator (MSS).\nURL: https://github.com/cybergalactic/MSS\n\nCopy the folder /MSS to your Matlab folder and "add the path with subfolders" to Matlab. Then type:\n\n    help MSS\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n GNC Toolbox\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nBasic libraries and system examples for guidance, navigation and control (GNC). The library contains:\n\n- M-file functions (kinematics and kinetics) and Simulink examples for time-domain GNC applications.\n- M-file library with vessels models, maneuvering trials, and dynamic simulation.\n- User editable m-files for simulation and control of ships, rigs and underwater vehicles.\n- Simulink toolbox for dynamic simulation of marine vessels and control systems. The Simulink library includes vessels models, autopilots, DP control systems, wave filters, guidance systems, actuator models and much more.\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n HYDRO Toolbox\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nThe toolbox reads output data files generated by hydrodynamic programs and processes the data for use in Matlab/Simulink. MSS Hydro includes several example vessels. In order to build your own model, you need a license for one of the following programs:\n\n- 2D strip theory programs - ShipX (Veres) by SINTEF OCEAN AS\n- 3D potential theory programs - WAMIT by WAMIT Inc.\n\nThe processed data can be used in real-time simulation of marine vessels in 6 DOF exposed to 1st- and 2nd-order wave loads (motion and force RAO transfer functions).\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nFDI Toolbox\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nThis is a stand-alone toolbox for identification of radiation-force models and fluid memory effects of marine structures such as marine craft and wave energy converters. Please include the following reference when you use the MSS FDI toolbox:\n\nT. Perez and T. I. Fossen (2009).
