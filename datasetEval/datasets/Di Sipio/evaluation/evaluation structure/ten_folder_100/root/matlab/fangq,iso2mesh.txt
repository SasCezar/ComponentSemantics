It contains \na rich set of mesh processing scripts/programs, working \neither independently or interacting with external free \nmeshing utilities. Iso2Mesh toolbox can directly convert\na 3D image stack, including binary, segmented or gray-scale \nimages such as MRI or CT scans, into quality volumetric \nmeshes. This makes it particularly suitable for multi-modality \nmedical imaging data analysis and multi-physics modeling.\nAbove all, iso2mesh is open-source. You can download it for \nfree. You are also allowed to extend the toolbox for your\nown research and share with other users. Iso2Mesh is \ncross-platform and is compatible with both MATLAB and GNU Octave \n(a free MATLAB clone).\n\nThe details of this toolbox can be found in the following\npapers:\n\n- Anh Phong Tran and Qianqian Fang, "Fast and high-quality tetrahedral mesh generation from neuroanatomical scans," arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.08954, 2017\n- Qianqian Fang and David Boas, "Tetrahedral mesh generation from volumetric binary and gray-scale images," Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2009), pp. 1142-1145, 2009\n\n\n#### Overview of the functions\n\nCreation of high-quality surface and tetrahedral meshes \nfrom volumetric images has been a challenging task. \nThere are very limited software and resources available \nfor this purpose. Commercial tools, such as Mimics \nand Simpleware, are both expensive and limited in flexibility. \nIso2Mesh was developed as a free alternative to these \nexpensive commercial tools and provides researchers a highly\nflexible, modular and streamlined image-based mesh \ngeneration pipeline. Intuitive interfaces and rich\nfunctionalities allow one to enjoy a wide range \nof mesh-based analyses, ranging from 3D volumetric \nimage pre-processing (hole-filling, thinning and \nthickening), surface mesh modeling (extraction, \nremeshing, repairing, and smoothing) to volumetric \nmesh creation.\n\nConverting 3D image stacks into quality surface and\ntetrahedral meshes is one of the core features of iso2mesh.\nWe provide serveral automated functions to perform\nthe image->mesh and mesh->image conversion, including\n\n- vol2mesh (v2m): convert a 3D volumetric image into a tetrahedral mesh\n- vol2surf (v2s): extract triangular surfaces from a 3D image volume\n- surf2mesh (s2m): create a tetrahedral mesh from a triangular surface mesh\n- surf2vol (s2v): rasterize a close-surface to a volumetric image\n- mesh2vol (m2v): rasterize a tetrahedral mesh to a volumetric image\n\nMost of these function are associated with several meshing\noptions and parameters to give users full control to mesh \ndensity, adaptivity, region labeling and mesh quality.\nThe output data for some of these functions can be used\nas the input for the others, giving endless combinations to\nanalyze your data. In addition to image-based mesh generation,\niso2mesh can also mesh geometry primitives such as spheres,\ncubes and cylinders. This makes iso2mesh a CAD-capable software,\nfully integrated in the MATLAB/Octave environments.\n\nAnother core feature of iso2mesh is surface mesh\nprocessing. A surface mesh is the bridge between a voxelated\nimage and a tetrahedral mesh, and is the foundation for \nsuccessful 3D mesh generation. In iso2mesh, we provide the\nfollowing key functions for surface mesh processing:\n\n- smoothsurf (sms): smoothing a surface mesh\n- surfboolean: boolean operations (join, intersect, diff) of two surfaces\n- meshresample: downsample a surface mesh to a coarse surface\n- meshrefine: refine a surface mesh\n- remeshsurf: remesh a surface mesh, including up-sampling and down-sampling\n- meshcheckrepair: test a surface mesh and remove defects and self-intersecting elements\n\nA third area iso2mesh excels is the rich set of mesh analysis \nand inquiry functions. For both surface and tetrahedral meshes, \niso2mesh can report the element volume (or area), mesh quality\nmetrics, node connectivity and neighbors, interior edges and \nboundaries, surface norms, element centroids, etc.\n\nLast, but not the least, iso2mesh can import and export mesh\ndata from/to a dozen of file formats, including those used by the \npopular FEA software like COMSOL and ABAQUS. The STL format can\nexport an iso2mesh-generated mesh for 3D printing.\nUsers can not only export the data to a file, but also make\n3D plots in MATLAB/Octave using the powerful "plotmesh" function.\n\nThese examples are only a small fraction in the over 100 optimized \nfunctions provided by iso2mesh. The modular design of iso2mesh \nmakes the code easy to understand and easy to be intergrated in \nyour data analysis workflow.

So, without needing \nto recompile, Iso2Mesh can be executed out-of-box on MATLAB or GNU Octave.\n\nHowever, in the event that your operating system is not supported, or\ndue to license restrictions, such as creating a release for various\nLinux distributions, you can recreate the mesh utility binaries under\niso2mesh/bin folder by following the below commands:\n\n ```  \ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fangq/iso2mesh.git\ncd iso2mesh\nrm -rf bin/*.mex* bin/*.exe\ncd tools\nmake clean\nmake\n```\n\nThis will download and recompile the below binaries in the bin folder:\n\n - cgalmesh\n - cgalsurf\n - cgalsimp2\n - jmeshlib\n - meshfix\n - tetgen1.5\n - cork\n\nOnce these binary files are recreated, you can run all the major functionalities\nof Iso2Mesh. The gtsset and gtrefine tools are depreciated and replaced by \ncork and tetgen.\n\nTo compile the above external tools, the below tools must be pre-installed\n(tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, if you use another Linux distribution, the package\nnames might be different)\n\n- libcgal-dev\n- clang\n- cmake\n\nyou can install these on Ubuntu by running:\n\n ``` sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev clang cmake```\n \n\n#### Acknowledgement\n\nThis toolbox interacts with a number external meshing tools \nto perform the essential functionalities.
