Given a set of images jointly covering object instances of a specific category, instance co-segmentation aims to identify all of these instances and segment each of them, i.e. generating one mask for each instance. This task is important since instance-level segmentation is preferable for humans and many vision applications. It is also challenging because no pixel-wise annotated training data are available and the number of instances in each image is unknown. We solve this task by dividing it into two sub-tasks, co-peak search and instance mask segmentation. In the former sub-task, we develop a CNN-based network to detect the co-peaks as well as co-saliency maps for a pair of images. A co-peak has two endpoints, one in each image, that are local maxima in the response maps and similar to each other. Thereby, the two endpoints are potentially covered by a pair of instances of the same category. In the latter subtask, we design a ranking function that takes the detected co-peaks and co-saliency maps as inputs and can select the object proposals to produce the final results. Our method for instance co-segmentation and its variant for object colocalization are evaluated on four datasets, and achieve favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n## Examples \nTwo examples of instance co-segmentation on categories bird and sheep, respectively. An instance here refers to an object appearing in an image. In each example, the top row gives the input images while the bottom row shows the instances segmented by our method. The instance-specific coloring indicates that our method produces a segmentation mask for each instance.\n\n<p align="center">\n<img src="https://github.com/KuangJuiHsu/DeepCO3/blob/master/Image/CVPR19_Example.PNG" width="800"/>\n</p>\n\n## Overview of our method\nThe proposed method contains two stages, co-peak search within the blue-shaded background and instance mask segmentation within the red-shaded background. For searching co-peaks in a pair of images, our model extracts image features, estimates their co-saliency maps, and performs feature correlation for co-peak localization. The model is optimized by three losses, including the co-peak loss, the affinity loss, and the saliency loss. For instance mask segmentation, we design a ranking function taking the detected co-peaks, the co-saliency maps, and the object proposals as inputs, and select the top-ranked proposal for each detected instance.\n\n<p align="center">\n<img src="https://github.com/KuangJuiHsu/DeepCO3/blob/master/Image/CVPR19_Overview.PNG" height="400"/>\n</p>\n\n## Results\n+ Instance co-segmentation\n\nThe performance of instance co-segmentation on the four collected datasets is shown.
