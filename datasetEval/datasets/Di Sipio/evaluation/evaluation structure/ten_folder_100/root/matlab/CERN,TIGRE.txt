Its focus is on iterative algorithms \r\nfor improved image quality that have all been optimized to run on GPUs \r\n(including multi-GPUs)<sup>1</sup> for improved speed.  It combines the higher level \r\nabstraction of MATLAB or Python<sup>1</sup>  with the performance of CUDA at a lower level in order to make \r\nit both fast and easy to use.\r\n\r\nTIGRE is free to download and distribute: use it, modify it, add to it, \r\nshare it.  Our aim is to provide a wide range of easy-to-use algorithms \r\nfor the tomographic community "off the shelf".  We would like to build a \r\nstronger bridge between algorithm developers and imaging \r\nresearchers/clinicians by encouraging and supporting contributions from \r\nboth sides into TIGRE.\r\n\r\nTIGRE remains under development as we are still adding new features \r\n(e.g., motion compensation).  If you have any request for a specific \r\napplication, do not hesitate to [contact us](#contact)!\r\n\r\n - [TIGRE features](#features)\r\n \r\n - [Installation instructions](#installation)\r\n \r\n - [FAQ](#faq)\r\n  \r\n - [Further reading](#further-reading)\r\n \r\n - [Contact](#contact) \r\n \r\n - [Licensing](#licensing)\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Semi-stable code available in branches, soon to be available in the main code. Use at your own risk.\r\n\r\n## TIGRE features\r\n\r\nTIGRE is a GPU-based CT reconstruction software repository that contains a wide variety of iterative algorithms.\r\n\r\n- **MATLAB** and **Python** libraries for high-performance x-ray absorption tomographic reconstruction.\r\n\r\n- State-of-the-art implementations of projection and backprojection operations on **GPUs** (including **multi-GPUs**), with a simple interface using higher level languages to facilitate the development of new methods.\r\n\r\n- **Flexible CT geometry:** Cone Beam, Parallel Beam, Digital Tomosynthesis, C-arm CT, and any other geometry.  Geometric parameters are defined per projection, not per scan.\r\n\r\n- A wide range of reconstruction algorithms for CT.\r\n\r\n    - Filtered backprojection (FBP,FDK) and variations (different filters, Parker weights, ...)\r\n   \r\n    - **Iterative algorithms**\r\n       \r\n        - Gradient-based algorithms (SART, OS-SART, SIRT) with multiple tuning parameters (Nesterov acceleration, initialization, parameter reduction, ...)\r\n       \r\n        - Krylov subspace algorithms (CGLS)\r\n       \r\n        - Statistical reconstruction (MLEM)\r\n       \r\n        - Total variation regularization based algorithms: FISTA-based (SART-TV) and POCS-based (ASD-POCS, OS-ASD-POCS, B-ASD-POCS-\xce\xb2, PCSD, AwPCSD, Aw-ASD-POCS)\r\n       \r\n- TV denoising for 3D images.\r\n       \r\n- Basic image loading functionality.\r\n       \r\n- A variety of plotting functions.\r\n       \r\n- Image quality metrics.\r\n    \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nMATLAB and Python builds are both fully supported.\r\n\r\n- [Installation instructions and requirements for MATLAB](Frontispiece/MATLAB_installation.md).\r\n\r\n- [Installation instructions and requirements for Python](Frontispiece/python_installation.md). **NOTE: python code works, but its subomtimal. We are working on fixing this currently [14/05/2019]**\r\n\r\n**Advanced, not required to run TIGRE**, will change the source code. Only do if performance is critical.\r\n\r\n- [Tune TIGRE for machine.
