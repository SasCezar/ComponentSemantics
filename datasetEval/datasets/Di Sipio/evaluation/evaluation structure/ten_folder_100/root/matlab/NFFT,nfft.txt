It implements the following\ntransforms:\n\n1. Non-equispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT)\n    - forward transform *(NFFT)*, i.e. frequency to time/space domain\n    - adjoint transform *(adjoint NFFT)*, i.e. time/space to frequency domain\n\n2. Generalisations\n    - to arbitrary nodes in time *and* frequency domain *(NNFFT)*\n    - to real-valued data, i.e. (co)sine transforms, *(NFCT, NFST)*\n    - to the sphere S^2 *(NFSFT)*\n    - to the rotation group *(NFSOFT)*\n    - to the hyperbolic cross *(NSFFT)*\n\n3. Generalised inverse transformations based on iterative methods, e.g. CGNR/CGNE\n\nSome examples for application of these transforms are provided:\n\n1. Medical imaging\n    - magnetic resonance imaging\n    - computerised tomography\n\n2. Summation schemes\n    - fast Gauss transform (FGT)\n    - singular kernels\n    - zonal kernels\n\n3. polar FFT, discrete Radon transform, ridgelet transform\n\nDetailed API documentation in HTML format can be found in\n`doc/api/html/index.html`, if you are working from a release tarball.\nWhen working from a source repository, the documentation can be\ngenerated with Doxygen.\n```\nmake doc\n```\n\nBuilding\n--------\nThe NFFT depends on the [FFTW](https://fftw.org) library, which is available for many Linux distros and MSYS. If you compile the FFTW yourself, it should be configured `--enable-shared`.\n\nWhen working from a source repository, you need to run libtoolize and autoreconf first. A bash script to do this is provided.\n```\n./bootstrap.sh\n```\n\nThe rest of the build process is standard.\n```\n./configure --enable-all --enable-openmp [add options as necessary, see below]\n```\n\nAlternatively, you might run the configure script for Matlab.\n```\n./configure --enable-all --enable-openmp --with-matlab=/path/to/matlab\n```\n\nHere are some useful optional flags for `./configure`:\n* `--enable-all` specifies that all modules should be compiled,\n* `--enable-openmp` enables the multicore support and\n* `--enable-julia` specifies that the julia interface will be compiled.\n* `--with-matlab=path/to/matlab` specifies a path of Matlab, and\n* `--with-octave=path/to/octave` does the same for GNU Octave.\n* For a list of all available options, run `./configure --help`.\n\nBuild the software.\n```\nmake\n```\n\nOptionally, unit tests may be run.\n```\nmake check\n```\n\nOptionally, install NFFT on your system.\n```\nmake install\n```\n\nCiting\n------\nThe most current general paper, the one that we recommend if you wish to cite NFFT, is *Keiner, J., Kunis, S., and Potts, D.\n''Using NFFT 3 - a software library for various nonequispaced fast Fourier transforms''\nACM Trans. Math. Software,36, Article 19, 1-30, 2009*.\n\nFeedback\n--------\nYour comments are welcome! This is the third version of the library and may\nnot be as robust or well documented as it should be.
