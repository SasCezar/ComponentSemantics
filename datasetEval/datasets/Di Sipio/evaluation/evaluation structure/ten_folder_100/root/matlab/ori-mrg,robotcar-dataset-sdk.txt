b'RobotCar Dataset SDK\n====================\nThis repo contains sample MATLAB and Python code for viewing and manipulating data from the [Oxford Robotcar Dataset](http://robotcar-dataset.robots.ox.ac.uk) and [Oxford Radar Robotcar Dataset](http://ori.ox.ac.uk/datasets/radar-robotcar-dataset).\n\nDirectories\n-----------\n`extrinsics`: Extrinsic calibrations between the sensors on the vehicle\n\n`matlab`: Sample matlab code for viewing and manipulating data\n\n`models`: Camera models. See the sample python or matlab code for how to use these\n\n`python`: Sample python code for viewing and manipulating data\n\n`tags`: Lists of tags for each dataset\n\nObtaining Data\n--------------\n### Oxford RobotCar Dataset\n\nTo obtain the data, please visit the dataset [website](http://robotcar-dataset.robots.ox.ac.uk).\nDownloads are chunked into `.tar` files containing no more than 5GB each, where each chunk corresponds to the same\ntime window for all sensors.\n\nIt is recommended that you extract all tar files to the same directory - this will leave all the data in a sensible\nheirarchical directory structure.\n\nAn example script for scraping the dataset website can be found at [RobotCarDataset-Scraper](https://github.com/mttgdd/RobotCarDataset-Scraper).\n\n### Oxford Radar Robotcar Dataset\n\nTo obtain the data, please visit the dataset [website](http://ori.ox.ac.uk/datasets/radar-robotcar-dataset).\nDownloads are separated into individual zip files for each sensor, for each traversal.\n\nIt is recommended that you extract all tar files to the same directory - this will leave all the data in a sensible\nheirarchical directory structure.\n\nAn example script for scraping the dataset website can be found at [radar-robotcar-dataset-sdk](https://github.com/dbarnes/radar-robotcar-dataset-sdk).\n'
