b'# Project Pages\n\nProject Pages is Jekyll Template specifically geared towards collaborative science. For more information, click [here](https://github.com/projectpages/project-pages/wiki/).\n\n# Nav Bar Jumbles\n\nIf you have seemingly random pages popping up on your Nav Bar recently, this is due to the fact that GitHub/Jekyll changed a fundemental rule they used to render pages. \n\n## CAUSE:\nIt used to be that if a markdown file didn\'t have `---` frontmatter at the beginning, it wasn\'t rendered as a page. This was changed very recently (like in the last 2 days) so that every markdown file anywhere no matter what gets rendered as a page.  \n\n## FIX:\n\n1) Go to:\n\n`project-pages/plugin/projector/` or `yourreponame/plugin/projector/` and delete the `README.md` file. This can be done graphically for the non-Git-savvy by simply going to your:\n\nGitHub account -> Your Profile -> Repositories -> Project-Pages/Your Repo -> Plugin -> projector \n\nand clicking on the files, then clicking on the "thrash can / delete this file" icon on the top right corner of the file.\n\n2) Go to:\n\n`project-pages/css/theme/` or `yourreponame/css/theme/` and delete the `README.md` file. This can be done graphically for the non-Git-savvy by simply going to your:\n\nGitHub account -> Your Profile -> Repositories -> Project-Pages/Your Repo -> Plugin -> projector \n\nand clicking on the files, then clicking on the "thrash can / delete this file" icon on the top right corner of the file.\n'
