b'# LightNet: A Versatile, Standalone Matlab-based Environment for Deep Learning\n\n![LightNet Icon](LightNet.png)\n\nLightNet is a lightweight, versatile and purely Matlab-based deep learning framework. The aim of the design is to provide an easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and efficient computational platform for deep learning research. The implemented framework supports major deep learning architectures such as the Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). LightNet supports both CPU and GPU for computation and the switch between them is straightforward. Different applications in computer vision, natural language processing and robotics are demonstrated as experiments.\n\n## How to use LightNet\n\nRead the tutorial slides in the Documentations folder.  \nInstall the latest Matlab (**R2016b or later**) on a computer, and run the RunAll.m Matlab script.  \nHave fun!  \nMore details can be found in the supplementary materials.  \n\n## Recent updates\n\n20160528: LightNet supports using pretrained ImageNet network models. \n![coco](coco.png)\n\nCheck CNN/Main_CNN_ImageNet_Minimal()\n\nAn example recognition using imagenet-vgg-f pretrained net:\n\n![ImageNet Icon](ImageNetPreTrain.png)\n\n20170217: CUDNN is supported by installing Neural Network Toolbox from Mathworks. The convolutional network training is over 10x faster than the previous release! The current version can process 10,000 CIFAR-10 images per second in the training.\n\n\n20170924: A simple example of training a Quasi-RNN is added to LightNet. Quasi-RNNs are much easier to parallelize compared to RNNs. \n\n\n## Major functions in LightNet\n  \n####network related:  \nMain_Template: a template script used to train CNN and MLP networks.  \nTrainingScript: a training template for CNN and MLP networks.  \ntrain_net: running the network in the training mode to evaluate and calculate the loss and gradients.  \ntest_net: running the network in the testing mode to evaluate the current parameters.  \nnet_ff: implementation of the feed forward process which is used in CNN and MLP networks.  \nnet_bp: implementation of the back propagation process which is used in CNN and MLP networks.  \nnet_init*: how to initialize a neural network.  \n  \n####layers:  \nlinear_layer: implementation of (fully-connected) linear layer.
