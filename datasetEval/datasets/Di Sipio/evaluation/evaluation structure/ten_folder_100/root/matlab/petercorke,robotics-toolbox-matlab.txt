There are more people participating and you'll likely get a quicker response.\n\n---\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThis toolbox brings robotics specific functionality to MATLAB, exploiting the native capabilities of MATLAB (linear algebra, portability, graphics).\n\nThe Toolbox uses a very general method of representing the kinematics and dynamics of serial-link manipulators as MATLAB\xc2\xae  objects \xe2\x80\x93  robot objects can be created by the user for any serial-link manipulator and a number of examples are provided for well known robots from Kinova, Universal Robotics, Rethink as well as classical robots such as the Puma 560 and the Stanford arm.\n\nThe toolbox also supports mobile robots with functions for robot motion models (unicycle, bicycle), path planning algorithms (bug, distance transform, D*, PRM), kinodynamic planning (lattice, RRT), localization (EKF, particle filter), map building (EKF) and simultaneous localization and mapping (EKF), and a Simulink model a of non-holonomic vehicle.  The Toolbox also including a detailed Simulink model for a quadrotor flying robot.\n\nAdvantages of the Toolbox are that:\n\n  * the code is mature and provides a point of comparison for other implementations of the same algorithms;\n  * the routines are generally written in a straightforward manner which allows for easy understanding, perhaps at the expense of computational efficiency. If you feel strongly about computational efficiency then you can always rewrite the function to be more efficient, compile the M-file using the MATLAB compiler, or create a MEX version;\n  * since source code is available there is a benefit for understanding and teaching.\n  \nThis Toolbox dates back to 1993 and significantly predates the [Robotics Systems Toolbox&reg;](https://www.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html) from MathWorks.  The former is free, open and not supported, while the latter is a fully supported commercial product.\n\n## Code Example\n\n```matlab\n>> mdl_puma560\n>> p560\np560 = \n\nPuma 560 [Unimation]:: 6 axis, RRRRRR, stdDH, fastRNE            \n - viscous friction; params of 8/95;                             \n+---+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\n| j |     theta |         d |         a |     alpha |    offset |\n+---+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\n|  1|         q1|          0|          0|     1.5708|          0|\n|  2|         q2|          0|     0.4318|          0|          0|\n|  3|         q3|    0.15005|     0.0203|    -1.5708|          0|\n|  4|         q4|     0.4318|          0|     1.5708|          0|\n|  5|         q5|          0|          0|    -1.5708|          0|\n|  6|         q6|          0|          0|          0|          0|\n+---+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\n \n>> p560.fkine([0 0 0 0 0 0])  % forward kinematics\nans = \n         1         0         0    0.4521\n         0         1         0     -0.15\n         0         0         1    0.4318\n         0         0         0         1\n```\n\nWe can animate a path\n\n![Puma robot animation](doc/figs/move2ball.gif)\n\n```matlab\nmdl_puma560\n\np = [0.8 0 0];\nT = transl(p) * troty(pi/2);\nqr(1) = -pi/2;\nqqr = p560.ikine6s(T, 'ru');\nqrt = jtraj(qr, qqr, 50);\n\nplot_sphere(p, 0.05, 'y');\np560.plot3d(qrt, 'view', ae, 'movie', 'move2ball.gif');\n```\n\n### Quadrotor animation\n\nMobile robot lifting off and hovering over a point following a circular trajectory, while also slowly turning.\n\n```matlab\n>> sl_quadrotor\n```\n\n![Quadrotor animation](doc/figs/quad.gif)\n\n### Mobile robot animation\nCar-like mobile robot doing a 3-point turn computed using the Reeds-Shepp planner\n\n![Mobile robot particle filter animation](doc/figs/3point.gif)\n\n```matlab\nq0 = [0 0 0]'; % initial configuration [x y theta]\nqf = [0 0 pi]'; % final configuration\nmaxcurv = 1/5;   % 5m turning circle\nrs = ReedsShepp(q0, qf, maxcurv, 0.05)\n\n% set up a vehicle model for animation\n[car.image,~,car.alpha] = imread('car2.png');\ncar.rotation = 180; % degrees\ncar.centre = [648; 173]; % pix\ncar.length = 4.2; % m\n\n% setup the plot\nclf; plotvol([-4 8 -6 6])\na = gca;\na.XLimMode = 'manual';\na.YLimMode = 'manual';\nset(gcf, 'Color', 'w')\ngrid on\na = gca;\nxyzlabel\n\n% now animate\nplot_vehicle(rs.path, 'model', car, 'trail', 'r:', 'movie', '3point.gif');\n```\n\n### Particle filter localization animation\n\nMobile robot localizing from beacons using a particle filter.\n\n![Mobile robot particle filter animation](doc/figs/pf.gif)\n\n```matlab\nV = diag([0.1, 1*pi/180].^2);\nveh = Vehicle(V);\nveh.add_driver( RandomPath(10) );\nmap = Map(20, 10);\nW = diag([0.1, 1*pi/180].^2);\nL = diag([0.1 0.1]);\nQ = diag([0.1, 0.1, 1*pi/180]).^2;\n\npf = ParticleFilter(veh, sensor, Q, L, 1000, 'movie', 'pf.mp4');\npf.run(100);\n```\n\nA fully commented version of this is provided in the LiveScript `demos/particlefilt.mlx`.\n\n## What's new\n\n* Travis CI is now running on the code base\n* All code related to pose representation has been split out into the [Spatial Math Toolbox](https://github.com/petercorke/spatial-math).  This repo is now a dependency.\n* `SerialLink` class has a `twists` method which returns a vector of `Twist` objects, one per joint.  This supports the product of exponential formulation for forward kinematics and Jacobians.\n* a prototype URDF parser\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install from shared MATLAB Drive folder\n\nThis will work for MATLAB Online or MATLAB Desktop provided you have [MATLAB drive](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-drive.html) setup.\n\n1. Click on the appropriate link below and an invitation to share will be emailed to the address associated with your MATLAB account:\n\n  * [RVC 2nd edition RTB10+MVTB4 (2017)](https://drive.matlab.com/sharing/e5e3ffef-f3d4-4f70-88a4-1ea0db0efb1a)\n  * [RVC 1st edition: RTB9+MVTB3 (2011)](https://drive.matlab.com/sharing/0442fc1b-5b9e-45c8-abf9-54cbbd00082a)\n\n2. Accept the invitation.\n3. A folder named RVC1  or RVC2 will appear in your MATLAB drive folder.\n4. Use the MATLAB file browser and navigate to the folder RVCx/rvctools and double-click the script named startup_rvc.m\n\nNote that this is a combo-installation that includes the Machine Vision Toolbox (MVTB) as well.\n\n### Install from github\n\nYou need to have a recent version of MATLAB, R2016b or later.\n\nThe Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB has dependency on two other GitHub repositories: [`spatial-math`](https://github.com/petercorke/spatial-math) and [`toolbox-common-matlab`](https://github.com/petercorke/toolbox-common-matlab).  \n\nTo install the Toolbox on your computer from github follow these simple instructions.\n\nFrom the shell:\n\n```shell\nmkdir rvctools\ncd rvctools\ngit clone https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-matlab.git robot\ngit clone https://github.com/petercorke/spatial-math.git smtb\ngit clone https://github.com/petercorke/toolbox-common-matlab.git common\nmake -C robot\n```\nThe last command builds the MEX files and Java class files. Then, from within MATLAB\n```matlab\n>> addpath rvctools/common  %  rvctools is the same folder as above\n>> startup_rvc\n```\nThe second line sets up the MATLAB path appropriately but it's only for the current session.  You can either:\n1. Repeat this everytime you start MATLAB\n2. Add the MATLAB commands above to your `startup.m` file\n3. Once you have run startup_rvc, run `pathtool` and push the `Save` button, this will save the path settings for subsequent sessions.\n\n\n## Online resources:\n\n* [Home page](http://www.petercorke.com)\n* [Discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/robotics-tool-box?hl=en)\n\nPlease email bug reports, comments or code contribtions to me at rvc@petercorke.com\n  \n\n## Contributors\n\nContributions welcome.
