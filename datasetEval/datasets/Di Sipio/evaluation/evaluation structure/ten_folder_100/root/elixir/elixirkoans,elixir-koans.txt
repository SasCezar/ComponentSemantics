b'# Elixir Koans\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elixirkoans/elixir-koans.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elixirkoans/elixir-koans)\n\nElixir koans is a fun way to get started with the elixir programming language. It is a tour\nof the most important features and idiomatic usage of the language.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nYou need to have Elixir installed. Please refer to the [official guide](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html) for instructions.\n\nFirst, clone the repo from GitHub:\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/elixirkoans/elixir-koans.git\n$ cd elixir-koans/\n```\n\nNext, fetch mix dependencies by running:\n\n```sh\n$ mix deps.get\n```\n\nYou might get prompted to install further dependencies. Reply "y".\n\nOn Linux, you\'ll need to install `inotify-tools` to be able\nto use the autorunner in this project.\n\n### Running\n\nWith the dependencies installed, navigate to the root directory of this project and run:\n\n```sh\n$ mix meditate\n```\n\nYou should see the first failure. Open the corresponding file in your favourite text editor\nand fill in the blanks to make the koans pass one by one.\nThe autorunner will give you feedback each time you save.\n\n\nIf you want the autorunner to show you your previous results, run it with `--no-clear-screen`\n```sh\n$ mix meditate --no-clear-screen\n```\n\nIf you want to jump to a specific lesson, run it with `--koan=<koan name>`\n```sh\n$ mix meditate --koan=PatternMatching\n```\n\nAny typos on the koan name will show the complete list of koans, where you can pick any.\n\n\n### Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions! If something does not make sense along the way or you feel\nlike an important lesson is missing from the koans, feel free to fork the project\nand open a pull request.\n\nList of [contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md).\n'
