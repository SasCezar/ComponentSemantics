To start translating you need to copy a file from the English language to the corresponding folder in your language and start translating.\n\n2. Translated lessons must include page metadata.\n   * `title` should be a translation of the original lesson's `title`.\n   * `version` should be set to the original English `version`.\n\n   For example `/ja/lessons/basics/basics.md`:\n\n  ```yaml\n  ---\n  title: \xe5\x9f\xba\xe6\x9c\xac\n  version: 1.0.0\n  ---\n  ```\n  \n3.
