The purpose of the distillery is to take something and break it down to its\ncomponent parts, reassembling it into something better, more powerful. That is exactly\nwhat this project does - it takes your Mix project and produces an Erlang/OTP release, a\ndistilled form of your raw application\'s components; a single package which can be deployed anywhere,\nindependently of an Erlang/Elixir installation. No dependencies, no hassle.\n\nThis is a pure-Elixir, dependency-free implementation of release generation for Elixir projects.\nIt is currently a standalone package, but may be integrated into Mix at some point in the future.\n\n## Installation\n\nDistillery requires Elixir 1.6 or greater. It works with Erlang 20+.\n\n```elixir\ndefp deps do\n  [{:distillery, "~> 2.1"}]\nend\n```\n\nJust add as a mix dependency and use `mix distillery.release`.\n\nIf you are new to releases or Distillery, please review the [documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/distillery),\nit is extensive and covers just about any question you may have!\n\n## Community/Questions/etc.\n\nIf you have questions or want to discuss Distillery, releases, or other deployment\nrelated topics, a good starting point is the Deployment section of ElixirForum, which\ncan be found [here](https://elixirforum.com/c/dedicated-sections/deployment).\n\nI can often be found in IRC on freenode, in the `#elixir-lang` channel, and there is\nalso an [Elixir Slack channel](https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com) as well, though I don\'t frequent that myself, there are\nmany people who can answer questions there.\n\nFailing that, feel free to open an issue on the tracker with questions, and I\'ll do my\nbest to get to it in a timely fashion!\n\n## License\n\nMIT.
