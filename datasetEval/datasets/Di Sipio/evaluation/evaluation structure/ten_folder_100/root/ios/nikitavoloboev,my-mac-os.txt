b'# My wonderful world of macOS [![Thanks](http://bit.ly/saythankss)](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev)\n\n> List of applications and tools that make my macOS experience even more amazing\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/master/desktop.png)\n\n> All the apps are in one desktop because there is delay in switching between macOS multiple desktops\n\n#### Contents\n\n- [Applications](#applications)\n  - [Productivity](#productivity)\n  - [Code](#code)\n  - [Social](#social)\n  - [Writing](#writing)\n  - [Design](#design)\n  - [Music](#music)\n  - [Images](#images)\n  - [Video](#video)\n  - [Utilities](#utilities)\n  - [Browsers](#browsers)\n    - [Safari Extensions](#safari-extensions)\n- [Command Line Apps](#command-line-apps)\n- [Preference Panes](#preference-panes)\n- [My wonderful world of iOS](#my-wonderful-world-of-ios-)\n- [Similar Setups](#similar-setups)\n- [Related](#related)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n## Applications\n\nI use a lot of applications on my mac. Below is a list of the ones that I love and use the most in my day to day life.\n\nI also share [my dotfiles](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles#readme) together with my [iOS setup](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme). And I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BBKnQU4_rty6_942PFbPbw) to discuss all things macOS/iOS.\n\n### Productivity\n\n#### [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) - Launcher\n\n- Alfred is a powerful launcher that you can program to show anything you want. It saved me a lot of time in my life.\n\n<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Bx5FLnO.png" width="700" alt="img">\n\n- It has a great [community](http://www.alfredforum.com/) and [amazing workflows](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows#readme) that you can use.\n\n- I wrote [an article](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/writing-alfred-workflows-in-go-2a44f62dc432) on how anyone can start developing workflows of their own using Go language and [AwGo](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo) library.\n\n#### [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) - Keyboard remapping\n\n- Karabiner is an absolutely amazing app that [lets you remap keys at a very low level on macOS](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6).\n- I have completely remapped my keyboard with it and every key on my keyboard is a custom modifier key that I can program to do what I want.\n- For example you can make caps lock into an escape key when pressed once but if you hold it, it becomes a [hyper key](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6). Hyper key means that a key now serves two purposes, once when pressed alone and once when held down. So for example, for remapping caps lock, we can remap it to act as escape when pressed alone once but if we hold down on it, it becomes `\xe2\x8c\x98 + \xe2\x8c\x83` modifier key. So `Caps Lock + F` becomes `\xe2\x8c\x98 + \xe2\x8c\x83 + F`. And so on.\n- I take this idea further and define these kind of hyper keys for **every single key on my keyboard**.\n- I describe how I use Karabiner in detail [here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macos/macos-apps/karabiner) and I generate [my configuration](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/karabiner/karabiner.edn) with a [Karabiner DSL](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo#readme).\n\n#### [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) - Automation tool\n\n- Keyboard Maestro is essentially an IDE for automation. You create macros of actions that you can then easily call from Karabiner.\n- It has a [wonderful community](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/) that is happy to help with whatever you are trying to achieve.\n- I share [all the macros I use](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros) with the app.\n\n#### [2Do](http://www.2doapp.com/mac) - Flexible task manager\n\n- I love GTD methodology. This app is phenomenal with helping me [organize my tasks](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/2do). Here is how my sidebar looks:\n\n<img src="https://i.imgur.com/s60rWyb.png" width="150">\n\n- It also has global quick add with a hotkey. Together with lists, priorities, powerful search and a lot more.\n\n<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QuBsexM.png" width="400" alt="img">\n\n#### [Trello](https://trello.com) - Project management tool\n\n- I use the app a lot to track various projects I have in my life.\n- I share many boards I made [publicly](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-trello). Here is an example of a public board for tracking various [things I want to learn](https://trello.com/b/cu32qF3q).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U0KSBJT.png)\n\n- I assign myself to the cards I am working on now and filter to see only them by [pressing Q key](https://trello.com/shortcuts). I mark cards I want to work on next with `Next` tag.\n\n#### [1Password](https://1password.com) - Password manager\n\n- Generate all of my passwords with it and keep everything in a secured and encrypted vault kept secure by my one master password.\n- No longer need to remember passwords and I now have a unique password for every website that I am signed up on whilst [activating two factor authentication](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/) wherever possible.\n\n#### [Timing](https://timingapp.com/?) - Automatic time tracker\n\n- I use Timing app to fully automate tracking my time on my computer.\n- The fact that I can combine active and passive tracking together is very powerful and allows me to be more aware of where I spend my time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/w4ERlN0.png)\n\n#### [MindNode](https://mindnode.com) - Interactive Mind Mapping\n\n- An application which allowed me to originally create all of the maps for [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz).\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-anything/2017-release/master/media/header.png)\n\n- I use MindNode to [visually break down problems I am trying to solve](../research/solving-problems.md).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qHAJdYk.png)\n\n- And I visualize topics and their relations as an [interactive mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/dPmKpWZgTpZsaG4Rf1yaz7rXbYhnuqPDDpdss4w2#1594.8,-1084.6,1).

This app is a huge upgrade over Preview app that I used before.\n- Multiple tabs, sepia mode, very nice annotation tools, great search, performance.\n\n#### [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) - Calendar\n\n- I use the app to manage events in my life.\n- I take great use of Fantastical\'s natural language input and I use [many Typinator expansions](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr) to ease this process.\n- I always view my events from `Week` view. And show 5 days with 16h shown for all days. This lets me have a perspective over what I have to do now. What deadlines I have to complete soon. And gives me the freedom to adjust my schedule in light of upcoming deadlines and events.\n\n#### [Contexts](https://contexts.co) - Window switcher\n\n- Allows me to fuzzy search through all the currently active windows that I have.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VdNRlGM.png)\n\n- Makes jumping to the right window I need effortless.

Here is how mine looks:\n\n<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0spRNfF.png" width="500" alt="img">\n\n- My menu bar is always hidden so I rarely ever use it and I show most needed info on the [TouchBar](btt#readme) instead.\n\n#### [Focus](https://heyfocus.com) - Block distracting websites\n\n- I use [Focus app](https://heyfocus.com) as a recurring [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) which lets me work in sessions of 80 minutes with 10 min breaks by blocking [distracting websites](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/57340528a6dfb3eb498dce647ed6841f) and apps.\n\n<img src="https://i.imgur.com/H7TMqgS.png" width="500" alt="img">\n\n<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5lLgPaU.png" width="500" alt="img">\n\n- If I go to any of my blocked websites during my `Focus` time, I am greeted with this message.\n\n<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JML4ywh.png" width="500" alt="img">\n\n#### [Annotate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/annotate-capture-screenshot/id918207447?mt=12) - Create and annotate screenshots\n\n- Best annotation tool I found to exist. After you make a screenshot, it allows for quick edits. Adding arrows, some text, blurring parts of the image as well as ability to quickly save the image or drag it to Dropzone to upload to Imgur to share the link quickly with anyone I want.\n\n#### [Popclip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) - iOS like mouse text selection popover\n\n- Another great utility I cannot live without, brings up a quick menu whenever some text is selected on which I can do a number of quick actions, like searching on Google, DuckDuckGo, YouTube, Dictionary, Reddit, Google Images or it can translate text selected, copy it or even make a SnippetsLab snippet from it.
