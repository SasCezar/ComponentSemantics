It is a wrapper around the APIs of React Native. So, with Vue Native, you can do everything that you can do with React Native. With Vue Native, you get\n\n- **The simplicity of Vue.js.** Incrementally build user interfaces with the familiar syntax of HTML and CSS in single file components.\n- **Seamless interop with React Native.** Use core React Native components with Vue.js syntax out of the box to develop mobile apps on both iOS and Android.\n\n## Contents\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Project setup with Vue Native CLI](#project-setup-with-vue-native-cli)\n- [Using Vue Native with a pre-existing React Native or Expo project](#using-vue-native-in-a-react-native-project)\n- [Deprecated React Native modules](#react-native-components-that-cant-be-used-out-of-the-box)\n- [Contributors](#contributors)\n- [Backers](#backers)\n- [Sponsors](#sponsors)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Special thanks](#credits-to-react-vue)\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find the full documentation for Vue Native [on this website](https://vue-native.io/docs/installation.html). It covers installation and setup, component basics, routing, testing, the internal API and more.\n\nThe source for the Vue Native documentation and website is hosted on a separate repo, [here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-website)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install Vue Native\'s official CLI, run\n```\n$ npm install vue-native-cli -g\n```\n\nTo use the CLI, you must have either [expo-cli](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli) or [react-native-cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) installed globally.\n\n## Project setup with Vue Native CLI\n\nThe Vue Native CLI can be used to easily generate a fully configured Vue Native app. It wraps `expo-cli` and `react-native-cli` to generate a simple single page application (SPA) after installing and configuring dependencies from [vue-native-core](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-core).\n\nYou should have either expo-cli or react-native-cli installed as a global dependency. Refer to the [installation guide](https://vue-native.io/docs/installation.html) for details on project setup. The GitHub repository for Vue Native CLI is hosted [here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-cli).\n\nWith the CLI, generating a Vue Native project is as easy as running the command\n```\n$ vue-native init <projectName>\n```\n\n## Using Vue Native in a React Native project\n\nIt is possible to integrate Vue Native into a pre-existing React Native project. You can find instructions to do this [here](converting-react-native-project.md).\n\nThese instructions can also be used to set up a Vue Native project from scratch.\n\n## React Native components that can\'t be used out of the box\n\nThe following modules are set to be removed from React Native in the future.\nHence these modules are no longer made available with Vue Native.\n- AlertIOS\n- AsyncStorage\n- ImageStore\n- ListView\n- MaskedViewIOS\n- NetInfo\n- Slider\n- SwipeableListView\n- ViewPagerAndroid\n- WebView\n\nIf you still wish to use them, you can import them explicitly from `react-native` (until they are removed) or from their individual forked packages.\nFor more information, refer to [this page](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2019/03/12/releasing-react-native-059#lean-core-is-underway).\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute. \n<a href="https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-core/contributors"><img src="https://opencollective.com/vue-native-core/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false" /></a>\n\n\n## Backers\n\nThank you to all our backers! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f [[Become a backer](https://opencollective.com/vue-native-core#backer)]\n\n<a href="https://opencollective.com/vue-native-core#backers" target="_blank"><img src="https://opencollective.com/vue-native-core/backers.svg?width=890"></a>\n\n\n## Sponsors\n\nSupport this project by becoming a sponsor.
