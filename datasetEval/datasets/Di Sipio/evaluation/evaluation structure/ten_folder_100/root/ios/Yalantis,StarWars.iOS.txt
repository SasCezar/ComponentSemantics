b'# StarWars Animation\n[![Platform](http://img.shields.io/badge/platform-iOS-blue.svg?style=flat)](http://cocoapods.org/?q=YALSideMenu) [![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Yalantis/Side-Menu.iOS/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\nThis component implements transition animation to crumble view-controller into tiny pieces.\n\n[![Yalantis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yalantis/PullToRefresh/develop/PullToRefreshDemo/Resources/badge_dark.png)](https://yalantis.com/?utm_source=github)\n\n![Preview](preview.gif)\n\nCheck this <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2109991-Star-Wars-App-concept">project on dribbble</a>.\n\nAlso, read how it was done in [our blog](https://yalantis.com/blog/uidynamics-uikit-or-opengl-3-types-of-ios-animations-for-the-star-wars/)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- iOS 8.0+\n- Xcode 8\n- Swift 4\n\n## Installing with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)\n\n```ruby\nuse_frameworks!\npod \'StarWars\', \'~> 2.0\'\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAt first, import StarWars:\n\n```swift\nimport StarWars\n```\n\nThen just implement class of *UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate* that will return our animation form method *animationControllerForDismissedController* and assign it to *transitioningDelegate* of viewController that you want to dismiss.\n\n```swift\noverride func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {\nlet destination = segue.destinationViewController\ndestination.transitioningDelegate = self\n}\n\nfunc animationControllerForDismissedController(dismissed: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {\nreturn StarWarsGLAnimator()\n}\n```\n\nThere are also two things you can customize in the Star Wars animation: duration and sprite sizes. \nLet\xe2\x80\x99s see how you can do this:\n\n```swift\nlet animator = StarWarsGLAnimator()\nanimator.duration = 2\nanimator.spriteWidth = 8\n```\n\nHave fun! :)\n\n#### Let us know!\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99d be really happy if you sent us links to your projects where you use our component. Just send an email to github@yalantis.com And do let us know if you have any questions or suggestion regarding the animation. \n\nP.S. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to publish more awesomeness wrapped in code and a tutorial on how to make UI for iOS (Android) better than better. Stay tuned!\n\n## Version history\n\n- `1.0` Swift 2.0\n- `2.0` Adds Swift 3.0 support\n- `3.0` Adds Swift 4.0 support\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2018 Yalantis\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
