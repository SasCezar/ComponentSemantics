As a developer you get notified of all the user interactions and get the beautiful UI for free, out of the box, it\'s just that simple.\n\n**ImagePicker** has been optimized to give a great user experience, it passes around referenced images instead of the image itself which makes it less memory consuming. This is what makes it smooth as butter.\n\n## Usage\n\n**ImagePicker** works as a normal controller, just instantiate it and present it.\n\n```swift\nlet imagePickerController = ImagePickerController()\nimagePickerController.delegate = self\npresent(imagePickerController, animated: true, completion: nil)\n```\n\n**ImagePicker** has three delegate methods that will inform you what the users are up to:\n\n```swift\nfunc wrapperDidPress(_ imagePicker: ImagePickerController, images: [UIImage])\nfunc doneButtonDidPress(_ imagePicker: ImagePickerController, images: [UIImage])\nfunc cancelButtonDidPress(_ imagePicker: ImagePickerController)\n```\n\n**ImagePicker** supports limiting the amount of images that can be selected, it defaults\nto zero, which means that the user can select as many images as he/she wants.\n\n```swift\nlet imagePickerController = ImagePickerController()\nimagePickerController.imageLimit = 5\n```\n\n### Optional bonus\n\n##### Configuration\n\nYou can inject `Configuration` instance to ImagePicker, which allows you to configure text, colors, fonts and camera features\n\n```swift\nvar configuration = Configuration()\nconfiguration.doneButtonTitle = "Finish"\nconfiguration.noImagesTitle = "Sorry! There are no images here!"\nconfiguration.recordLocation = false\n\nlet imagePicker = ImagePickerController(configuration: configuration)\n```\n\n##### Resolve assets\n\nAs said before, **ImagePicker** works with referenced images, that is really powerful because it lets you download the asset and choose the size you want. If you want to change the default implementation, just add a variable in your controller.\n\n```swift\npublic var imageAssets: [UIImage] {\n  return AssetManager.resolveAssets(imagePicker.stack.assets)\n}\n```\n\nAnd when you call any delegate method that returns images, add in the first line:\n\n```swift\nlet images = imageAssets\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n**ImagePicker** is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install\nit, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod \'ImagePicker\'\n```\n\n**ImagePicker** is also available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).\nTo install just write into your Cartfile:\n\n```ruby\ngithub "hyperoslo/ImagePicker"\n```\n\n## Author\n\n[Hyper](http://hyper.no) made this with \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\n\n## Contribute\n\nWe would love you to contribute to **ImagePicker**, check the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/hyperoslo/ImagePicker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more info.\n\n## License\n\n**ImagePicker** is available under the MIT license.
