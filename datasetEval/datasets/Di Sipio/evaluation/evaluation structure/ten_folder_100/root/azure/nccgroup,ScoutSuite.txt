Using the APIs exposed by cloud providers, Scout Suite gathers configuration data for manual inspection \nand highlights risk areas. Rather than going through dozens of pages on the web consoles, Scout Suite presents a clear \nview of the attack surface automatically.\n\nScout Suite is stable and actively maintained, but a number of features and internals may change. As such, please bear\nwith us as we find time to work on, and improve, the tool. Feel free to report a bug with details (please provide\nconsole output using the `--debug` argument), request a new feature, or send a pull request.\n\nThe project team can be contacted at <scoutsuite@nccgroup.com>.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThe latest (and final) version of Scout2 can be found in <https://github.com/nccgroup/Scout2/releases> and\n<https://pypi.org/project/AWSScout2>. Further work is not planned for Scout2. Fixes will be implemented in Scout Suite.\n\n### Support\n\nThe following cloud providers are currently supported/planned:\n\n- Amazon Web Services\n- Microsoft Azure\n- Google Cloud Platform\n- Alibaba Cloud (alpha)\n- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (alpha)\n\n### Installation\n\nRefer to the [wiki](https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite/wiki/Setup).\n\n## Compliance\n\n### AWS\n\nUse of Scout Suite does not require AWS users to complete and submit the AWS Vulnerability / Penetration Testing\nRequest Form. Scout Suite only performs API calls to fetch configuration data and identify security gaps, which is not\nconsidered security scanning as it does not impact AWS\' network and applications.\n\n### Azure\n\nUse of Scout Suite does not require Azure users to contact Microsoft to begin testing. The only requirement is that\nusers abide by the Microsoft Cloud Unified Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement.\n\nReferences:\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-pen-testing\n- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement\n\n### Google Cloud Platform\n\nUse of Scout Suite does not require GCP users to contact Google to begin testing. The only requirement is that users\nabide by the Cloud Platform Acceptable Use Policy and the Terms of Service and ensure that tests only affect projects\nyou own (and not other customers\' applications).\n\nReferences:\n- https://cloud.google.com/terms/aup\n- https://cloud.google.com/terms/\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following command will provide the list of available command line options:\n\n    $ python scout.py --help\n\nYou can also use this to get help on a specific provider:\n\n    $ python scout.py PROVIDER --help\n\nFor further details, checkout our Wiki pages at <https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite/wiki>.\n\nAfter performing a number of API calls, Scout will create a local HTML report and open it in the default browser.\n\nAlso note that the command line will try to infer the argument name if possible when receiving partial switch. For\nexample, this will work and use the selected profile:\n\n    $ python scout.py aws --profile PROFILE\n\n### Credentials\n\nAssuming you already have your provider\'s CLI up and running you should have your credentials already set up and be able to run Scout Suite by using one of the following commands. If that is not the case, please consult the wiki page for the provider desired.\n\n#### [Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite/wiki/Amazon-Web-Services)\n\n    $ python scout.py aws\n\n#### [Azure](https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite/wiki/Azure)\n\n    $ python scout.py azure --cli\n\n#### [Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite/wiki/Google-Cloud-Platform)\n\n    $ python scout.py gcp --user-account\n\nAdditional information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite/wiki).'
