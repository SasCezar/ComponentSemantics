b"# Azure IoT Hub Python SDKs v2 - PREVIEW\n\n![Build Status](https://azure-iot-sdks.visualstudio.com/azure-iot-sdks/_apis/build/status/Azure.azure-iot-sdk-python)\n\nThis repository contains code for the Azure IoT SDKs for Python.  This enables python developers to easily create IoT device solutions that semealessly\nconnection to the Azure IoTHub ecosystem.\n\n*If you're looking for the v1.x.x client library, it is now preserved in the [v1-deprecated](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/tree/v1-deprecated) branch.*\n\n**Note that these SDKs are currently in preview, and are subject to change.**\n\n## Azure IoT SDK for Python\n\nThis repository contains the following libraries:\n\n* [Azure IoT Device library](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/master/azure-iot-device/README.md)\n\n* [Azure IoT Hub Service library](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/master/azure-iot-hub/README.md)\n\n* Coming Soon: Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service Library\n\n## Installing the libraries\n\nPip installs are provided for all of the SDK libraries in this repo:\n\n[Device libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/tree/master/azure-iot-device#installation)\n\n[IoTHub library](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/master/azure-iot-hub/README.md#installation)\n\n## Features\n\n:heavy_check_mark: feature available  :heavy_multiplication_x: feature planned but not yet supported  :heavy_minus_sign: no support planned*\n\n*Features that are not planned may be prioritized in a future release, but are not currently planned\n\n### Device Client Library ([azure-iot-device](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/tree/master/azure-iot-device))\n\n#### IoTHub Device Client\n\n| Features                                                                                                         | Status                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-security-deployment)                     | :heavy_check_mark:         | Connect your device to IoT Hub securely with supported authentication, including private key, SASToken, X-509 Self Signed and Certificate Authority (CA) Signed.                                                     |\n| [Send device-to-cloud message](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c)     | :heavy_check_mark:         | Send device-to-cloud messages (max 256KB) to IoT Hub with the option to add custom properties.                                                                                                                       |\n| [Receive cloud-to-device messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-c2d) | :heavy_check_mark:         | Receive cloud-to-device messages and read associated custom and system properties from IoT Hub, with the option to complete/reject/abandon C2D messages.                                                             |\n| [Device Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins)                     | :heavy_check_mark:         | IoT Hub persists a device twin for each device that you connect to IoT Hub.
