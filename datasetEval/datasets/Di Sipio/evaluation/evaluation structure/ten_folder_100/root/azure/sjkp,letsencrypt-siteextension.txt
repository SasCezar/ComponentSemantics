b'# Let\'s Encrypt Site Extension\n[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/_apis/build/status/letsencrypt-siteextension.core)](https://dev.azure.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/_build/latest?definitionId=1) [![Build status](https://dockerbuildbadges.quelltext.eu/status.svg?organization=sjkp&repository=letsencrypt-azure)](https://hub.docker.com/r/sjkp/letsencrypt-azure/)\n\nThis Azure Web App Site Extension enables easy installation and configuration of [Let\'s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) issued SSL certificates for you custom domain names. \n\nThe site extension requires that you have configured a DNS entry for your custom domain to point to Azure Web App. \n\nNovember 2019 - Microsoft finally acknowledge that maybe it is in due time that they add first level support for free SSL certificates, see this announcement about [App Service Managed Certificates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/secure-your-custom-domains-at-no-cost-with-app-service-managed-certificates-preview/), be aware that it is in preview and currently **doesn\'t support** the apex/naked domain. \n\n## How to install\nhttps://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension/wiki/How-to-install\n\n## Known Issues\n* This site-extension is **NOT** supported by Microsoft it is my own work based on https://github.com/ebekker/ACMESharp and https://github.com/Lone-Coder/letsencrypt-win-simple - this means don\'t expect 24x7 support, I use it for several of my own smaller sites, but if you are running sites that are important you should consider spending the few $ on a certificate and go with a Microsoft supported way of enabling SSL, so you have someone to blame :) \n* Note that Let\'s Encrypt works by providing automated certificates of a short (currently three month) duration. This extension is BETA SOFTWARE. You will need to keep this extension updated or risk losing SSL access when your certificate expires.\n* There are presently no email notifications for certificate renewal problems, but Lets Encrypt will email you weeks in advance of certificate expiration, when the extension is running properly the certificate should have been renewed before Let\'s Encrypt send the reminder email.\n* Due to rate limiting of Let\'s Encrypt servers, you can only request five certificates per domain name per week. Configuration errors or errors in this site extension may render you unable to retrieve a new certificate for seven days. If up-time is critical, have a plan for deploying a SSL certificate from another source in place.\n* No support for multi-region web apps, so if you use traffic manager or some other load balancer to route traffic between web apps in different regions please dont use this extension. \n* If you publish your project from Visual Studio with the "Delete Existing files" option, you will remove the web jobs the site extension uses to renew the certificate once they expire every 3 months (you can renew them manually or install the site extension again after publish). \n* The site-extension can now work with [Azure App Service Local Cache](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-local-cache/), however you must do a little manual work, see https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension/wiki/Azure-Function,-Multi-Region,-Local-Cache-support\n* If you use the "Run From Zip" deployment method, please take a look at this: https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension/issues/239#issuecomment-440785470 \n\n## How to troubleshoot\nhttps://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension/wiki/Troubleshoot\n\n## This is Beta Software\nPlease take note that this Site-Extension is beta-software, so use at your own risk.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Defaults to false, which results in SNI. \n| letsencrypt:RenewXNumberOfDaysBeforeExpiration | Set to an integer defining the number of days before expiration the certificates should be renewed. Defaults to 22 days before expiration, as letencrypt sends reminder emails 20 days before\n| letsencrypt:AuthorizationChallengeBlobStorageAccount | (Optional) Set this setting to the connection string of a storage account, if you want to persist the http challenge file to an external azure blob storage, and serve it yourself when let\'s encrypt request it from the http://yourdomain/.well-known/acme-challenge/{filename} path. (Can be used when local file system cache is enabled or the web app is deployed to multiple region behind traffic manager etc.)\n| letsencrypt:AuthorizationChallengeBlobStorageContainer | Used in conjuction with letsencrypt:AuthorizationChallengeBlobStorageAccount if you want to specify the name of the container that is used, if not specified then letsencrypt-siteextension is used\n\nAs it can be seen from the list of App Settings a service principal is needed. The service principal must be assigned permissions to the web app, that is required as the extension use it for installing and updating the certificate. (If two resource groups are used, the app service principal must have access to both). \n\nBesides the App Settings, the two Azure Web Job required connection strings ```AzureWebJobsStorage``` and ```AzureWebJobsDashboard``` must also exists, as the extension relies on an internal Web Job to renew the certificates once they expire. \n\nTo see an example of an ARM template installation look at [azuredeploy.json](LetsEncrypt.ResourceGroup/Templates/azuredeploy.json)\n'
