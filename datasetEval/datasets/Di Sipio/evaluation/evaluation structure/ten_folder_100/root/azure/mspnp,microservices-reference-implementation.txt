b"# Microservices Reference Implementation\nMicrosoft patterns & practices\n\nThis reference implementation shows a set of best practices for building and running a microservices architecture on Microsoft Azure, using Kubernetes.\n\n## Guidance\n\nThis project has a companion set of articles that describe challenges, design patterns, and best practices for building microservices architecture. You can find these articles on the Azure Architecture Center:\n\n- [Designing, building, and operating microservices on Azure with Kubernetes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/microservices)\n\n## Scenario\n\n\xe2\x80\x8bFabrikam, Inc. (a fictional company) is starting a drone delivery service. The company manages a fleet of drone aircraft. Businesses register with the service, and users can request a drone to pick up goods for delivery. When a customer schedules a pickup, a backend system assigns a drone and notifies the user with an estimated delivery time. While the delivery is in progress, the customer can track the location of the drone, with a continuously updated ETA.\n\n## The Drone Delivery app\n\nThe Drone Delivery application is a sample application that consists of several microservices. Because it's a sample, the functionality is simulated, but the APIs and microservices interactions are intended to reflect real-world design patterns.\n\n- Ingestion service. Receives client requests and buffers them.\n- Scheduler service. Dispatches client requests and manages the delivery workflow.\n- Supervisor service. Monitors the workflow for failures and applies compensating transactions.\n- Account service. Manages user accounts.\n- Third-party Transportation service. Manages third-party transportation options.\n- Drone service. Schedules drones and monitors drones in flight.\n- Package service. Manages packages.\n- Delivery service. Manages deliveries that are scheduled or in-transit.\n- Delivery History service. Stores the history of completed deliveries.\n\n![](./architecture.png)\n\n## Test results and metrics\nThe Drone Delivery application has been tested up to 2000 messages/sec:\n\n\n|                                          | Replicas | ~Max CPU (mc) | ~Max Mem (MB) | Avg.
