Different authentication methods are available and not all require SHA-256.\n- **Have a Real Time Clock or implement code to connect to an NTP server**: necessary for both establishing the TLS connection and generating the secure token for authentication.\n- **Having at least 64KB of RAM**: the memory footprint of the SDK depends on the SDK and protocol used as well as the platform targeted. The smallest footprint is achieved targeting microcontrollers.\n- **Having at least 4KB of RAM set for incoming SSL max content length buffer**: For some TLS libraries, this may be a configurable option and default may have been set as **4KB** for low memory footprint devices. During TLS handshake, IoT Hub service will send Server Hello which includes IoT Hub server side certificates as part of Server Hello payload. \nDuring **renewal** of these IoT Hub server side certificates, check will be made on IoT Hub service side to prevent **Server Hello** exceeding 4KB limit so that existing devices which are set for 4KB limit continue to work as before after certificate renewals.\n\nPlatform support details can be found in [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-device-sdk-platform-support).\nYou can find an exhaustive list of the OS platforms the various SDKs have been tested against in the [Azure Certified for IoT device catalog](https://catalog.azureiotsuite.com/). Note that you might still be able to use the SDKs on OS and hardware platforms that are not listed on this page: all the SDKs are open sourced and designed to be portable. If you have suggestions, feedback or issues to report, refer to the Contribution and Support sections below.\n\n## Porting the Azure IoT Device Client SDK for C to New Devices\n\nThe C SDKs and Libraries:\n* Are written in ANSI C (C99) and avoids compiler extensions to maximize code portability and broad platform compatibility.\n* Expose a platform abstraction layer to isolate OS dependencies (threading and mutual exclusion mechanisms, communications protocol e.g. HTTP). Refer to our [porting guide][c-porting-guide] for more information about our abstraction layer.\n\nIn the repository you will find instructions and build tools to compile and run the device client SDK for C on Linux, Windows and microcontroller platforms (refer to the links above for more information on compiling the device client for C).\n\nIf you are considering porting the device client SDK for C to a new platform, check out the [porting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-c-shared-utility/blob/master/devdoc/porting_guide.md) document.\n\n## Contribution, Feedback and Issues\n\nIf you encounter any bugs, have suggestions for new features or if you would like to become an active contributor to this project please follow the instructions provided in the [contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Support\n* Have a feature request for SDKs?

The lifetime of an LTS branch is currently planned for one year. LTS branches receive all bug fixes that fall in one of these categories:\n\n- security bugfixes\n- critical bugfixes\n\nNo new features will be picked up in an LTS branch.\n\nLTS branches are named lts_*mm*_*yyyy*, where *mm* and *yyyy* are the month and year when the branch was created. An example of such a branch is *lts_07_2017*.\n\n## Schedule<sup>1</sup>\n\nBelow is a table showing the mapping of the LTS branches to the packages released\n\n| Package | Github Branch | LTS Status | LTS Start Date | Maintenance End Date | Removed Date |\n| :-----------: | :-----------: | :--------: | :------------: | :------------------: | :----------: |\n| Vcpkg: 2019-07-01.1<br/> Xenial: 0.2.0.0-21xenial<br/> Trusty: 0.2.0-21trusty<br/> Bionic: 0.2.0.0-14bionic<br/>    | lts_07_2019   | Active     | 2019-07-01     | 2020-07-01           | 2020-07-01   |\n| Vcpkg: 1.2.14-1<br/> Xenial: 0.2.0.0-16xenial<br/> Trusty: 0.2.0-16trusty<br/> Bionic: 0.2.0.0-9bionic<br/>    | lts_01_2019   | Active     | 2019-01-31     | 2020-01-31           | 2020-01-31   |\n| Nuget: 1.2.10<br/> Xenial: 0.2.0.0-12xenial<br/> Trusty: 0.2.0-12trusty<br/> Bionic: 0.2.0.0-5bionic<br/>    | lts_10_2018   | Active     | 2018-10-03     | 2019-10-03           | 2019-10-03   |\n\n* <sup>1</sup> All scheduled dates are subject to change by the Azure IoT SDK team.\n\n### Planned Release Schedule\n![](./lts_branches.png)\n\n---\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
