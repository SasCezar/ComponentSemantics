It has simple, functional style API, heavily inspired by Greg Young\'s Event Store.\n\n## Features\n\n+ Fully ACID compliant\n+ Optimistic concurrency support\n+ Duplicate event detection (based on identity)\n+ Automatic continuation for both writes and reads (over WATS limits)\n+ Custom stream and event properties you can query on\n+ Synchronous (inline) projections and snapshots\n+ Change tracking support for inline projections\n+ Friendly for multi-tenant designs\n+ Sharding support (jump consistent hashing)\n+ Compatible with .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.6\n\n## Installing from NuGet [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Streamstone.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Streamstone/)\n\nTo install Streamstone via NuGet, run this command in NuGet package manager console:\n\n    PM> Install-Package Streamstone\n\n## Building from source [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3rsmwblor11b6inq/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/yevhen/streamstone/branch/master)\n\nTo build Streamstone binaries on Windows you will need to have Visual Studio 17 Update 3 or higher and .NET Core SDK 2.0 or higher. To build binaries on Linux use dotnet cli tooling (ie `dotnet build`). \n\n## Running unit tests\n\nUnit tests require Azure Storage Emulator 5.2 or higher, which is currently available only on Windows. Alternatively, you could run against real Azure by setting storage account connection string to **Streamstone-Test-Storage** user-level environment variable.\n\n## Design\n\nStreamstone is just a thin layer (library, not a server) on top of Windows Azure Table Storage. It implements low-level mechanics for dealing with event streams, and all heavy-weight lifting is done by underlying provider. \n\nThe api is stateless and all exposed objects are immutable, once fully constructed. Streamstone doesn\'t dictate payload serialization protocol, so you are free to choose any protocol you want.\n\nOptimistic concurrency is implemented by always including stream header entity with every write, making it impossible to append to a stream without first having a latest Etag. Duplicate event detection is done by automatically creating additional entity for every event, with RowKey value set to a unique identifier of a source event (consistent secondary index).     \n\n## Schema\n\n<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yevhen/Streamstone/master/Doc/Schema.png" target="_blank" title="Click to view full size"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yevhen/Streamstone/master/Doc/Schema.png" alt="Schema" style="max-width:100%;"/></a>\n\n---\n\n<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yevhen/Streamstone/master/Doc/Schema_VP.png" target="_blank" title="Click to view full size"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yevhen/Streamstone/master/Doc/Schema_VP.png" alt="Schema for virtual partitions" style="max-width:100%;"/></a>\n\n## Usage\n\n##### Essentials\n+ Provisioning stream [[see](/Source/Example/Scenarios/S01_Provision_new_stream.cs)]\n+ Opening stream [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S02_Open_stream_for_writing.cs)]\n+ Writing to stream [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S04_Write_to_stream.cs)]\n+ Reading from stream [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S05_Read_from_stream.cs)]\n+ Additional entity includes [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S06_Include_additional_entities.cs)]\n+ Optimistic concurrency [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S08_Concurrency_conflicts.cs)]\n+ Handling duplicate events [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S09_Handling_duplicates.cs)]\n+ Custom stream metadata [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S07_Custom_stream_metadata.cs)]\n+ Virtual partitions [[see](Source/Streamstone.Tests/Scenarios/Virtual_partitions.cs)]\n\n##### Application\n+ Implementing stream directory [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S10_Stream_directory.cs)]\n+ Using snapshots [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S06_Include_additional_entities.cs)]\n+ Creating projections [[see]()]\n+ Querying events [[see]()]\n\n##### Demo\n+ Classic Greg Young\'s CQRS demo using Streamstone [[repo](https://github.com/yevhen/Streamstone.m-r)]\n+ Using Streamstone in stateful applications.
