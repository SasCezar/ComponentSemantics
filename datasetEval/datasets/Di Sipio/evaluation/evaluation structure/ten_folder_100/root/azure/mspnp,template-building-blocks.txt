Versions earlier than 2.0.4 will no longer function. Please upgrade to version 2.0.4 or greater to continue using Azure Building Blocks. \n\nThe Azure Building Blocks project is a command line tool and set of Azure Resource Manager templates designed to simplify deployment of Azure resources. Users author a set of simplified parameters to specify settings for Azure resources, and the command line tool merges these parameters with best practice defaults to produce a set of final parameter files that can be deployed with the Azure Resource Manager templates.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nInstall the Azure Building Blocks using npm:\n\n```\nnpm install -g @mspnp/azure-building-blocks\n```\n\nVerify the version of azure building blocks you are running using the command below. Make sure you are running version 2.0.4 or later.\n\n```\nazbb -V\n```\n\nThen, [author an Azure Building Blocks parameter file](https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki/create-a-template-building-blocks-parameter-file) and [run the `azbb` command line tool](https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki/command-line-reference).\n\n# Documentation\n\nFull documentation for the command line tool and parameter file schema is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki).\n\n# Examples\n\nAzure Building Blocks parameters to deploy three identical VMs:\n\n```json\n"type": "VirtualMachine",\n"settings": {\n    "vmCount": 3,\n    "osType": "windows",\n    "namePrefix": "test",\n    "adminPassword": "testPassw0rd!23",\n    "nics": [{"subnetName": "web"}],\n    "virtualNetwork": {"name": "ra-vnet"}\n}\n```\n\nThe command line tool merges best practice defaults to the parameters as follows:\n\n-\tEnables diagnostics on all VMs\n-\tDeploys the VMs in an availability set \n-\tAll VM disks are managed\n-\tOS is latest Windows Server 2016 image\n-\tPublic IP created for each VM\n\nTo add a scaleset with three identical VMs:\n\n```json\n"type": "VirtualMachine",\n"settings": {\n    "vmCount": 3,\n    "osType": "windows",\n    "namePrefix": "test",\n    "adminPassword": "testPassw0rd!23",\n    "nics": [{\n        "subnetName": "web",\n        "isPublic": false\n        }],\n    "virtualNetwork": {"name": "ra-vnet"},\n    "scaleSetSettings": { }\n}\n```\n\n# Version history\n\nThe list below shows changes introduced with the latest versions.\n\n## 2.0.4\n\n- Fixed minor bugs\n- Introduced a more rigorous versioning scheme\n\n## 2.1.1\n\n- Introduced breaking changes to versions less than 2.0.4\n- Added standalone load balancer building block\n- Added standalone application gateway building block\n- Changes to VM building block to allow use of pre-existing load balancer and application gateway\n- Added support for \'single-step\' disk encryption to VM building block\n\n## 2.1.2\n\n- Fixed bug on internal load balancer\n- Added support for \'custom data\' to VM building block\n\n## 2.2.0\n\n- Added support for Availability Zones and Standard SKU for Load Balancers, Application Gateways, and Public IP Addresses\n- Added support for Availability Zones for virtual machines\n- Added deployment script generation\n- Added NodeJS 10.16.2+ requirement\n\n## 2.2.1\n- Added missing subscription parameter\n\n## 2.2.2\n- Fixed AZ CLI parameter issues\n\n## 2.2.3\n- Fixed Azure Cloud Shell incompatibility\n\n# License\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
