If you are looking to upgrade to the new version of the SDK, please see the [Upgrade Guide](#upgrading-from-the-old-version-of-application-insights).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Create an Application Insights resource in Azure by following [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-javascript?toc=/azure/azure-monitor/toc.json).\n2. Grab the _Instrumentation Key_ (aka "ikey") from the resource you created in\n   step 1. Later, you\'ll add it to the `instrumentationKey` setting of the Application Insights JavaScript SDK.\n3. Add Application Insights to your app. **There are 2 ways to do this.**\n    - Install via NPM. Then, [set up an instance of Application Insights in your app.](#npm-setup-ignore-if-using-snippet-setup)\n        > *Note:* **Typings are included with this package**, so you do **not** need to install a separate typings package.\n\n        ```sh\n        npm i --save @microsoft/applicationinsights-web\n        ```\n\n    - [Pasting a script snippet at the beginning of every `<head>` tag for each page you want to monitor.](#snippet-setup-(ignore-if-using-npm-setup))\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### NPM Setup (ignore if using Snippet Setup)\n\n```js\nimport { ApplicationInsights } from \'@microsoft/applicationinsights-web\'\n\nconst appInsights = new ApplicationInsights({ config: {\n  instrumentationKey: \'YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY_GOES_HERE\'\n  /* ...Other Configuration Options... */\n} });\nappInsights.loadAppInsights();\nappInsights.trackPageView(); // Manually call trackPageView to establish the current user/session/pageview\n```\n\n### Snippet Setup (Ignore if using NPM Setup)\n\nIf your app does not use NPM, you can directly instrument your webpages with Application Insights by pasting this snippet at the top of each your pages. Preferably, it should be the first script in your `<head>` section so that it can monitor any potential issues with all of your dependencies.\n\n```html\n<script type="text/javascript">\nvar sdkInstance="appInsightsSDK";window[sdkInstance]="appInsights";var aiName=window[sdkInstance],aisdk=window[aiName]||function(e){function n(e){t[e]=function(){var n=arguments;t.queue.push(function(){t[e].apply(t,n)})}}var t={config:e};t.initialize=!0;var i=document,a=window;setTimeout(function(){var n=i.createElement("script");n.src=e.url||"https://az416426.vo.msecnd.net/scripts/b/ai.2.min.js",i.getElementsByTagName("script")[0].parentNode.appendChild(n)});try{t.cookie=i.cookie}catch(e){}t.queue=[],t.version=2;for(var r=["Event","PageView","Exception","Trace","DependencyData","Metric","PageViewPerformance"];r.length;)n("track"+r.pop());n("startTrackPage"),n("stopTrackPage");var s="Track"+r[0];if(n("start"+s),n("stop"+s),n("addTelemetryInitializer"),n("setAuthenticatedUserContext"),n("clearAuthenticatedUserContext"),n("flush"),t.SeverityLevel={Verbose:0,Information:1,Warning:2,Error:3,Critical:4},!(!0===e.disableExceptionTracking||e.extensionConfig&&e.extensionConfig.ApplicationInsightsAnalytics&&!0===e.extensionConfig.ApplicationInsightsAnalytics.disableExceptionTracking)){n("_"+(r="onerror"));var o=a[r];a[r]=function(e,n,i,a,s){var c=o&&o(e,n,i,a,s);return!0!==c&&t["_"+r]({message:e,url:n,lineNumber:i,columnNumber:a,error:s}),c},e.autoExceptionInstrumented=!0}return t}(\n{\n  instrumentationKey:"INSTRUMENTATION_KEY"\n}\n);window[aiName]=aisdk,aisdk.queue&&0===aisdk.queue.length&&aisdk.trackPageView({});\n</script>\n```\n\n### Connection String Setup\n\nFor either the NPM or Snippet setup, you can also configure your instance of Application Insights using a Connection String. Simply replace the `instrumentationKey` field with the `connectionString` field.\n```js\nimport { ApplicationInsights } from \'@microsoft/applicationinsights-web\'\n\nconst appInsights = new ApplicationInsights({ config: {\n  connectionString: \'YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING_GOES_HERE\'\n  /* ...Other Configuration Options... */\n} });\nappInsights.loadAppInsights();\nappInsights.trackPageView();\n```\n\n### Sending Telemetry to the Azure Portal\n\nIf initialized using the snippet, your Application Insights instance is located by default at `window.appInsights`\n\n```js\nappInsights.trackEvent({name: \'some event\'});\nappInsights.trackPageView({name: \'some page\'});\nappInsights.trackPageViewPerformance({name : \'some page\', url: \'some url\'});\nappInsights.trackException({exception: new Error(\'some error\')});\nappInsights.trackTrace({message: \'some trace\'});\nappInsights.trackMetric({name: \'some metric\', average: 42});\nappInsights.trackDependencyData({absoluteUrl: \'some url\', responseCode: 200, method: \'GET\', id: \'some id\'});\nappInsights.startTrackPage("pageName");\nappInsights.stopTrackPage("pageName", {customProp1: "some value"});\nappInsights.startTrackEvent("event");\nappInsights.stopTrackEvent("event", {customProp1: "some value"});\nappInsights.flush();\n```\n\n### Setting Up Autocollection\n\nAll autocollection is ON by default. The full version of the Application Insights Javascript SDK auto collects:\n\n- **Uncaught exceptions** in your app, including information on\n  - Stack trace\n  - Exception details and message accompanying the error\n  - Line & column number of error\n  - URL where error was raised\n- **Network Dependency Requests** made by your app **XHR** and **Fetch** (fetch collection is disabled by default) requests, include information on\n  - Url of dependency source\n  - Command & Method used to request the dependency\n  - Duration of the request\n  - Result code and success status of the request\n  - ID (if any) of user making the request\n  - Correlation context (if any) where request is made\n- **User information** (e.g. Location, network, IP)\n- **Device information** (e.g. Browser, OS, version, language, resolution, model)\n- **Session information**\n\n### Telemetry Initializers\n\nTelemetry initializers are used to modify the contents of collected telemetry before being sent from the user\'s browser. They can also be used to prevent certain telemetry from being sent, by returning `false`. Multiple telemetry initializers can be added to your Application Insights instance, and they are executed in order of adding them.\n\nThe input argument to `addTelemetryInitializer` is a callback that takes a [`ITelemetryItem`](./API-reference.md#addTelemetryInitializer) as an argument and returns a `boolean` or `void`. If returning `false`, the telemetry item is not sent, else it proceeds to the next telemetry initializer, if any, or is sent to the telemetry collection endpoint.\n\nAn example of using telemetry initializers:\n\n```js\nvar telemetryInitializer = (envelope) => {\n  envelope.data.someField = \'This item passed through my telemetry initializer\';\n};\nappInsights.addTelemetryInitializer(telemetryInitializer);\nappInsights.trackTrace({message: \'This message will use a telemetry initializer\'});\n\nappInsights.addTelemetryInitializer(() => false); // Nothing is sent after this is executed\nappInsights.trackTrace({message: \'this message will not be sent\'}); // Not sent\n```\n\n#### Example: (Setting Cloud Role Name)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-map#set-cloud-role-name]\n```js\nvar telemetryInitializer = (envelope) => {\n  envelope.tags["ai.cloud.role"] = "your role name";\n  envelope.tags["ai.cloud.roleInstance"] = "your role instance";\n}\nappInsights.addTelemetryInitializer(telemetryInitializer);\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nMost configuration fields are named such that they can be defaulted to falsey. All fields are optional except for `instrumentationKey`.\n\n| Name | Default | Description |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| instrumentationKey | null | **Required**<br>Instrumentation key that you obtained from the Azure Portal. |\n| accountId | null | An optional account id, if your app groups users into accounts. No spaces, commas, semicolons, equals, or vertical bars |\n| sessionRenewalMs | 1800000 | A session is logged if the user is inactive for this amount of time in milliseconds. Default is 30 minutes |\n| sessionExpirationMs | 86400000 | A session is logged if it has continued for this amount of time in milliseconds. Default is 24 hours |\n| maxBatchSizeInBytes | 10000 | Max size of telemetry batch. If a batch exceeds this limit, it is immediately sent and a new batch is started |\n| maxBatchInterval | 15000 | How long to batch telemetry for before sending (milliseconds) |\n| disableExceptionTracking | false | If true, exceptions are no autocollected. Default is false. |\n| disableTelemetry | false | If true, telemetry is not collected or sent. Default is false. |\n| enableDebug | false | If true, **internal** debugging data is thrown as an exception **instead** of being logged, regardless of SDK logging settings. Default is false. <br>***Note:*** Enabling this setting will result in dropped telemetry whenever an internal error occurs. This can be useful for quickly identifying issues with your configuration or usage of the SDK. If you do not want to lose telemetry while debugging, consider using `consoleLoggingLevel` or `telemetryLoggingLevel` instead of `enableDebug`. |\n| loggingLevelConsole | 0 | Logs **internal** Application Insights errors to console. <br>0: off, <br>1: Critical errors only, <br>2: Everything (errors & warnings) |\n| loggingLevelTelemetry | 1 | Sends **internal** Application Insights errors as telemetry. <br>0: off, <br>1: Critical errors only, <br>2: Everything (errors & warnings) |\n| diagnosticLogInterval | 10000 | (internal) Polling interval (in ms) for internal logging queue |\n| samplingPercentage | 100 | Percentage of events that will be sent. Default is 100, meaning all events are sent. Set this if you wish to preserve your datacap for large-scale applications. |\n| autoTrackPageVisitTime | false | If true, on a pageview,the previous instrumented page\'s view time is tracked and sent as telemetry and a new timer is started for the current pageview. Default is false. |\n| disableAjaxTracking | false | If true, Ajax calls are not autocollected. Default is false. |\n| disableFetchTracking | true | If true, Fetch requests are not autocollected. Default is true |\n| overridePageViewDuration | false | If true, default behavior of trackPageView is changed to record end of page view duration interval when trackPageView is called. If false and no custom duration is provided to trackPageView, the page view performance is calculated using the navigation timing API. Default is false. |\n| maxAjaxCallsPerView | 500 | Default 500 - controls how many ajax calls will be monitored per page view. Set to -1 to monitor all (unlimited) ajax calls on the page. |\n| disableDataLossAnalysis | true | If false, internal telemetry sender buffers will be checked at startup for items not yet sent. |\n| disableCorrelationHeaders | false | If false, the SDK will add two headers (\'Request-Id\' and \'Request-Context\') to all dependency requests to correlate them with corresponding requests on the server side. Default is false. |\n| correlationHeaderExcludedDomains |  | Disable correlation headers for specific domains |\n| correlationHeaderDomains |  | Enable correlation headers for specific domains |\n| disableFlushOnBeforeUnload | false | Default false. If true, flush method will not be called when onBeforeUnload event triggers |\n| enableSessionStorageBuffer | true | Default true. If true, the buffer with all unsent telemetry is stored in session storage. The buffer is restored on page load |\n| isCookieUseDisabled | false | Default false. If true, the SDK will not store or read any data from cookies.|\n| cookieDomain | null | Custom cookie domain. This is helpful if you want to share Application Insights cookies across subdomains. |\n| isRetryDisabled | false | Default false. If false, retry on 206 (partial success), 408 (timeout), 429 (too many requests), 500 (internal server error), 503 (service unavailable), and 0 (offline, only if detected) |\n| isStorageUseDisabled | false | If true, the SDK will not store or read any data from local and session storage. Default is false. |\n| isBeaconApiDisabled | true | If false, the SDK will send all telemetry using the [Beacon API](https://www.w3.org/TR/beacon) |\n| onunloadDisableBeacon | false | Default false. when tab is closed, the SDK will send all remaining telemetry using the [Beacon API](https://www.w3.org/TR/beacon) |\n| sdkExtension | null | Sets the sdk extension name. Only alphabetic characters are allowed. The extension name is added as a prefix to the \'ai.internal.sdkVersion\' tag (e.g. \'ext_javascript:2.0.0\'). Default is null. |\n| isBrowserLinkTrackingEnabled | false | Default is false. If true, the SDK will track all [Browser Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/using-browserlink) requests. |\n| appId | null | AppId is used for the correlation between AJAX dependencies happening on the client-side with the server-side requests. When Beacon API is enabled, it cannot be used automatically, but can be set manually in the configuration. Default is null |\n| enableCorsCorrelation | false | If true, the SDK will add two headers (\'Request-Id\' and \'Request-Context\') to all CORS requests tocorrelate outgoing AJAX dependencies with corresponding requests on the server side. Default is false |\n| namePrefix | undefined | An optional value that will be used as name postfix for localStorage and cookie name.\n| enableAutoRouteTracking | false | Automatically track route changes in Single Page Applications (SPA). If true, each route change will send a new Pageview to Application Insights. Hash route changes changes (`example.com/foo#bar`) are also recorded as new page views.\n| enableRequestHeaderTracking | false | If true, AJAX & Fetch request headers is tracked, default is false.\n| enableResponseHeaderTracking | false | If true, AJAX & Fetch request\'s response headers is tracked, default is false.\n| distributedTracingMode | `DistributedTracingModes.AI` | Sets the distributed tracing mode. If AI_AND_W3C mode or W3C mode is set, W3C trace context headers (traceparent/tracestate) will be generated and included in all outgoing requests. AI_AND_W3C is provided for back-compatibility with any legacy Application Insights instrumented services.\n\n## Single Page Applications\n\nBy default, this SDK will **not** handle state based route changing that occurs in single page applications. To enable automatic route change tracking for your single page application, you can add `enableAutoRouteTracking: true` to your setup configuration.\n\nCurrently, we support a separate [React plugin](#available-extensions-for-the-sdk) which you can initialize with this SDK. It will also accomplish route change tracking for you, as well as collect [other React specific telemetry](./extensions/applicationinsights-react-js).\n\n## Source Map Support\n\nThe minified callstack of your exception telemetry can be unminified in the Azure Portal. All existing integrations on the Exception Details panel will work with the newly unminified callstack. Drag and drop source map unminifying supports all existing and future JS SDKs (+Node.JS), so you do not need to upgrade your SDK version. To view your unminified callstack,\n1. Select an Exception Telemetry item in the Azure Portal to view its "End-to-end transaction details"\n2. Identify which source maps correspond to this call stack. The source map must match a stack frame\'s source file, but suffixed with `.map`\n3. Drag and drop the source maps onto the call stack in the Azure Portal\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Efue9nU.gif)\n\n## Examples\n\nFor runnable examples, see [Application Insights Javascript SDK Samples](https://github.com/topics/applicationinsights-js-demo)\n\n## Application Insights Web Basic\n\nFor a lightweight experience, you can instead install the basic version of Application Insights\n```\nnpm i --save @microsoft/applicationinsights-web-basic\n```\nThis version comes with the bare minimum amount of features and functionalities and relies on you to build it up as you see fit. For example, it performs no auto-collection (uncaught exceptions, ajax, etc). The APIs to send certain telemetry types, like `trackTrace`, `trackException`, etc, are not included in this version, so you will need to provide your own wrapper. The only api that is available is `track`. A [sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/applicationinsights-web-sample1/blob/master/testlightsku.html) is located here.\n\n## Available extensions for the SDK\n\n\n| Extensions |\n|---------------|\n| [React](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/tree/master/extensions/applicationinsights-react-js)|\n| [React Native](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/tree/master/extensions/applicationinsights-react-native)|\n\n## Upgrading from the old Version of Application Insights\n\nBreaking changes in the SDK V2 version:\n- To allow for better API signatures, some of the apis such as trackPageView, trackException have been updated.\n- ES3 (IE8) compatibility, while running in IE8 or lower versions of the browser is not an officially supported scenario we are working to maintain ES3 level compatibility to ensure that the SDK will not cause any unexpected failures due to Javascript parsing error. See [ES3/IE8 Compatibility](#es3ie8-compatibility) below for further information.\n- Telemetry envelope has field name and structure changes due to data schema updates.\n- Moved `context.operation` to `context.telemetryTrace`. Some fields were also changed (`operation.id` --> `telemetryTrace.traceID`)\n  - If you want to maunally refresh the current pageview id (e.g. in SPA apps) this can be done with `appInsights.properties.context.telemetryTrace.traceID = Util.newId()`\n\nIf you are using the current application insights PRODUCTION SDK (1.0.20) and want to see if the new SDK works in runtime, please update URL depending on your current SDK loading scenario:\n\n**a)** Download via CDN scenario:\n    Update code snippet that you currently use to point to the following URL:\n    ```\n    "https://az416426.vo.msecnd.net/scripts/b/ai.2.min.js"\n    ```\n\n**b)** NPM scenario:\n    Call downloadAndSetup to download full ApplicationInsights script from CDN and initialize it with instrumentation key.\n\n```ts\nappInsights.downloadAndSetup({\n    instrumentationKey: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx",\n    url: "https://az416426.vo.msecnd.net/scripts/b/ai.2.min.js"\n});\n```\n\nTest in internal environment to verify monitoring telemetry is working as expected. If all works, please update your api signatures appropriately to SDK V2 version and deploy in your production environments.\n\n## Build a new extension for the SDK\n\nThe beta SDK supports the ability to include multiple extensions at runtime. In order to create a new extension, please implement the following interface:\n\n[ITelemetryPlugin](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/blob/master/shared/AppInsightsCore/src/JavaScriptSDK.Interfaces/ITelemetryPlugin.ts)\n\nOn initialization, config.extensions accepts an array of ITelemetryPlugin objects. These are hooked up and ITelemetryPlugin.processTelemetry() is chained based on priority of these plugins.\nPlease note that higher the priority, the later your processing code will be invoked. The SDK supports a plugin model and channels can also be plugged in similarly (advanced scenario).\nTarget scenarios for creating a brand new extension is to share a usage scenario that benefits multiple customers. Please follow guidelines\n\nHere is the priority ranges available:\n\n- Regular extension priority can be between 201 to 499.\n- Priorty range < 201 is reserved.\n- Priority range > 1000 is for channels (advanced scenario)\n\nUsage:\n\n```ts\nconst customPluginInstance = new YourCustomPlugin()\nconst appInsights = new ApplicationInsights({ config: {\n    instrumentationKey: \'YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY_GOES_HERE\',\n    extensions: [customPluginInstance]\n    // Other Configuration Options...\n}});\nappInsights.loadAppInsights();\n```\n\nITelemetryPlugin has a simpler base type IPlugin that you can instantiate for initialization purposes when SDK loads.\n\n## Build & Test this repo\n\n1. Install all dependencies\n\n    ```sh\n    npm install\n    npm install -g @microsoft/rush\n    ```\n\n2. Navigate to the root folder and update rush dependencies\n\n    ```sh\n    rush update\n    ```\n\n3. Build and test\n\n    ```sh\n    rush build\n    npm run test\n    ```\n\n## Performance\n\nAt just ~28 KB gzipped, and taking only ~15 ms to initialize, Application Insights JS adds a negligible amount of loadtime to your website. By using the snippet, minimal components of the library are quickly loaded. In the meantime, the full script is downloaded in the background.\n\nWhile the script downloads from the CDN, all tracking of your page is queued. Once the downloaded script finishes asynchronously initializing, all events that were queued are tracked. As a result, you will not lose any telemetry during the entire life cycle of your page. This setup process provides your page with a seamless analytics system, invisible to your users.\n\n> Summary:\n>\n> - **~28 KB** gzipped\n> - **15 ms** overall initialization time\n> - **Zero** tracking missed during life cycle of page\n\n## Browser Support\n\n![Chrome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alrra/browser-logos/master/src/chrome/chrome_48x48.png) | ![Firefox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alrra/browser-logos/master/src/firefox/firefox_48x48.png) | ![IE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alrra/browser-logos/master/src/edge/edge_48x48.png) | ![Opera](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alrra/browser-logos/master/src/opera/opera_48x48.png) | ![Safari](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alrra/browser-logos/master/src/safari/safari_48x48.png)\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\nLatest \xe2\x9c\x94 | Latest \xe2\x9c\x94 | 9+ Full \xe2\x9c\x94<br>8- Compatible | Latest \xe2\x9c\x94 | Latest \xe2\x9c\x94 |\n\n## Contributing\n\nRead our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to Application Insights.\n\n### Build and Test this Project\n\n```zsh\nnpm install -g @microsoft/rush\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\n### Submitting a Change to this Project\n\n```zsh\n<...added some code...>\nrush change\n<...enter details>\ngit add <...your changes and rush change file...>\ngit commit -m "info about your change"\ngit push\n```\n\n## ES3/IE8 Compatibility\n\nAs an SDK there are numerous users which cannot control the browsers that their customers use. As such we need to ensure that this SDK continues to "work" and does not break the JS execution when loaded by an older browser. While it would be ideal to just not support IE8 and older generation (ES3) browsers there are numerous large customers/users that continue to require pages to "work" and as noted they may or cannot control which browser that their end users choose to use.\n\nThis does NOT mean that we will only support the lowest common set of features, just that we need to maintain ES3 code compatibility and when adding new features they will need to be added in a manner that would not break ES3 Javascript parsing and added as an optional feature.\n\nAs part of enabling ES3/IE8 support we have set the ```tsconfig.json``` to ES3 and ```uglify``` settings in ```rollup.config.js``` transformations to support ie8. This provides a first level of support which blocks anyone from adding unsupported ES3 features to the code and enables the generated javascript to be validily parsed in an ES3+ environment.\n\nEnsuring that the generated code is compatible with ES3 is only the first step, JS parsers will still parse the code when an unsupport core function is used, it will just fail or throw an exception at runtime. Therefore, we also need to require/use polyfil implementations or helper functions to handle those scenarios.\n\nIt should also be noted that the overall goal of ES3/IE8 compatibility is the support at least the following 2 usage usage patterns. By supporting these two (2) basic use-cases, application/developers will be able to determine what browsers their users are using and whether they are experiencing any issues. As the SDK will report the data to the server, thus enabling the insights into whether they need to either fully support ES3/IE8 or provide some sort of browser upgrade notifications.\n- track()\n- trackException()\n\nBeyond terminating support for older browsers that only support ES3, (which we cannot do at this point in time) we will endeavour to maintain support for the above two (2) use-cases.\n\n### ES3/IE8 Features, Solutions, Workarounds and Polyfil style helper functions\nAs part of contributing to the project the following table highlights all of the currently known issues and the available solution/workaround. During PR and reviewing please ensure that you do not use the unsupported feature directly and instead use (or provide) the helper, soultion or workaround.\n\nThis table does not attempt to include ALL of the ES3 unsuported features, just the currently known functions that where being used at the time or writing. You are welcome to contribute to provide additional helpers, workarounds or documentation of values that should not be used.\n\n|  Feature  |  Description  |  Helper, Solution or Workaround |\n|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| ```JSON.stringify(obj)``` | We have a hard requirement on JSON support, however, because of the size of adding a specific JSON polyfil just for our usage we decided not to include our own version. As such any user of this Api **MUST** include a JSON polyfil implementation, otherwise, the API simply will not work. | App/Site **MUST** provide their own JSON polyfil.\n| ```Object.keys()``` | Not provided by ES3, use the helper  | ```CoreUtils.objKeys(obj: {}): string[]``` |\n| ES5+ getters/setters<br>```Object.defineProperty(...)``` | Code will needs to created the individual getters/setters manually in a static initializer. See ```ChannelController.ts``` for example usage.<br>However, to ensure compatibility actual usage of any getters/setters internally in the primary SDK code is not permitted. They may (and should) be used in unit tests to ensure that if used they function as expected (in an ES5+ environment).| ``` CoreUtils.objDefineAccessors<T>(target:any, prop:string, getProp?:() => T, setProp?: (v:T) => void) : boolean``` |\n| ```Object.create(protoObj)``` | Not supported in an ES3 environment, use the helper or direct construct the object with SON style notation (if possible) | ```CoreUtils.objCreate(obj:object):any``` |\n| ```Object.create(protoObj, descriptorSet)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Object.defineProperties()``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Object.getOwnPropertyNames()``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Object.preventExtensions(obj)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Object.isExtensible(obj)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Object.seal(obj)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Object.isSealed(obj)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Object.freeze(obj)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Object.isFrozen(obj)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Array.prototype.indexOf(...)``` | Use the provided helper | ```CoreUtils.arrIndexOf<T>(arr: T[], searchElement: T, fromIndex?: number): number``` |\n| ```Array.prototype.lastIndexOf(...)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Array.prototype.every(...)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Array.prototype.some(...)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Array.prototype.forEach(...)``` | Use the provided helper. | ```arrForEach<T>(arr: T[], callbackfn: (value: T, index?: number, array?: T[]) => void, thisArg?: any):void``` |\n| ```Array.prototype.map(...)``` | Use the provided helper. | ```CoreUtils.arrMap<T,R>(arr: T[], callbackfn: (value: T, index?: number, array?: T[]) => R, thisArg?: any): R[]``` |\n| ```Array.prototype.filter(...)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Array.prototype.reduce(...)``` | Use the provided helper. | ```CoreUtils.arrReduce<T,R>(arr: T[], callbackfn: (previousValue: T|R, currentValue?: T, currentIndex?: number, array?: T[]) => R, initialValue?: R): R``` |\n| ```Array.prototype.reduceRight(...)``` | Not supported and no provided workaround/solution. | N/A |\n| ```Date.prototype.toISOString()``` | Use the provided helper | ```CoreUtils.toISOString(date: Date)``` |\n'
