b"# Azure Architecture Center\n\nMicrosoft patterns & practices\n\n<https://aka.ms/architecture>\n\n## Understanding the local build process\n\nSome of the markdown files are generated from data stored in json files.\nThis is primarily to avoid human error for pages that still require some HTML.\nThe process that converts the json to markdown uses a utility script located in the `build` folder.\nTo run the build script, navigate to the root folder of this repository.\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nnode .\\build\\build.js\n```\n\n## Legal Notices\n\nMicrosoft and any contributors grant you a license to the Microsoft documentation and other content\nin this repository under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode),\nsee the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file, and grant you a license to any code in the repository under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), see the\n[LICENSE-CODE](LICENSE-CODE) file.\n\nMicrosoft, Windows, Microsoft Azure and/or other Microsoft products and services referenced in the documentation\nmay be either trademarks or registered trademarks of Microsoft in the United States and/or other countries.\nThe licenses for this project do not grant you rights to use any Microsoft names, logos, or trademarks.\nMicrosoft's general trademark guidelines can be found at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=254653>.\n\nPrivacy information can be found at <https://privacy.microsoft.com>.\n\nMicrosoft and any contributors reserve all others rights, whether under their respective copyrights, patents,\nor trademarks, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise.\n"
