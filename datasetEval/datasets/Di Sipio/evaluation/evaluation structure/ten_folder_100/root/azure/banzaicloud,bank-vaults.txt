Think heavy steel doors, secret unlocking combinations and burly guards with smack-down attitude. Watch out for clean-up sets.*\n\n*Bank-Vaults is an umbrella project which provides various tools for Vault to make using and operating Hashicorp Vault easier. Its a wrapper for the official Vault client with automatic token renewal and built in Kubernetes support, dynamic database credential provider for Golang SQL based clients. It has a CLI tool to automatically initialize, unseal and configure Vault. It also provides a Kubernetes operator for provisioning, and a mutating webhook for injecting secrets.*\n\n---\n\n**Bank-Vaults** is a core building block of the **[Banzai Cloud Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline)** platform. Some of the usage patterns are highlighted through these blog posts:\n\n**Securing Kubernetes deployments with Vault:**\n\n- [Authentication and authorization of Pipeline users with OAuth2 and Vault](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/oauth2-vault/)\n- [Dynamic credentials with Vault using Kubernetes Service Accounts](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/vault-dynamic-secrets/)\n- [Dynamic SSH with Vault and Pipeline](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/vault-dynamic-ssh/)\n- [Secure Kubernetes Deployments with Vault and Pipeline](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/hashicorp-guest-post/)\n- [Vault Operator](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/vault-operator/)\n- [Vault unseal flow with KMS](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/vault-unsealing/)\n- [Monitoring Vault on Kubernetes using Cloud Native technologies](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/monitoring-vault-grafana/)\n- [Inject secrets directly into pods from Vault](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/inject-secrets-into-pods-vault-revisited/)\n\nWe use Vault across our large Kubernetes deployments and all the projects were `reinventing` the wheel. We have externalized all the codebase into this project and removed all the [Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline) and [Hollowtrees](https://github.com/banzaicloud/hollowtrees) dependencies thus this project can be used independently as a CLI tool to manage Vault, a Golang library to build upon (OAuth2 tokens, K8s auth, Vault operator, dynamic secrets, cloud credential storage, etc), Helm chart for a HA cluster, operator, mutating webhook and a collection of scripts to support some advanced features (dynamic SSH, etc).\n\n>We take bank-vaults\' security and our users\' trust very seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in bank-vaults, please contact us at security@banzaicloud.com.\n\nBank-Vaults is a core part of [Banzai Cloud Pipeline](https://banzaicloud.com/), a Cloud Native application and devops platform that natively supports multi- and hybrid-cloud deployments.
