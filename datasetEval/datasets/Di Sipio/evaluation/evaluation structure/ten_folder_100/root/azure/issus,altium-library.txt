b'# Celestial Altium Library\n\nAn exceptional, open source database library for Altium, currently supporting MSSQL and SQL Azure as the backend for easy use within teams, and no data corruption unlike MS Access.\n\n\nThis library has been built for high quality data, with high quality footprints and high quality 3D models.\n\nJoin us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/MEQ5Xe5) to chat.\n\n# Database Access\nWe had an issue with the database server, and are currently rebuilding the database - it will be finished by the end of November. Check in with the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/MEQ5Xe5) for the latest, or just to say hi!\n\n# Why use an Altium DBLib over an Integrated Library?\n\nAltium Database libraries make you design your schematic with the part you are going to use, rather than a generic part with the same footprint. Rather than selecting "RJ45 Jack" you instead select Amphenol Commercial Products part number RJCSE538001. This is reflected in your BOM - the entire BOM fills itself out, meaning no more trying to remember exactly what part you actually meant to put in there was, or what voltage that capacitor was.\n\nPrior to using a DBLib, it would often take me half a day to fill out the bill of materials. I\'d have to find each resistor on the supplier\'s website, list it down with the supplier\'s part number, manufacturer, manufacturer name, etc... Now I just generate the BOM in the output job, and everything is done. No more trying to remember "was that 33uF cap 25V or 50v?", or finding out after the fact that no, that capacitor isn\'t available as a 47uF 50V variant in that package, despite the fact you were sure it was!\n\nBasically: You save time on the design, and you greatly reduce errors occurring from specifying a part you didn\'t actually use (who hasn\'t accidentally specified a right angle connector variant when it was really vertical on the board - oops?)\n\n# The Library\n### Why use this library over something like Ultra Librarian?\nUltra librarian doesn\'t have high quality 3d models or parametrics. If all you need is basic footprint, Ultra librarian is what you want. If you want something open source, ultra high quality parts and with all the data fields you desire.. then you\'ll probably really like this library.\n\nIf you\'re integrating your electronic design into a housing or designing injection moulded cases for it - you need accurate 3d models or your mechanical engineers will spend a lot of time making sure the case fits your design files.\n\n### Data\nAll parts in the database are matched with every relevant parameter that Digi-Key has for the part, so you can search/filter within Altium for the part you require. If you are looking for low Rds(on) N-Ch fets, just add the Rds(on) column to the Altium library window and sort by it.\n\nEvery part has a link to the part on Digi-key, and has a link to the datasheet for the part for ease of design. Both the Digi-Key part number, price, and manufacturer name/part number are stored, now your BOM will be completely filled out automatically.\n\n### Footprints\nEvery part has a footprint created to match it\'s manufacturers recommended footprint by the manufacturer, or lacking that, an IPC Compliant footprint for the manufacturers specific package sizing. There are no generic footprints within this library, everything is manufacturer specific. \n\nEvery footprint has a high quality, dimensionally accurate, accurately coloured 3d model. For complex parts (connectors like modular jacks), the manufacturers model is preferred however is always fully coloured and checked for accuracy against their drawings and modified as required.  I\'ve found issues with the accuracy of the manufacturer issued model from most models, where they do not match the datasheet - every instance has been checked with the manufacturer and many have re-issued their 3d models because of these checks.\n\nBasic parts (TSSOP/SOP/Resistors etc) I have created every model from scratch in SolidWorks, if the manufacturers dimensions vary from the JEDEC standard, they receive their own version of the 3d model (see SOT-23-3..) For ultra basic parts with no features (QFN/DFN), a black basic Altium 3D extrusion is used of the correct size.\n\nEvery part\'s centre position is where the Pick and place head should grab the part. For companies running their own Pick and Place machine, this is very convenient compared to centres at pin 1/centre of pads - your pick and place export list now has centres in the correct location.\n\n### Symbols \n\nEvery symbol in the library is somewhat standardised as to where pins are located, such as VCC in the top left, GND in the bottom left, user function pins on the right (controllable inputs/outputs). Standard protocols like SPI have the pins in the same order in every part - however manufacturer datasheet labeling is kept (DOUT rather than MISO for example) to make it easier to reference the datasheet. All components within a database category should have similar if not identical layouts/pin groupings where possible. This makes it much easier to switch out components.\n\nAll passive components, such as resistors and capacitors all have the same size symbol lead span, keeping your schematics tidy.\n\n# What components are contained in the library?\nThere are currently over 27000 parts in the library, this number sounds quite large but when you consider you need every value of resistor in 1%, 0.5%, 0.25%, 0.1% and 0.05%, in 0201, 0402, 0603, 0805 and 1206... you\'re now looking at over 5000 resistors.\n\nGenerally only SMT parts are in the library, except connectors, buttons and displays which have a mixture.\n\nThere are currently parts from over 120 manufacturers in the database.\n\n##### Currently there are database views for:\n\n - ADC - Programmable\n - Audio - Amplifier\n - Battery Holder\n - Button - Push\n - Button - Slide\n - Button - Tactile\n - Capacitor - Aluminium\n - Capacitor - Aluminium Polymer\n - Capacitor - Aluminium Through hole\n - Capacitor - Ceramic\n - Capacitor - RF\n - Capacitor - Tantalum\n - Capacitor - Tantalum Polymer\n - Charger\n - Chip LED\n - Connector - Backplane\n - Connector - Barrier Block\n - Connector - Card Edge\n - Connector - Dev Board\n - Connector - Modular\n - Connector - Modular w/Magnetics\n - Connector - Rectangular\n - Connector - RF\n - Connector - SD\n - Connector - Terminal Block\n - Connector - USB\n - Digital Isolator\n - Digital to Analogue Converter\n - Diode - Rectifier\n - Diode - TVS\n - Ferrite Chip\n - Gate Driver\n - Inductor - Power\n - Inductor - RF\n - Interface - CAN\n - Interface - Ethernet\n - Interface - RS485\n - IR Receiver\n - LCD Display - Graphic\n - LED Driver\n - Light Pipe\n - MCU - ARM\n - MCU - AVR\n - Memory - EEPROM\n - Memory - FLASH\n - Motor Driver - Controller\n - Motor Driver - Stepper\n - Mounting Bracket\n - Multiplexer\n - N-Channel Dual FET Array\n - N-Channel FET\n - Optoisolators\n - Oscillator - Crystal\n - Oscillator - MEMS\n - Oscillator - TCXO\n - Oscillator - VCTCXO\n - Oscillator - XO\n - P-Channel Dual FET Array\n - P-Channel FET\n - Power Module\n - Reset Supervisor\n - Resistor - Chip\n - Resistor - Current Sense\n - Resistor - Potentiometer\n - RF Amplifier\n - RF Antenna\n - RF Attenuator\n - RF Detector\n - RF Filter\n - RF Module\n - RF Switch\n - Sensor - Current\n - Sensor - Magnetic\n - Sensor - Motion\n - Sensor - Pressure\n - Sensor - Temperature\n - Sensor - Thermocouple\n - Switch - DIP\n - Test Point\n - Thermistor - NTC\n - Video\n - Voltage Reference\n - Voltage Regulator - Linear\n - Voltage Regulator - Switchmode\n\n\n##### Currently on my ToDo list:\n - STM32F series (STM32F4, STM32F3, STM32F0)\n - Si Labs Gecko series\n - Current Sensors (more of)\n - Dual Row Headers\n - Larger Terminal Blocks (5/5.08mm pitch)\n - Capacitance to Digital Converters\n - More LPC series of M0/M3/M4 (LPC4337)\n - Opto-isolators\n - RF SoC (EZR32WG, CC2640, nRF5)\n - RGB LEDS\n\n# Contributing\n\nWant to contribute? Great!\n\nI\'d really like to find someone with some free time and ASP.Net MVC experience to help me build out a management interface, please contact me - markh@rris.com.au.\n\nTo contribute parts:\nPlease ensure your 3d models are completely accurate to the manufacturer\'s specifications. Do not submit parts with 3d models that are not sourced from the manufacturer, or that you have not created yourself from the manufacturers drawing. Parts sourced from the manufacturer should be correctly coloured in, most manufacturers give you colourless or very oddly coloured models (Hirose and JST especially.)\n\nStandard Colours:\n- Black:  R:26 G:26 B:26\n- Tin/Lead/other "silver" plating:  R:204 G:206 B:204\n- Gold: R:255 G:206 B:127\n- White: R:255 G:255 B:255\n\nSome components will have blues/beiges/off white colours from their ceramics, plastics, or paint - try to match the colour shown in pictures as accurately as possible.\n\nLED Colours:\n- Red: R177 B25 G25\n- Green: R73 G169 B84\n- Blue: R2 G61 B210\n- Yellow: R255 G239 B35\n\nIf you cannot colour your 3D model, do not submit it, ask someone (me?) to colour it for you. \n\nAll models should have fillets, drafts and features as the real device would. If you can see it in the manufacturers drawing, it should be in the model. If you can see it in a photo or render on Digi-Keys site, it should be in the model. This library should only contain high quality parts.\n\nAll footprints should match the specific parts manufacturer drawing, either as their recommended land pattern, or if that does not exist, then the generated IPC Compliant footprint that Altium made. Please ensure pin 1 is clear marked - a single dot to mark pin 1 is not clear enough, it can be easily lost on high density boards. Check what other similar parts have.\n\nSymbols should be laid out with pins in logical groups, not as they appear on the package or in their pin order. Do not use generic symbols for specialised parts. If an ISO/ANSI standard symbol exists for a type of component (transistor for example), use it.\n\n\n## Altium License\n\nI have been asked several times if I have a legal Altium license - yes I do, my Altium user profile is [here (must login to view)](https://userprofile.live.altium.com/#user/EFBFF7A4-52D2-4EBA-8F30-497D6CEB8202)\n\nLicense\n----\n\nYou may use this library commercially in commercial designs, however you may not charge your clients for component design time if you are just going to use a part from this library.
