b"# Azure SDK for Python\n\n[![Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/azure-core.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure/) [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_apis/build/status/python/python%20-%20core%20-%20ci?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build/latest?definitionId=458&branchName=master) [![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-analyzed-blue.svg)](https://azuresdkartifacts.blob.core.windows.net/azure-sdk-for-python/dependencies/dependencies.html)\n\nThis repository contains official Python libraries for Azure services. For documentation go to [Azure SDK for Python documentation](http://aka.ms/python-docs).\n\nYou can find a complete list of all the packages for these libraries [here](./packages.md).\n\n## Getting started\n\nFor your convenience, each service has a separate set of libraries that you can choose to use instead of one, large Azure package. To get started with a specific library, see the `README.md` (or `README.rst`) file located in the library's project folder.\n\nYou can find service libraries in the `/sdk` directory.\n\n### Prerequisites\nThe client libraries are supported on Python 2.7 and 3.5.3 or later.\n\n## Packages available\nEach service might have a number of libraries available from each of the following categories:\n* [Client - November 2019 Releases](#Client-November-2019-Releases)\n* [Client - Previous Versions](#Client-Previous-Versions)\n* [Management](#Management)\n\n\n### Client: November 2019 Releases\nNew wave of packages that we are announcing as **GA** and several that are currently releasing in **preview**. These libraries allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. These libraries share a number of core functionalities such as: retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc. that can be found in the [azure-core](./sdk/core/azure-core) library. You can learn more about these libraries by reading guidelines that they follow [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python_introduction.html).\n\nThe libraries released in the November 2019 GA release:\n- [azure-keyvault-keys](./sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys)\n- [azure-keyvault-secrets](./sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-secrets)\n- [azure-identity](./sdk/identity/azure-identity)\n- [azure-storage-blob](./sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob)\n- [azure-storage-queue](./sdk/storage/azure-storage-queue)\n\nThe libraries released in the November 2019 preview:\n- [azure-cosmos](./sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos)\n- [azure-eventhubs](./sdk/eventhub/azure-eventhubs)\n- [azure-storage-file-share](./sdk/storage/azure-storage-file-share)\n\n> NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-preview libraries.\n\n### Client: Previous Versions\nLast stable versions of packages that have been provided for usage with Azure and are production-ready. These libraries provide you with similar functionalities to the Preview ones as they allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. They might not implement the [guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python_introduction.html) or have the same feature set as the Novemeber releases. They do however offer wider coverage of services. \n\n### Management\nLibraries which enable you to provision specific resources. They are responsible for directly mirroring and consuming Azure service's REST endpoints. The management libraries use the `azure-mgmt-<service name>` convention for their package names.\n\n## Need help?\n* For detailed documentation visit our [Azure SDK for Python documentation](https://aka.ms/python-docs)\n* File an issue via [Github Issues](../../issues)\n* Check [previous questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure+python) or ask new ones on StackOverflow using `azure` and `python` tags.\n\n### Reporting security issues and security bugs\n\nSecurity issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) <secure@microsoft.com>.
