b'# Azure Container Hackfest\n\n_Delivering modern cloud native applications with \xe2\x80\x8bopen source technologies on Azure\xe2\x80\x8b_\n\n\n**NOTE: We have moved this content over to a new and updated repository https://github.com/Azure/kubernetes-hackfest**\n\n## Overview\n\nThis workshop will guide you through migrating an application from "on-premise" to containers running in Azure Kubernetes Service.\n\nThe labs are based upon a node.js application that allows for voting on the Justice League Superheroes (with more options coming soon). Data is stored in MongoDB.\n\n> Note: These labs are designed to run on a Linux CentOS VM running in Azure (jumpbox) along with Azure Cloud Shell. They can potentially be run locally on a Mac or Windows, but the instructions are not written towards that experience. ie - "You\'re on your own."\n\n> Note: Since we are working on a jumpbox, note that Copy and Paste are a bit different when working in the terminal. You can use Shift+Ctrl+C for Copy and Shift+Ctrl+V for Paste when working in the terminal. Outside of the terminal Copy and Paste behaves as expected using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. \n\n## Lab Guides - Day 1\n  0. [Setup Lab environment](labs/day1-labs/00-lab-environment.md)\n  1.
