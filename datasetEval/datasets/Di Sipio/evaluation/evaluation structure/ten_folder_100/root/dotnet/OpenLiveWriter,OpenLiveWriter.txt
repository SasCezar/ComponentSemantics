The team was acquired by Microsoft \nin 2006 and organized with the Spaces team. Becky Pezely joined the team and over time, the team grew and shipped\nmany popular releases of Windows Live Writer.\n\nAs Microsoft was planning for the version of Windows Live that would coincide with Windows 8 operating system\nrelease, the teams that built the Windows Live client apps for Windows were encouraged to focus on building a \nsmaller set of Windows 8 apps designed to work well with both traditional PC input mechanisms and touch. \nWith the rise of micro-blogging platforms and other forms of sharing, eventually this team decided to conclude\ntheir work on Windows Live Writer with Windows Live Writer 2012.\n\nEven though there was no active development, Windows Live Writer continued to be a favorite tool of a passionate\ncommunity of Windows PC users for authoring, editing, and publishing blog posts. Data from WordPress.com at the \ntime suggested that Windows Live Writer (even two years after active development ended) was the #1 app for authoring\na blog post to WordPress.com from a Windows PC. \n\nA few employees at Microsoft took an interest in reviving Live Writer as an open source project in their\nspare time.  By January 2015, a group of about a half-dozen engineers interested in spending some of their\nvolunteer time to help release an updated version of Live Writer had found each other and began work on getting\nthis open source fork of Live Writer formed and ready to ship. In December 2015 Microsoft donated the code\nto the .NET Foundation and this passionate group of volunteer engineers rapidly assembled the first open source\nversion.\n\n### Building\nOpen Live Writer can be built by running build.cmd found in this directory.   \nIt can be opened in Visual Studio.  The solution is in src/managed/writer.sln -- if you see errors in Visual Studio run build.cmd from the command prompt and it should be resolved.\nThe main program is src/managed/OpenLiveWriter/ApplicationMain.cs .\nTo run from Visual Studio, set the startup project to OpenLiveWriter.\n\n### .NET Foundation\n\nThe Open Live Writer project is supported by the [.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org).\n"
