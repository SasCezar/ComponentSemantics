b'## Opserver\n[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/7m0b1e4orimk5nvr/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/StackExchange/opserver/branch/master)\n[![Open Source Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/opserver/opserver/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/opserver/opserver)\n\nOpserver is a monitoring system by the team at [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com), home of [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).  It is a tool for monitoring:  \n* Servers/Switches & anything supported by Bosun, Orion, or direct WMI monitoring\n* SQL Clusters & Single Instances \n* Redis \n* Elasticsearch \n* Exception Logs (from StackExchange.Exceptional) \n* HAproxy\n* PagerDuty\n* CloudFlare DNS\n* ... and more as we go   \n\nKnown as \xe2\x80\x9cstatus\xe2\x80\x9d internally, Opserver provides a fast overall view of all our major systems that also allows drilling in for more detail.  For an idea of the UI, you can see some [screenshots from our Velocity 2013 talk](https://imgur.com/a/dawwf).\n\n### Installation\nInstallation should be a snap, just build this project as-is and deploy it as an IIS website. \nIf monitoring windows servers and using integrated auth sections (e.g. live polling, SQL, exception logs) then using a service account with needed permissions is all you need to do on the auth side.\nAfter that, configure Opserver to monitor your systems, keep reading for how.\n\n### Security Configuration\n`/Config/SecuritySettings.config` contains the security settings for the Opserver website itself, there are a few built-in providers already:\n* Active Directory ("ad")\n* "Everyone\'s an admin" ("alladmin")\n* "View All" (the default)\n\nThere is a `SecuritySettings.config.example` as a reference.  You can optionally add networks that can see the main dashboard without any authentication when using any provider.  This is useful for fully automated screens like a TV in an office or data center.\n\nIf you are using Active Directory authentication, you should edit the ViewGroups and AdminGroups in the Web.Config. You can also edit the ViewGroups and AdminGroups on a per monitor basis by adding `"AdminGroups": "GroupName",` or `"ViewGRoups": "GroupName",` to the json config file.\n\nOne cause of the \'No Configuration\' message being displayed is if you do not have any permissions to any of your configured monitors. You can see what you were authenticated as, and what roles you were granted by browsing to /about. \n\n### Monitoring Configuration\nThe basic configuration implementation is via `.json` files, for which `.json.example` files are included in the `/config` directory of the Opserver project.  These `.example` files are exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s running in the Stack Exchange production environment, minus any passwords or internal-only URLs.  You are also welcome to implement your own settings provider that has a completely different source, for example JSON from MongoDB, or SQL, or\xe2\x80\xa6whatever you can come up with.  Settings changes will be hooked up to events but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t complete just yet, since we build every change and Opserver restarts, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a priority.\n\nWe recommend using a service account with the necessary permissions for monitoring, this eliminates any passwords in your configuration files and makes management easier, that\'s the practice in place at Stack Exchange.\n\nEven if you have correctly configured your monitors, you still may not see any data. Each monitor configuration has an enabled flag which must return true for a monitor section to appear in OpServer. \n\nYou can browse to /about to review which monitors have been enabled. \n\n### Jira Actions Configuration\nYou can use Jira to create issues using the links rendered in the exception details page. \n\nIn order to use Jira \n\n* You have to enable Exception monitoring \n* Add JiraSettings.json file under `/config` folder (JiraSettings.json.example file is included)\n* Enable REST api on Jira\n\n[Jira action screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/XtW0j)\n\n### PagerDuty Configuration\nYou can connect OpServer to your pagerduty installation.\n\nYou need a PagerDuty ReadWrite API Key (RO will work for viewing but will throw errors when you do a RW action). \n\nYou need to set the following options in PagerDutySettings.json to get a minimally working setup: \n\n  * APIKey: Your Pager Duty API Key\n  * APIBaseURL: https://<your_domain>.pagerduty.com/api/v1\n\nThere is a username map option for when your email address does not match your OpServer login credentials. \n\nFor example George has an email of george@example.com, and a login of gsock. The plugin needs to be told how to map the email on the pagerduty side to the username on the opserver side. To setup a map to allow George to be discovered and associated correctly, you would do the following: \n\n```json\n"UserNameMap": [\n  {"OpServerName": "gsock", "EmailUser": "george"},\n],\n```\n\nThe UserNameMap is an array of OpserverName (login Name) and EmailUser (user part of email associated to PagerDuty Account). You can have as many User Name Mappings as you need.\n\nThere is a HeaderHTML tag that lets you put arbitrary html above all content. You can use this to place notices, or messages for people who do not view the page all the time at the top. We use it to explain how to contact the on call Engineer. \n\n\n### Open Source Projects in Use\n[StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis) by Marc Gravell  \n[Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper/) by Stack Exchange  \n[JSON.Net](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) by James Newton-King     \n[MiniProfiler](https://miniprofiler.com/) by Stack Exchange    \n[StackExchange.Exceptional](https://github.com/NickCraver/StackExchange.Exceptional) by Nick Craver  \n\nJavaScript:  \n[d3.js](https://d3js.org/) by Michael Bostock  \n[ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/) by Cynthia Brewer and Mark Harrower  \n[HTML Query Plan](https://github.com/JustinPealing/html-query-plan) by Justin Pealing  \n[isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/) by Metafizzy  \n[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) by The jQuery Foundation  \n[jQuery cookie plugin](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) by Klaus Hartl  \n[jQuery autocomplete](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-autocomplete/) by J\xc3\xb6rn Zaefferer  \n[prettify](https://github.com/google/code-prettify) by Google  \n[TableSorter](http://tablesorter.com) by Christian Bach  \n[Toastr](https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr) by John Papa and Hans Fj\xc3\xa4llemark  \n\n### License\nOpserver is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n### Props\nWe\'d like to thank several people outside Stack Exchange for large contributions to Opserver\'s development.\n\n* [Brent Ozar](https://www.brentozar.com/) for lots of (continuing) help on the SQL monitoring, with some of the initial queries and help letting us know many use cases to cover.  We\'ll be integrating some of the awesome tooling Brent and his team have to further assist DBAs and developers (like [sp_Blitz](https://www.brentozar.com/blitz/), [sp_BlitzIndex](https://www.brentozar.com/blitzindex/), and some you\'ll hear about soon).  \n* [Adam Machanic](http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/) for [sp_WhoIsActive](http://whoisactive.com/), which powers the active tab for a SQL Instance.  He also assisted with use cases and performance tuning on the use of sp_WhoIsActive.  \n* The [Sentry One](https://www.sentryone.com/) guys: [Aaron Bertrand](http://sqlblog.com/blogs/aaron_bertrand/) and [Kevin Kline](http://kevinekline.com/) for even more SQL use cases, and their help with upcoming integration with SQL Sentry.\n'
