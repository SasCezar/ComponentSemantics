Via our Electron.NET IPC bridge we can invoke Electron APIs from .NET.\n\nThe CLI extensions hosts our toolset to build and start Electron.NET applications.\n\n## Wait - you host a .NET Core app inside Electron? Why?\n\nWell... there are lots of different approaches how to get a X-plat desktop app running. We thought it would be nice for .NET devs to use the ASP.NET Core environment and just embed it inside a pretty robust X-plat enviroment called Electron. Porting Electron to .NET is not a goal of this project, at least we don\'t have any clue how to do it. We just combine ASP.NET Core & Electron. \n\n# NuGet:\n\n* API [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ElectronNET.API.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElectronNET.API/) \n* CLI [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ElectronNET.CLI.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElectronNET.CLI/)\n\n# Requirements to run:\n\nThe current Electron.NET CLI builds Windows/macOS/Linux binaries. Our API uses .NET Core 3.0, so our minimum base OS is the same as [.NET Core 3.0](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.0/3.0-supported-os.md).\n\nAlso you should have installed:\n\n* npm \n\n# Community\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/ElectronNET/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/ElectronNET/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\n\n# Usage:\n\nTo activate and communicate with the "native" (sort of native...) Electron API include the [ElectronNET.API NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElectronNET.API/) in your ASP.NET Core app.\n\n````\nPM> Install-Package ElectronNET.API\n````\n## Program.cs\n\nYou start Electron.NET up with an `UseElectron` WebHostBuilder-Extension. \n\n```csharp\npublic static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args)\n{\n    return WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\n        .UseStartup<Startup>()\n        .UseElectron(args)\n        .Build();\n}\n```\n\n## Startup.cs\n\nOpen the Electron Window in the Startup.cs file: \n\n```csharp\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n{            \n    services.AddMvc(option => option.EnableEndpointRouting = false);\n}\n\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)\n{\n    if (env.IsDevelopment())\n    {\n        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\n        app.UseBrowserLink();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");\n    }\n\n    app.UseStaticFiles();\n\n    app.UseMvc(routes =>\n    {\n        routes.MapRoute(\n            name: "default",\n            template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");\n    });\n\n    // Open the Electron-Window here\n    Task.Run(async () => await Electron.WindowManager.CreateWindowAsync());\n}\n```\n\n__Please note:__ Currently it is important to use ASP.NET Core with MVC. If you are working with the dotnet CLI, use\n\n```\ndotnet new mvc\n```\n\n## Start the Application\n\nTo start the application make sure you have installed the "[ElectronNET.CLI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElectronNET.CLI/)" packages as global tool:\n\n```\ndotnet tool install ElectronNET.CLI -g\n```\n\nAt the first time, you need an Electron.NET project initialization. Type the following command in your ASP.NET Core folder:\n\n```\nelectronize init\n```\n\n* Now a electronnet.manifest.json should appear in your ASP.NET Core project\n* Now run the following:\n\n```\nelectronize start\n```\n### Note\n> Only the first electronize start is slow. The next will go on faster.\n\n## Debug\n\nStart your Electron.NET application with the Electron.NET CLI command. In Visual Studio attach to your running application instance. Go in the __Debug__ Menu and click on __Attach to Process...__. Sort by your projectname on the right and select it on the list.\n\n## Usage of the Electron-API\n\nA complete documentation will follow. Until then take a look in the source code of the sample application:  \n[Electron.NET API Demos](https://github.com/ElectronNET/electron.net-api-demos)  \n\nIn this YouTube video, we show you how you can create a new project, use the Electron.NET API, debug a application and build an executable desktop app for Windows: [Electron.NET - Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuM6AojRFHk)  \n  \n## Build\n\nHere you need the Electron.NET CLI as well. Type the following command in your ASP.NET Core folder:\n\n```\nelectronize build /target win\n```\n\nThere are additional platforms available:\n\n```\nelectronize build /target win\nelectronize build /target osx\nelectronize build /target linux\n```\n\nThose three "default" targets will produce x64 packages for those platforms.\n\nFor certain NuGet packages or certain scenarios you may want to build a pure x86 application. To support those things you can define the desired [.NET Core runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog), the [electron platform](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/blob/master/docs/api.md#platform) and [electron architecture](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/blob/master/docs/api.md#arch) like this:\n\n```\nelectronize build /target custom win7-x86;win32 /electron-arch ia32 \n```\n\nThe end result should be an electron app under your __/bin/desktop__ folder.\n\n### Note\n> macOS builds can\'t be created on Windows machines because they require symlinks that aren\'t supported on Windows (per [this Electron issue](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/issues/71)). macOS builds can be produced on either Linux or macOS machines.\n\n# Working with this Repo\n\nThis repository consists of the main parts (API & CLI) and it\'s own "playground" ASP.NET Core application. Both main parts produce local NuGet packages, that are versioned with 99.0.0. The first thing you will need is to run one of the buildAll scripts (.cmd for Windows, the other for macOS/Linux).\n\nIf you look for pure __[demo projects](https://github.com/ElectronNET)__ checkout the other repositories. \n\nThe problem working with this repository is, that NuGet has a pretty aggressive cache, see [here for further information](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET/wiki).\n\n# Contributing\nFeel free to submit a pull request if you find any bugs (to see a list of active issues, visit the [Issues section](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET/issues).\nPlease make sure all commits are properly documented.\n\n# Authors\n\n* **Gregor Biswanger** - (Microsoft MVP, Intel Black Belt and Intel Software Innovator) is a freelance lecturer, consultant, trainer, author and speaker.

This now uses [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration) and the necessary configuration to build is made in the **electron.manifest.json** file. In addition, own Electron.NET configurations are stored. Please make sure that your **electron.manifest.json** file has the following new structure:\n\n```\n{\n  "executable": "{{executable}}",\n  "splashscreen": {\n    "imageFile": ""\n  },\n  "singleInstance": false,\n  "build": {\n    "appId": "com.{{executable}}.app",\n    "productName": "{{executable}}",\n    "copyright": "Copyright \xc2\xa9 2019",\n    "buildVersion": "1.0.0",\n    "compression": "maximum",\n    "directories": {\n      "output": "../../../bin/Desktop"\n    },\n    "extraResources": [\n      {\n        "from": "./bin",\n        "to": "bin",\n        "filter": ["**/*"]\n      }\n    ],\n    "files": [\n      {\n        "from": "./ElectronHostHook/node_modules",\n        "to": "ElectronHostHook/node_modules",\n        "filter": ["**/*"]\n      },\n      "**/*"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## ElectronNET.CLI Version 0.0.9\n\nIn the Version 0.0.9 the CLI was not a global tool and needed to be registred like this in the .csproj:\n\n```\n<ItemGroup>\n     <DotNetCliToolReference Include="ElectronNET.CLI" Version="0.0.9" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\nAfter you edited the .csproj-file, you need to restore your NuGet packages within your Project. Run the following command in your ASP.NET Core folder:\n\n```\ndotnet restore\n```\n\n\nIf you still use this version you will need to invoke it like this:\n\n```\ndotnet electronize ...\n```\n\n## Node Integration\nElectron.NET requires Node Integration to be enabled for IPC to function.  If you are not using the IPC functionality you can disable Node Integration like so:\n\n```csharp\nWebPreferences wp = new WebPreferences();\nwp.NodeIntegration = false;\nBrowserWindowOptions browserWindowOptions = new BrowserWindowOptions\n{\n    WebPreferences = wp\n}\n\n```\n'
