It allows PHP to be executed within the .NET framework, thereby opening the door for PHP developers into the world of .NET \xe2\x80\x93 and vice versa.\n\n## Status and Compatibility\nYou can find an up-to-date status of the project in our [Roadmap](https://docs.peachpie.io/roadmap/) section. Please note that the status is dynamic; PeachPie is a work in progress, which means that the list of finished and planned features frequently changes and will be updated on a regular basis. To see the current status of compatibility with the PHP language, please refer to our [Compatibility overview](https://docs.peachpie.io/php/Compatibility/). \n\n## Project goals\n- **Increased performance**: PeachPie\'s extensive type analysis and the influence of Microsoft Roslyn should provide an improved performance of PHP applications and components. \n\n- **Security**: since programs run within the standardized and manageable .NET or .NET Core environment, the code is fully verifiable without any unsafe constructs. In addition, PHP applications can be distributed source-lessly for added security benefits. \n\n- **Cross-platform development**: the project compiles legacy PHP code into portable class libraries, enabling developers to build cross-platform apps and libraries for Microsoft platforms.  \n\n- **Full .NET compatibility**: compiled programs run on the reimplemented PeachPie runtime, fully compatibly with the PHP runtime.\n\n- **Both-way interoperability**: the project allows for hybrid applications, where parts are written in C# and others in PHP. The parts will be entirely compatible and can communicate seamlessly, all within the .NET framework.  \n\n\n## How to use PeachPie\nThere are currently two ways of using PeachPie via `msbuild`: in your favorite shell or comfortably in Visual Studio 2017/Visual Studio Code using our official extensions. \n\n### Visual Studio\nDownload our official [Visual Studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iolevel.peachpie-vs), which makes working with PeachPie compiler as convenient as possible. The extension allows you to easily create a new project using our templates, build & debug, profile your PHP code using the VS diagnostic tools and deploy your project to Azure:\n\n<p align="center">\n<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iolevel.peachpie-vs" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/iolevel/peachpie-vs/blob/master/imgs/peachpie-new-project.gif?raw=true" \nalt="Peachpie Extension" border="10" /></a> \n</p>\n\n### Visual Studio Code \nGrab our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iolevel.peachpie-vscode) to quickstart your development with a more lightweight editor. The extension automatically installs all required dependencies, enables the `PeachPie: Create project` command, syntax error underlining and PeachPie analytics:\n\n<p align="center">\n<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iolevel.peachpie-vscode" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iolevel/peachpie-vscode/master/src/Peachpie.VSCode/images/tEDLQt.gif" \nalt="Peachpie Extension" border="10" /></a> \n</p>\n\n### Command line building\nAlternatively, you can also work with PeachPie on the command line. Please refer to our [short introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVWVInYiYLY) to see how to run the compiler on the command line and to the [Getting Started](https://docs.peachpie.io/get-started/) section in our documentation. \n\n## How to contribute?\nWe can use all the help we can get.
