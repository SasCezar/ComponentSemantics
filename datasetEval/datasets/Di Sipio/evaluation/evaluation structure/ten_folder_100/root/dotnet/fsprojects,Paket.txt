You have no control over this process.\n\nPaket on the other hand maintains this information on a consistent and stable basis within the [`paket.lock` file][7] in the solution root.\nThis file, together with the [`paket.dependencies` file][8] enables you to determine exactly what\'s happening with your dependencies.\n\nPaket also enables you to [reference files directly from git][9] repositories or any [http-resource][11].\n\nFor more reasons see the [FAQ][10].\n\n## Online resources\n\n - [Source code][1]\n - [Documentation][2]\n - [Getting started guide](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/get-started.html)\n - Download [paket.exe][3]\n - Download [paket.bootstrapper.exe][3]\n\n## Troubleshooting and support\n\n - Found a bug or missing a feature? Feed the [issue tracker][4].\n - Announcements and related miscellanea through Twitter ([@PaketManager][5])\n \n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Windows\n - As of https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/pull/2664, paket now automatically bootstraps all required dependencies and builds on a clean windows installation.\n\n### Linux\n\n - up-to-date Mono (>= 5.0 required, >= 5.2 recommended, just install the latest nightly)\n - up-to-date MSBuild (>= 15.0, support for "Directory.Build.props" required)\n\n On most distros, it should be enough to follow [this guide](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/) and install ``mono-devel``, which contains MSBuild.\n Note: if the paket build script fails at ``paket restore`` just rerun it a few times until it succeeds.\n\n## Quick contributing guide\n\n - Fork and clone locally.\n - Build the solution with Visual Studio, `build.cmd` or `build.sh`.\n - Create a topic specific branch in git. Add a nice feature in the code. Do not\n   forget to add tests and/or docs.\n - Run `build.cmd` (`build.sh` on Mono) to make sure all tests are still\n   passing.\n - When built, you\'ll find the binaries in `./bin` which you can then test\n   with locally, to ensure the bug or feature has been successfully implemented.\n - Send a Pull Request.\n\nIf you want to contribute to the [docs][2] then please modify the markdown files in `/docs/content` and send a pull request.\nNote, that short description and syntax for each command is generated automatically from the `Paket.Commands` module.\n\n## License\n\nThe [MIT license][6]\n\n## Maintainer(s)\n\n- [@forki](https://github.com/forki)\n- [@agross](https://github.com/agross)\n- [@cloudroutine](https://github.com/cloudroutine)\n- [@matthid](https://github.com/matthid)\n- [@isaacabraham](https://github.com/isaacabraham)\n- [@theimowski](https://github.com/theimowski)\n\nThe default maintainer account for projects under "fsprojects" is [@fsprojectsgit](https://github.com/fsprojectsgit) - F# Community Project Incubation Space (repo management)\n\n [1]: https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/\n [2]: https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/\n [3]: https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/releases/latest\n [4]: https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/issues\n [5]: https://twitter.com/PaketManager\n [6]: https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\n [7]: https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/lock-file.html\n [8]: https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/dependencies-file.html\n [9]: https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/git-dependencies.html\n [10]: https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/faq.html\n [11]: https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/http-dependencies.html\n [badge-pr-stats]: https://www.issuestats.com/github/fsprojects/Paket/badge/pr\n [badge-issue-stats]: https://www.issuestats.com/github/fsprojects/Paket/badge/issue\n [link-issue-stats]: https://www.issuestats.com/github/fsprojects/Paket\n'
