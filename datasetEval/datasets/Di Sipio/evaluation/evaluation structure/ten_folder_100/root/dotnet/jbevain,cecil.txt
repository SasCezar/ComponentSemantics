b"Cecil\n=====\n\nMono.Cecil is a library to generate and inspect programs and libraries in the ECMA CIL form.\n\nTo put it simply, you can use Cecil to:\n\n* Analyze .NET binaries using a simple and powerful object model, without having to load assemblies to use Reflection.\n* Modify .NET binaries, add new metadata structures and alter the IL code.\n\nCecil has been around since 2004 and is [widely used](https://github.com/jbevain/cecil/wiki/Users) in the .NET community. If you're using Cecil, or depend on a framework, project, or product using it, please consider [sponsoring Cecil](https://github.com/sponsors/jbevain/).\n\nRead about the Cecil development on the [development log](http://cecil.pe).\n\nTo discuss Cecil, the best place is the [mono-cecil](https://groups.google.com/group/mono-cecil) Google Group.\n\nCecil is a project under the benevolent umbrella of the [.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/).\n"
