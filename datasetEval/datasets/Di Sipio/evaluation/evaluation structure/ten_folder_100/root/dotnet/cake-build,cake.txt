If you prefer to invoke the Cake\nexecutable yourself, [take a look at the command line usage](https://cakebuild.net/docs/cli/usage).\n\nThis example is also available on our homepage:\n[https://cakebuild.net/docs/tutorials/setting-up-a-new-project](https://cakebuild.net/docs/tutorials/setting-up-a-new-project)\n\n### 1. Install the Cake bootstrapper\n\nThe bootstrapper is used to download Cake and the tools required by the\nbuild script.\n\n##### Windows\n\n```powershell\nInvoke-WebRequest https://cakebuild.net/download/bootstrapper/windows -OutFile build.ps1\n```\n\n##### Linux\n\n```console\ncurl -Lsfo build.sh https://cakebuild.net/download/bootstrapper/linux\n```\n\n##### OS X\n\n```console\ncurl -Lsfo build.sh https://cakebuild.net/download/bootstrapper/osx\n```\n\n### 2. Create a Cake script\n\nAdd a cake script called `build.cake` to the same location as the\nbootstrapper script that you downloaded.\n\n```cake\nvar target = Argument("target", "Default");\n\nTask("Default")\n  .Does(() =>\n{\n  Information("Hello World!");\n});\n\nRunTarget(target);\n```\n\n### 3. Run it!\n\n##### Windows\n\n```powershell\n# Execute the bootstrapper script.\n./build.ps1\n```\n\n##### Linux / OS X\n\n```console\n# Adjust the permissions for the bootstrapper script.\nchmod +x build.sh\n\n# Execute the bootstrapper script.\n./build.sh\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nSo you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about contributing to Cake?
