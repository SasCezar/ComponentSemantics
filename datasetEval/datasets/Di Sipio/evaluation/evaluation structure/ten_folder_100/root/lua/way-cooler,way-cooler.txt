The simplest way to execute both\nis to run `way-cooler -c </path/to/patched/awesome>`.\n\nThough technically they can run standalone, the compositor is not usable by\nitself and the client will fail out in other compositor due to the custom\nprotocols not being present.\n\n## Development\n\nWay Cooler is under active development. If you would like to contribute you can\ncontact me best on [IRC][] (I also hang out on freenode).\n\n**Master is not usable for production**. There are old versions of Way Cooler\nthat do work, however:\n\n* Is written in Rust and must be built with `cargo`.\n* They use an old framework, [wlc][], and thus are very limited and buggy.\n* Was not designed to emulate Awesome, but instead has [i3][] tiling and its own\n  (very incomplete) Lua libraries.\n\n[Wayland]: https://wayland.freedesktop.org/\n[wlc]: https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc\n[AwesomeWM]: https://awesomewm.org/\n[wlroots]: https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots\n[IRC]: https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=awesome&uio=d4\n[i3]: https://i3wm.org\n'
