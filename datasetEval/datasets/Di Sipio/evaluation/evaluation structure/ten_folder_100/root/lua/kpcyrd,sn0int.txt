It was built for IT security professionals and bug hunters to\ngather intelligence about a given target or about yourself. sn0int is\nenumerating attack surface by semi-automatically processing public information\nand mapping the results in a unified format for followup investigations.\n\n[ipa]: http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=sno%C9%AAnt\n\nAmong other things, sn0int is currently able to:\n\n- Harvest subdomains from certificate transparency logs and passive dns\n- Enrich ip addresses with asn and geoip info\n- Harvest emails from pgp keyservers and whois\n- Discover compromised logins in breaches\n- Find somebody's profiles across the internet\n- Enumerate local networks with unique techniques like passive arp\n- Gather information about phonenumbers\n- Attempt to bypass cloudflare with shodan\n- Harvest data and images from instagram profiles\n- Scan images for nudity\n\nsn0int is heavily inspired by recon-ng and maltego, but remains more flexible\nand is fully opensource. None of the investigations listed above are hardcoded\nin the source, instead those are provided by modules that are executed in a\nsandbox. You can easily extend sn0int by writing your own modules and share\nthem with other users by publishing them to the sn0int registry. This allows\nyou to ship updates for your modules on your own since you don't need to send a\npull request.\n\nFor questions and support join us on IRC: [irc.hackint.org:6697/#sn0int](https://webirc.hackint.org/#irc://irc.hackint.org/#sn0int)\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/shZ3TVY1o0opGFln3Oi2DAMCB.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/shZ3TVY1o0opGFln3Oi2DAMCB)\n\n## Installation\n\nArchlinux\n\n    pacman -S sn0int\n\nMac OSX\n\n    brew install sn0int\n\nFor everything else please have a look at the [detailed list][1].\n\n[1]: https://sn0int.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html\n\n## Getting started\n\n- [Installation](https://sn0int.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)\n  -

It's often difficult to understand that\nsomething is easier to discover than some people assume, putting them at risk\nof false security.\n\nIt's also designed to be useful for red team assessments and bug bounties,\nwhich also help companies to identify weaknesses that could result in a\ncompromise.\n\nSome functionality was written to do the same thing for individuals to raise\nawareness about personal attack surface, privacy and how much data is publicly\navailable. These issues are often out of scope in bug bounties and sometimes by\ndesign. We believe that blaming the user is the wrong approach and these issues\nshould be addressed at the root cause by the people designing those systems.\n\n## License\n\nGPLv3+\n"
