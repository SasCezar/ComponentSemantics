b"# Luakit\n\nluakit is a fast, light and simple to use micro-browser framework extensible\nby Lua using the WebKit web content engine and the GTK+ toolkit.\n\n## Don't Panic!\n\nYou don't have to be a developer to use luakit on a daily basis. If you are\nfamiliar with vimperator, pentadactyl, jumanji, uzbl & etc you will find\nluakit behaves similarly out of the box.\n\n## Requirements\n\n * GTK+ 3\n * Lua 5.1 or LuaJIT 2\n * lfs (lua file system)\n * webkit2gtk\n * sqlite3\n\n## Compiling\n\nTo compile the stock luakit run:\n\n    make\n\nTo link against LuaJIT (if you have LuaJIT installed) run:\n\n    make USE_LUAJIT=1\n\nTo build with a custom compiler run:\n\n    make CC=clang\n\nTo build with local paths (interesting for package maintainer and contributers). You may wish to build luakit with:\n\n    make DEVELOPMENT_PATHS=1\n\nThis lets you start luakit from the build directory, using the config and libraries within the same.\n\nThe `USE_LUAJIT=1`, `PREFIX=/path`, `DEVELOPMENT_PATHS=1`, `CC=clang`\nbuild options do not conflict. You can use whichever you desire.\n\n## Installing\n\nTo install luakit run:\n\n    sudo make install\n\nThe luakit binary will be installed at:\n\n    /usr/local/bin/luakit\n\nAnd configs to:\n\n    /etc/xdg/luakit/\n\nAnd the luakit libraries to:\n\n    /usr/local/share/luakit/lib/\n\nTo change the install prefix you will need to re-compile luakit (after a\n`make clean`) with the following option:\n\n    make PREFIX=/usr\n    sudo make PREFIX=/usr install\n\n## Use Luakit\n\nJust run:\n\n    luakit [URI..]\n\nOr to see the full list of luakit launch options run:\n\n    luakit -h\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration options are endless, the entire browser is constructed by\nthe config files present in `/etc/xdg/luakit`\n\nThere are several files of interest:\n\n * rc.lua      -- is the main config file which dictates which and in what\n                  order different parts of the browser are loaded.\n * theme.lua   -- change fonts and colours used by the interface widgets.\n\nJust copy the files you wish to change (and the rc.lua) into\n`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/luakit` (defaults to `~/.config/luakit/`) and luakit will\nuse those files when you next launch it.\n\nThe following files used to be configuration files, but are not anymore:\n\n * binds.lua      -- is now a built-in module providing the default bindings.\n                     Bindings should be changed with the `modes` APIs.\n * modes.lua      -- is now a built-in module providing built-in modes, as well\n                     as providing APIs to manage bindings within those modes.\n * window.lua     -- is now a built-in module.\n * webview.lua    -- is now a built-in module.\n * webview_wm.lua -- is now a built-in module.\n * globals.lua    -- global settings have been moved to other modules.\n\nThese files will be silently ignored on startup so as to prevent errors; users\nwishing to override the built-in modules should change `package.path`.\n\n## HiDPI Monitor Configuration\n\nIf you have a HiDPI monitor (> 1920x1080) and find that web pages are too small,\nyou can change the `webview.zoom_level` on the settings page (luakit://settings/)\nto 150 or 200 as per your taste.\n\n## Uninstall\n\nTo delete luakit from your system run:\n\n    sudo make uninstall\n\nIf you installed with a custom prefix remember to add the identical prefix\nhere also, example:\n\n    sudo make PREFIX=/usr uninstall\n\n## Reporting Bugs\n\nPlease use the bug tracker at:\n\n  https://github.com/luakit/luakit/issues\n\n## IRC\n\nJoin us in `#luakit` on the `irc.oftc.net` network.\n"
