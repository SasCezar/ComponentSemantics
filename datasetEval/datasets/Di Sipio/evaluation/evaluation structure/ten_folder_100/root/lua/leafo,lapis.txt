b'# Lapis\n\nA web framework for Lua/[MoonScript][1] supporting [OpenResty](https://openresty.org/en/) or [http.server](https://github.com/daurnimator/lua-http)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leafo/lapis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leafo/lapis)\n\n[![Twitch Link](http://leafo.net/dump/twitch-banner.svg)](https://www.twitch.tv/moonscript)\n\nLapis is production ready, use it on your next huge project.\n\nLearn more on the homepage: <http://leafo.net/lapis/>\n\n* [Getting Started Tutorial](http://leafo.net/lapis/reference/getting_started.html)\n* [Documentation](http://leafo.net/lapis/reference.html)\n* [Changelog](http://leafo.net/lapis/changelog.html)\n\n## Join Our Community\n\nWe just created a Discord for Lapis users and those interested in it to communicate.

There are three separate test suites:\n\n* `busted` -- test Lua implementations\n* `busted spec_postgres` -- integration tests with PostgreSQL. Requires a running PostgreSQL server\n* `busted spec_mysql` -- integration tests with MySQL. Requires a running MySQL server\n* `busted spec_openresty/` -- integration tests with OpenResty as a server. Requires installation of OpenResty & Databases\n* `busted spec_cqueues/` -- integration tests with [lua-http](https://github.com/daurnimator/lua-http) and cqueues as a server.\n\nTest suites that require databases need to have the initial database created. A `lapis_test` database is created on each.\nYou can run each command respectively.\n\n```bash\nmake test_db # postgres test db\nmake mysql_test_db\n```\n\n* **PostgreSQL**: Ensure the `postgres` user can be logged in with no password.\n* **MySQL**: Ensure the `root` user can be logged in with no password.\n\n### Using the Docker image\n\nThis repository contains a\n[Dockerfile](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/blob/master/Dockerfile) for running\nthe entire test suite. You can it with the following commands:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t lapis-test .\ndocker run lapis-test\n```\n\n`docker build` will pull in the files in the current directory, including any\nchanges. To test modified code, build again before running the test suite. It\nshould be a quick operation since dependency installation is cached.\n\n## License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (C) 2018 by Leaf Corcoran\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
