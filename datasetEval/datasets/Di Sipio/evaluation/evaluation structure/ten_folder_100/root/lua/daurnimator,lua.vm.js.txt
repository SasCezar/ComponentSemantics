b'\nlua.vm.js\n=========\n\nThe Lua VM, on the Web\n\nOnline demo: http://daurnimator.github.io/lua.vm.js/lua.vm.js.html\n\n\nStatus\n======\n\nThis began as an experiment to see how fast the Lua VM can run on the web.\nThat was successful (performance is quite good in both firefox and chrome).\n\nNext step is to iterate on the Lua <=> JS interoperability.\nClever solutions to the lack of finalisers in Javascript are being searched for.\n\n\nBuilding\n========\n\nTo build, run `make emscripten` in the `lua` subdirectory\n\n\nUsage from NodeJS\n=================\n\n    $ npm install lua.vm.js\n\nAnd inside your script:\n\n    var LuaVM = require(\'lua.vm.js\');\n\n    var l = new LuaVM.Lua.State();\n    l.execute(\'print("Hello, world")\');\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nThis project is MIT/X11 licensed.
