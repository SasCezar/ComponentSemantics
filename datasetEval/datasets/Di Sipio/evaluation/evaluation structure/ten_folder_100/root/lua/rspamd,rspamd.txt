Each message is analysed by Rspamd and given a `spam score`.\n\nAccording to this spam score and the user\'s settings, Rspamd recommends an action for\nthe MTA to apply to the message, for example, to pass, reject or add a header.\nRspamd is designed to process hundreds of messages per second simultaneously, and provides a number of\nuseful features.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nA good starting point to study how to install and configure Rspamd is [the quick start guide](https://rspamd.com/doc/quickstart.html).\n\nRspamd is [packaged](https://rspamd.com/downloads.html) for the major Linux distributions, and is also available via [FreeBSD ports](https://freshports.org/mail/rspamd), NetBSD [pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.org) and [OpenBSD ports](http://openports.se/mail/rspamd).\n\nYou can also watch some [videos about Rspamd](https://rspamd.com/media.html).\n\n## Spam filtering features\n\nRspamd is shipped with various spam filtering modules and features enabled just out of the box.\nThe full list of built-in modules could be found in the [Rspamd documentation](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/).\n\nIf that is not enough, Rspamd provides an extensive [Lua API](https://rspamd.com/doc/lua/) to write your own rules and plugins: <https://rspamd.com/doc/tutorials/writing_rules.html>\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on the process for submitting pull requests to us.\n\n## Authors\n\n* **Vsevolod Stakhov** - [vstakhov](https://github.com/vstakhov)\n\nSee also the list of [contributors](AUTHORS.md) who participated in this project.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details\n\n## References\n\n* Home site: <https://rspamd.com>\n* Development: <https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd>\n* Site repository: <https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd.com>\n'
