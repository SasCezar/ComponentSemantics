At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine.\n\nWhat gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user. With these, you can write Lua scripts to control many aspects of your OS X environment.\n\n## How do I install it?\n\n * Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/releases/latest)\n * Drag `Hammerspoon.app` from your `Downloads` folder to `Applications`\n\n## What next?\n\nOut of the box, Hammerspoon does nothing - you will need to create `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua` and fill it with useful code. There are several resources which can help you:\n * [Getting Started Guide](http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/)\n * [API docs](http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/)\n * [FAQ](http://www.hammerspoon.org/faq/)\n * [Sample Configurations](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/wiki/Sample-Configurations) supplied by various users\n * [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for developers looking to get involved\n * An IRC channel for general chat/support/development (#hammerspoon on Freenode) with [searchable archives](https://botbot.me/freenode/hammerspoon/)\n * [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hammerspoon/) for support\n\n## What is the history of the project?\n\nHammerspoon is a fork of [Mjolnir](https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir) by Steven Degutis. Mjolnir aims to be a very minimal application, with its extensions hosted externally and managed using a Lua package manager. We wanted to provide a more integrated experience.\n\n## What is the future of the project?\n\nOur intentions for Hammerspoon broadly fall into these categories:\n * Ever wider coverage of system APIs in Extensions\n * Tighter integration between extensions\n * Smoother user experience\n'
