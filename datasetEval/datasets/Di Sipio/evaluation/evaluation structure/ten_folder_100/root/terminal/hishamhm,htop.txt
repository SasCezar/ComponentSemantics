It is developed primarily on Linux,\nbut we also have code for running under FreeBSD and Mac OS X\n(help and testing are wanted for these platforms!)\n\nThis software has evolved considerably over the years,\nand is reasonably complete, but there is always room for improvement.\n\nComparison between `htop` and classic `top`\n-------------------------------------------\n\n* In `htop` you can scroll the list vertically and horizontally\n  to see all processes and full command lines.\n* In `top` you are subject to a delay for each unassigned\n  key you press (especially annoying when multi-key escape\n  sequences are triggered by accident).\n* `htop` starts faster (`top` seems to collect data for a while\n  before displaying anything).\n* In `htop` you don't need to type the process number to\n  kill a process, in `top` you do.\n* In `htop` you don't need to type the process number or\n  the priority value to renice a process, in `top` you do.\n* In `htop` you can kill multiple processes at once.\n* `top` is older, hence, more tested.\n\nCompilation instructions\n------------------------\n\nThis program is distributed as a standard autotools-based package.\nSee the [INSTALL](/INSTALL) file for detailed instructions.\n\nWhen compiling from a [release tarball](https://hisham.hm/htop/releases/), run:\n\n    ./configure && make\n\nFor compiling sources downloaded from the Git repository, run:\n\n    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make\n\nBy default `make install` will install into `/usr/local`, for changing\nthe path use `./configure --prefix=/some/path`.\n\nSee the manual page (`man htop`) or the on-line help ('F1' or 'h'\ninside `htop`) for a list of supported key commands.\n\nIf not all keys work check your curses configuration.\n\n## License\n\nGNU General Public License, version 2 (GPL-2.0)\n"
