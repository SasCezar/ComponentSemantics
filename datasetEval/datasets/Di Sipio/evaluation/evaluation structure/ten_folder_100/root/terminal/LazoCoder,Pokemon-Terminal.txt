When the command completes, it\'s installed and ready to go!\n\n## pip (Per-User)\n\nYou can install it with pip for a single user with `pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/LazoCoder/Pokemon-Terminal.git`. You might want to add `~/.local/bin` on Linux and macOS or `%AppData%\\Python\\Python3X\\Scripts` (replace X by the minor Python version you are running. For example, Python 3.7 users will want `Python37`) on Windows to your PATH to be able to call `pokemon` and `ichooseyou` everywhere.\n\n## npm (Per-User)\n\nYou can install in any (npm-supported) OS using `npm install --global pokemon-terminal`. That\'s it, you\'re done!\n\nMake sure you also have Python installed, `npm` won\'t automagically do that for you.\n\n## Distutils (System-wide)\n\nYou can clone or [download](https://github.com/LazoCoder/Pokemon-Terminal/archive/master.zip) this repo, and run `sudo python3 setup.py install` on Linux and macOS or `py -3 setup.py install` with administrator permissions on Windows at the root of the repo.\n\n# Usage\n\n```\nusage: pokemon [-h] [-n NAME]\n               [-r [{kanto,johto,hoenn,sinnoh,unova,kalos} [{kanto,johto,hoenn,sinnoh,unova,kalos} ...]]]\n               [-l [0.xx]] [-d [0.xx]]\n               [-t [{normal,fire,fighting,water,flying,grass,poison,electric,ground,psychic,rock,ice,bug,dragon,ghost,dark,steel,fairy} [{normal,fire,fighting,water,flying,grass,poison,electric,ground,psychic,rock,ice,bug,dragon,ghost,dark,steel,fairy} ...]]]\n               [-ne] [-e] [-ss [X]] [-w] [-v] [-dr] [-c]\n               [id]\n\nSet a pokemon to the current terminal background or wallpaper\n\npositional arguments:\n  id                    Specify the wanted pokemon ID or the exact (case\n                        insensitive) name\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -c, --clear           Clears the current pokemon from terminal background\n                        and quits.\n\nFilters:\n  Arguments used to filter the list of pokemons with various conditions that\n  then will be picked\n\n  -n NAME, --name NAME  Filter by pokemon which name contains NAME\n  -r [{kanto,johto,hoenn,sinnoh,unova,kalos} [{kanto,johto,hoenn,sinnoh,unova,kalos} ...]], --region [{kanto,johto,hoenn,sinnoh,unova,kalos} [{kanto,johto,hoenn,sinnoh,unova,kalos} ...]]\n                        Filter the pokemons by region\n  -l [0.xx], --light [0.xx]\n                        Filter out the pokemons darker (lightness threshold\n                        lower) then 0.xx (default is 0.7)\n  -d [0.xx], --dark [0.xx]\n                        Filter out the pokemons lighter (lightness threshold\n                        higher) then 0.xx (default is 0.42)\n  -t [{normal,fire,fighting,water,flying,grass,poison,electric,ground,psychic,rock,ice,bug,dragon,ghost,dark,steel,fairy} [{normal,fire,fighting,water,flying,grass,poison,electric,ground,psychic,rock,ice,bug,dragon,ghost,dark,steel,fairy} ...]], --type [{normal,fire,fighting,water,flying,grass,poison,electric,ground,psychic,rock,ice,bug,dragon,ghost,dark,steel,fairy} [{normal,fire,fighting,water,flying,grass,poison,electric,ground,psychic,rock,ice,bug,dragon,ghost,dark,steel,fairy} ...]]\n                        Filter the pokemons by type.\n  -ne, --no-extras      Excludes extra pokemons (from the extras folder)\n  -e, --extras          Excludes all non-extra pokemons\n\nMisc:\n  -ss [X], --slideshow [X]\n                        Instead of simply choosing a random pokemon from the\n                        filtered list, starts a slideshow (with X minutes of\n                        delay between pokemon) in the background with the\n                        pokemon that matched the filters\n  -w, --wallpaper       Changes the desktop wallpaper instead of the terminal\n                        background\n  -v, --verbose         Enables verbose output\n  -dr, --dry-run        Implies -v and doesn\'t actually changes either\n                        wallpaper or background after the pokemon has been\n                        chosen\n\nNot setting any filters will get a completely random pokemon\n```\n\nExample:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DfA2lcd.gif)\n\n# Tips, tricks and common issues\n\n## iTerm2 settings\n\nI highly suggest making the font colors black and the terminal window transparent. Some of the images have both light and dark colours and so it can be difficult to see the text sometimes. Transparency resolves this issue. Since *Pokemon-Terminal* only changes the background, the transparency must be done manually:\n\n1. Navigate to iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > Window\n2. Set the transparency to about half way.\n3. Hit the "blur" checkbox.\n4. Set the blur to maximum.\n5. Optionally you can set the blending to maximum to adjust the colors to look like the samples provided.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xSZAGhL.png)\n\nThe result should look like this:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/82DAT97.jpg)\n\n## ConEmu settings\n\n1. From the menu under the symbol at left of title bar, navigate to Settings > Main > Background\n2. Set Darkening to maximum (255).\n3. Set Placement to Stretch.\n4. Click Save Settings.\n5. Optionally you apply transparency under Features > Transparency.\n\n## Adding Custom Images\n\nThe folder `pokemonterminal/Images/Extra` is for adding custom images. You can manually add backgrounds to this folder and they will be visible to the program. Only JPG format is supported. To see a list of all the custom backgrounds type:\n```bash\n$ pokemon -e -dr\n```\nAlternatively, you can delete images from this folder and it will not break the program. These are some custom backgrounds:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gdGUucu.gif)\n\n## Solutions for Common Issues\n\n* If you experience a line at the top of the terminal after changing the Pokemon, you can remove it by typing in the `clear` command or opening a new terminal.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5HMu1jD.png)\n\n* If you are using Tilix and the terminal background is not changing, try adjusting the transparency in your profile settings.\n* If you are experiencing issues with Terminology and are running on Ubuntu, make sure that you have installed the latest version:\n   ```bash\n   $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:niko2040/e19\n   $ sudo apt-get update\n   $ sudo apt install terminology\n   ```\n\n## Saving\n\n### iTerm2\nI have not yet implemented a way to save the terminal background to a profile. To save a background you will need to setup a startup command in the profile.\n1. Navigate to iTerm2 > Preferences > General\n2. Locate the field where it says *Send text at start* under *Command*.\n3. In that field type `pokemon -n [pokemon name]`. You can see an example in the image down below.\n   - Alternatively you can also type `pokemon` for a random theme each time you open up a new terminal.\n4. You can leave out `; clear` if you don\'t care about the line showing up at the top of the terminal.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2d4qa9j.png)\n\n### ConEmu\nAfter setting your desired pokemon, from the menu under the symbol at left of title bar, navigate to Settings > Main > Background and click Save Settings.\n\n### Terminology\nTerminology already saves it automatically, just untick "temporary" in the settings after setting your desired Pokemon:\n![](http://i.imgur.com/BTqYXKa.png)\n\nTo show a random Pokemon each session:\n1. Open `~/.bashrc` in your favorite text editor.\n2. Add the following lines to it:\n   ```bash\n   if [[ "$TERMINOLOGY" -eq "1" ]]; then\n       pokemon\n   fi\n   ```\nThat will simply pick a completely random Pokemon each session, but the `pokemon` line is simply calling the app, so you can still filter with regions, darkness, and etc. like you normally would, or you can also reset to a preset Pokemon every time you start.\n\n# Notes & Credits\n\n- Nearly all of the Pokemon backgrounds were created by [Teej](https://pldh.net/gallery/the493).\n- Originally the images were about 100mb in total but [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) was used to compress them down to about 17mb.\n- Since the images are compressed, some of them may have some mild (but negligible) compression artifacts.\n- Thanks to [@DrMartinLutherXing](https://github.com/DrMartinLutherXing) for some bug fixes.\n- Thanks to [@joanbono](https://github.com/joanbono) for the easy installation script in the readme.\n- Thanks to [@BnMcG](https://github.com/BnMcG) for the region specific randomize function.\n- Thanks to [@samosaara](https://github.com/samosaara) for the Linux (GNOME and Terminology) port.\n- Thanks to [@sylveon](https://github.com/sylveon) for maintaining the AUR package.\n- Thanks to [@therealklanni](https://github.com/therealklanni) for adding the project to npm.\n- Thanks to [@MattMattV](https://github.com/MattMattV) for adding Tilix support.\n- Thanks to [@connordinho](https://github.com/connordinho) for enhancing the slideshow functionality.\n- Thanks to [@cclauss](https://github.com/cclauss) for simplifying the code in the database class and the main class.\n- Thanks to [@Fiskie](https://github.com/Fiskie) for implementing the adapter design pattern, piping commands and more.\n- Thanks to [@marcobiedermann](https://github.com/marcobiedermann) for better image compression.\n- Thanks to [@kamil157](https://github.com/kamil157) and [@dosman711](https://github.com/dosman711) for the randomized slideshow function.\n- Thanks to [@Squirrels](https://github.com/Squirrels) for adding Pokemon from the Unova and Kalos regions.\n- Thanks to [@caedus75](https://github.com/caedus75) for pip and reorganizing the files & folders.\n'
