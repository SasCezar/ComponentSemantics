Project had [lost maintainer](https://github.com/railsware/upterm/issues/1301#issue-327003344) and have zero activity to support it from community (only issues was created in repo).\n\nI am no longer accepting pull requests and issues.\n\nI recomended to check [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) instead.\n\nWhat Is It?\n-----------\n\n**[Upterm is looking for maintainers](https://github.com/railsware/upterm/issues/1301)**\n\nUpterm (formerly Black Screen) is an IDE in the world of terminals. Strictly speaking, it's both a\nterminal emulator and an *interactive* shell based on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).\n\n![](README/main.png)\n\n###### Autocompletion\n\nUpterm shows the autocompletion box as you type and tries to be smart about what to suggest.\nOften you can find useful additional information on the right side of the autocompletion, e.g. expanded alias value,\ncommand descriptions, value of the previous directory (`cd -`), etc.\n\n###### Compatibility\n\nAll command-line programs (including emacs, ssh and vim) should work as expected. If you experience any glitches, please [create an issue](https://github.com/railsware/upterm/issues/new).\n\nInstall\n------------\n\n###### MacOS\n\n```bash\nbrew cask install upterm\n```\n\nBeware that the version in Homebrew might be outdated. Visit the [releases](https://github.com/railsware/upterm/releases) page to download the latest version.\n\n###### Linux *(Arch Linux)*\n```bash\nyaourt -S upterm\n```\n\nAs with macOS's `brew` install, the AUR may also be outdated.
