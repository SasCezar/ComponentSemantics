The Tilix web site for users is available at [https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web).\n\n###### Screenshot\n![Screenshot](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/assets/images/gallery/tilix-screenshot-1.png)\n\n### About\n\nTilix is a tiling terminal emulator which uses the VTE GTK+ 3 widget with the following features:\n\n* Layout terminals in any fashion by splitting them horizontally or vertically\n* Terminals can be re-arranged using drag and drop both within and between windows\n* Terminals can be detached into a new window via drag and drop\n* Tabs or sidebar list current sessions\n* Input can be synchronized between terminals so commands typed in one terminal are replicated to the others\n* The grouping of terminals can be saved and loaded from disk\n* Terminals support custom titles\n* Color schemes are stored in files and custom color schemes can be created by simply creating a new file\n* Transparent background\n* Background images\n* [Quake mode](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix/wiki/Quake-Mode) support (i.e. drop-down terminal)\n* Custom hyperlinks\n* Automatic (triggered) profile switches based on hostname and directory\n* Supports notifications when processes are completed out of view. Requires the Fedora notification patches for VTE\n* Experimental trigger support (Requires patched VTE, see [wiki](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix/wiki/Automatic-(Triggered)-Profile-Switching))\n* Experimental badge support (Requires patched VTE, see [wiki](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix/wiki/Badges))\n\nThe application was written using GTK 3 and an effort was made to conform to GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG). As a result, it does use CSD (i.e. the GTK HeaderBar) though it can be disabled if necessary. Other than GNOME, only Unity has been tested officially though users have had success with other desktop environments.\n\n### Migrating Settings From Terminix\n\nTerminix was recently re-named to Tilix and as a result the settings key changed. To migrate your settings to Tilix, please perform the following steps:\n\n```\ndconf dump /com/gexperts/Terminix/ > terminix.dconf\ndconf load /com/gexperts/Tilix/ < terminix.dconf\n```\nThis will export your settings from the Terminix key in dconf and re-import them into the Tilix key.\n\nNote that this will work even after you have uninstalled the Terminix schema, since the user customized settings are available even after the schema got removed, and the default settings are identical between the two and thus do not matter.\n\nOnce you have imported the settings and everything is ok you can clear the old Terminix settings with:\n```\ndconf reset -f /com/gexperts/Terminix/\n```\nFinally to copy the bookmarks and custom themes just do:\n\n```\nmv ~/.config/terminix ~/.config/tilix\n```\n\n### Dependencies\n\nTilix requires the following libraries to be installed in order to run:\n* GTK 3.18 or later (Tilix 1.8.3 or later, earlier versions supported GTK 3.14)\n* GTK VTE 0.42 or later\n* dconf\n* GSettings\n* [Nautilus-Python](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NautilusPython) (Required for Nautilus integration)\n\n### Support\n\nIf you are having issues with Tilix, feel free to open issues here in github as necessary. Developers and users can  also be found on IRC on the [freenode](https://freenode.net) network in the #tilix room.\n\n### Localization\n\nTilix is localized using Weblate, please visit the Weblate hosted [Tilix translations site](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/tilix/translations) in order to assist with translations, please do not submit direct pull requests to this repository for translations.\n\n### Building\n\nTilix is written in [D](https://dlang.org/) and GTK 3 using the gtkd framework. This project uses dub to manage the build process including fetching the dependencies, thus there is no need to install dependencies manually. The only thing you need to install to build the application is the D tools (compiler and Phobos) along with dub itself. Note that D supports three [compilers](https://wiki.dlang.org/Compilers) (DMD, GDC and LDC) but Tilix only supports DMD and LDC.\n\nOnce you have those installed, compiling the application is a one line command as follows:\n\n```\ndub build --build=release\n```\n\nThe application depends on various resources to function correctly, run `sudo ./install.sh` to build and copy all of the resources to the correct locations. Note this has only been tested on Arch Linux, use with caution.\nNote : `install.sh` will install Tilix to your `/usr` directory. If you are interested in installing Tilix to a custom location, you can specify the `PREFIX` as an argument to the `install.sh` script (e.g : `./install.sh $HOME/.local` will install Tilix into `$HOME/.local`). However, this requires you to add your `$PREFIX/share` directory to your `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` environment variable.\n\nNote there is also support for meson, please see the wiki page on [meson](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix/wiki/Building-with-Meson) for more information.\n\nSupport for autotools will be deprecated in favor of meson, for information on using autotools please see the wiki page [here](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix/wiki/Building-with-Autotools).\n\n#### Build Dependencies\n\nTilix depends on the following libraries as defined in dub.json:\n* [gtkd](http://gtkd.org/) >= 3.8.2\n* gdk-pixbuf-pixdata (Used when building resource file)\n\n### Install Tilix\n\nTilix is available as [packages](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/#packages) for a variety of distributions.\n\n#### Uninstall Tilix\n\nThis method only applies if you installed Tilix manually using the install instructions. If you installed Tilix from a distribution package then use your package manager to remove tilix, do not use these instructions.\n\nDownload the uninstall.sh script from this repository and then open a terminal (not Tilix!) in the directory where you saved it. First set the executable flag on the script:\n\n```\nchmod +x uninstall.sh\n```\n\nand then execute it:\n\n```\nsudo sh uninstall.sh\n```\n'
