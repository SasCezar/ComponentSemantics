Zero was written for fun and to push JavaScript performance. ASCII rendering has been tested on Windows, OSX and Linux terminals. ANSI 24-bit true color rendering has been tested on Cygwin (Windows) and Linux Mint terminals, but should work on most terminals that support true color.\n\nThis project and associative materials are offered as is to anyone who may find them of use.\n\nZero implements:\n- Programmable Vertex and Fragment shaders (in JavaScript)\n- Perspective Z-Correct Texture Mapping\n- Per Pixel Depth Buffering\n- Adaptive Resolution on Terminal resize (TTY only)\n- Support for 24bit true color (terminal must support 24-bit color)\n- Matrix and Vector math libraries.\n- A Scene Graph\n\nLicence MIT\n\n### Building Locally\n\nClone this project and run the following from the terminal.\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n$ npm run build\n# run it\n$ node index\n```\n\n\n\n"
