b'**wego** is a weather client for the terminal.\n\n![Screenshots](http://schachmat.github.io/wego/wego.gif)\n\n## Features\n\n* show forecast for 1 to 7 days\n* nice ASCII art icons\n* displayed info (metric or imperial units):\n  * temperature range ([felt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_chill) and measured)\n  * windspeed and direction\n  * viewing distance\n  * precipitation amount and probability\n* ssl, so the NSA has a harder time learning where you live or plan to go\n* multi language support\n* config file for default location which can be overridden by commandline\n* Automatic config management with [ingo](https://github.com/schachmat/ingo)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* A [working](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing) [Go](https://golang.org/)\n  [1.5](https://golang.org/doc/go1.5) environment (You can use\n  [goenv](https://github.com/pwoolcoc/goenv) if your distribution does not\n  support Go 1.5 yet)\n* utf-8 terminal with 256 colors\n* A sane monospaced font containing all the required runes (I use `dejavu sans\n  mono`)\n* An API key for the backend (see Setup below)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install or update the wego binary into your `$GOPATH` as usual, run:\n```shell\ngo get -u github.com/schachmat/wego\n```\n\n## Setup\n\n0. Run `wego` once. You will get an error message, but the `.wegorc` config file\n   will be generated in your `$HOME` directory (it will be hidden in some file\n   managers due to the filename starting with a dot).\n0. __With a [forecast.io](http://forecast.io/) account__ (new default)\n    * Create your account on https://developer.forecast.io/register\n    * Update the following `.wegorc` config variables to fit your needs:\n    ```\n      backend=forecast.io\n      location=40.748,-73.985\n      forecast-api-key=YOUR_FORECAST.IO_API_KEY_HERE\n    ```\n0. __With an [Openweathermap](https://home.openweathermap.org/) account__\n    * You can create an account and get a free API key by [signing up](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)\n    * Update the following `.wegorc` config variables to fit your needs:\n    ```\n      backend=openweathermap\n      location=New York\n      owm-api-key=YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY_HERE\n    ```\n0. __With a [Worldweatheronline](http://www.worldweatheronline.com/) account__\n    * Worldweatheronline no longer gives out free API keys. [#83](https://github.com/schachmat/wego/issues/83)\n    * Update the following `.wegorc` config variables to fit your needs:\n    ```\n      backend=worldweatheronline\n      location=New York\n      wwo-api-key=YOUR_WORLDWEATHERONLINE_API_KEY_HERE\n    ```\n0. You may want to adjust other preferences like `days`, `units` and `\xe2\x80\xa6-lang` as\n   well. Save the file.\n0. Run `wego` once again and you should get the weather forecast for the current\n   and next few days for your chosen location.\n0. If you\'re visiting someone in e.g. London over the weekend, just run `wego 4\n   London` or `wego London 4` (the ordering of arguments makes no difference) to\n   get the forecast for the current and the next 3 days. Unfortunately that does\n   not currently work with the forecast.io backend, as it only supports\n   latitude,longitude location specification.\n\nYou can set the `$WEGORC` environment variable to override the default config\nfile location.\n\n## Todo\n\n* more [backends and frontends](https://github.com/schachmat/wego/wiki/How-to-write-a-new-backend-or-frontend)\n* resolve ALL the [issues](https://github.com/schachmat/wego/issues)\n* don\'t forget the [TODOs in the code](https://github.com/schachmat/wego/search?q=TODO&type=Code)\n\n## License - ISC\n\nCopyright (c) 2014-2017,  <teichm@in.tum.de>\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose\nwith or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice\nand this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH\nREGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS.
