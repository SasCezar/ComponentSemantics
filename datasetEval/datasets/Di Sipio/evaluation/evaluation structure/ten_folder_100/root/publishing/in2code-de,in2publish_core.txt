As an editor you can see all changes\nat a glance and publish them. Changes of major revisions can be prepared and approved individually.\nPages and related content and files are reliably transferred as well.\nYou can also publish selected page trees to the live server.\n\nEditing pages can be structured into a multi-step workflow, thus editing, reviewing, and publishing can be separated into distinct roles.\nThe modern user interface facilitates intuitive handling without excessive training.\n\n### Questions\n\nIf you have questions **please** have a look at the [FAQs](Documentation/FAQ.md) first. If your question is not listed try to find your answer in the documentation.\nYou can ask questions (no support!) in the #ext-in2publish Slack channel on typo3.slack.com but there is no warranty.\nIf you need support you can [contact in2code](https://www.in2code.de/en/).\n\n### Technical note\n\nThe content publisher basically requires two TYPO3 instances. A staging and a live instance.\nEditors work solely on the stage server. They also have a backend module to manage pages and files and their publishing status.\nThis means that backend access to the live server is not required anymore. The data transfer between\nthe two servers is secured by encrypted connections and allows only unidirectional system access from stage to live.\n\nData from the live server is only transferred upon explicit request from the stage server. This also means\nthat the stage server can be placed inside the private company intranet while the live server is accessible\nthroughout the internet. The same TYPO3 extension is installed on both servers. So both servers only differ\nin configuration. This has the great advantage that an existing deployment can be used for both systems at once.\n\nSee for more details:\n* https://www.in2code.de/produkte/content-publisher/ (german)\n* https://www.in2code.de/fileadmin/content/downloads/in2code_content_publisher_en.pdf (english)\n\n### Screenshots\n\n\n<img src="https://www.in2code.de/fileadmin/content/images/produkte/contentpublisher/content_publisher_screenshot04_prev.png" width="600" />\n\nExample overview module with details\n\n\n<img src="https://box.everhelper.me/attachment/915974/84725fb7-0b3e-4c40-b52e-29d7620777bb/262407-BasbtZAplLd9ZICI/screen.png" width="600" />\n\nSide by side comparison between stage and live\n\n\n<img src="https://box.everhelper.me/attachment/915967/84725fb7-0b3e-4c40-b52e-29d7620777bb/262407-51SodD2DusbJ5WS4/screen.png" width="600" />\n\nInstallation support by a lot of tests\n\n\n<img src="https://box.everhelper.me/attachment/915965/84725fb7-0b3e-4c40-b52e-29d7620777bb/262407-5nHfdlwJ6tLNPxBi/screen.png" width="600" />\n\nExample workflow module (part of the enterprise version)\n\n\n<img src="https://www.in2code.de/fileadmin/content/images/produkte/contentpublisher/content_publisher_screenshot03_prev.png" width="600" />\n\nExample workflow feature (part of the enterprise version)\n\n\n<img src="https://box.everhelper.me/attachment/915970/84725fb7-0b3e-4c40-b52e-29d7620777bb/262407-93UtQ9cPeb0NCY1e/screen.png" width="600" />\n\nBrowser notifications after asynchronous publishing (part of the enterprise version)\n\n## Installation\n\n`composer require in2code/in2publish_core`\n\nEasy installation via composer.
