[Pressbooks](https://pressbooks.org) is built on top of\n[WordPress Multisite](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#multisite), and makes\nsignificant changes to:\n\n* admin interface (customized for books and other structured documents, such as\n  magazines, journals, reports, etc.);\n* web presentation layer (again, customized for books and structured documents);\n  and\n* export routines.\n\nPressbooks is free software, released under the\n[GPL v3.0 or later](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/blob/master/LICENSE.md) license.\n\nOur web/ebook and [PDF][pdf] exports are all driven by HTML + CSS. XML outputs have\nno styling.\n\n[pdf]: https://docraptor.com/blog/docraptor-vs-princexml/ "Note: we use the non-free software PrinceXML for PDF export."\n\n## Important!\n\n* Do **_NOT_** use Pressbooks with an existing WordPress site.\n* Please use with a **_FRESH_** install of\n  [WP **_MULTISITE_**](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#multisite).\n* If this makes you nervous, please use our free site:\n  [Pressbooks](https://pressbooks.com), or contact us.\n\n## Try pressbooks.com\n\nWhile Pressbooks is open source, we recommend you try\n[Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com) before deciding whether or not you wish\nto host and maintain your own instance.
