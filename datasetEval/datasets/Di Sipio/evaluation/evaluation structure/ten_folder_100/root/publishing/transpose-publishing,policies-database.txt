b'# TRANSPOSE journal policies database\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/transpose-publishing/policies-database.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/transpose-publishing/policies-database)\n\nWe\'re crowd-sourcing a database of journal policies relating to peer review (openness, recognition for co-reviewing) and preprinting.\n\n**[\xf0\x9f\x91\x89Edit and add new records to TRANSPOSE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQVQVbwRTFymY1yMMPvHRLzEhlnm0HZ1ZEKvWeNjjbYtvyYuZ4_6eTqrJ0LkQDVF8ASwv62U3uw4V18/pubhtml?gid=1520385021&single=true)**\n\n### Why TRANSPOSE?\n\nWhile there are fantastic databases that indicate whether archiving a preprint is allowed ([Sherpa/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php)) and whether journals are partnered with [Publons](https://publons.com/journal/?order_by=reviews), to our knowledge, there is no database of information on topics such as:\n- the openness of peer review (whether the content of peer reviews and the identities of reviewers are published, or whether reviews can be transferred to other journals), \n- recognition for peer review (whether postdoc co-reviewers are acknowledged), \n- _detailed_ policies on preprinting (for example, what version is ok to post, whether preprints can be cited, and what licenses and media coverage of preprints are permitted).\n\nWithout this kind of information, it\'s difficult to monitor or advocate for changes that would make scholarly publishing more open and fair. It\'s also difficult for authors to easily compare different journals to make choices that support their needs and interests in open communication.\n\nIn order to address this, we\'re building a user-editable database that contains this information. The database entries are human-readable YAML files that we\'ll use to build visualizations on the web down the road.\n\nFor more information on this initiative, visit our [homepage](http://transpose-publishing.github.io).\n\n## Contributing\n\n**[\xf0\x9f\x91\x89Edit and add new records to TRANSPOSE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQVQVbwRTFymY1yMMPvHRLzEhlnm0HZ1ZEKvWeNjjbYtvyYuZ4_6eTqrJ0LkQDVF8ASwv62U3uw4V18/pubhtml?gid=1520385021&single=true)**\n\n## Participation Guidelines\n\nThis project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

(The instructions in the [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n1EeGpJw9sfjHfRyaD5w9zSVp2Opo6oNvYBKGpmYQWM/edit#) refer to an older architecture that we have since replaced with Google Sheets and Google Forms).\n\n### MozSprint\nWe participated in the [Mozilla\'s Global Sprint](http://mzl.la/global-sprint/) on May 10-11, 2018.\n- Find issues we\'re looking for help with labeled "mozsprint" [here](https://github.com/transpose-publishing/policies-database/issues)\n- TRANSPOSE on the Mozilla Global Sprint repo [here](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint/issues/269)\n- We discussed the TRANSPOSE project on a Mozilla Sprint Demo call at 12pm ET (16:00 UTC) on Tuesday, May 8, 2018. [See notes and join info](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ol5-demos-b)\n- During the Sprint, we can keep in touch via Gitter: [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/transpose-publishing/Lobby#)\n\n## Local usage\n\n**(Note: The code in this repository is no longer being used to run TRANSPOSE)**\n\nMost users will not need to run the code in this repository locally.\nHowever, if you\'d like to modify the code or test a change locally, follow these instructions.\n\nThis repository uses [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) to manage its environment as specified in [`environment.yml`](environment.yml).\nInstall the environment with:\n\n```sh\nconda env create --file=environment.yml\n```\n\nThen use `conda activate policies-database` and `conda deactivate` to activate or deactivate the environment.\n\nWith the environment activated, you can validate YAML policy files with the following commands:\n\n```sh\n# Validate a single test YAML policies\npykwalify \\\n  --data-file policies/test-policies/test-policy-id-only.yml \\\n  --schema-file policies/schema.yml\n\n# Validate all YAML files in policies/policies\npytest policies/validate_policies.py\n```\n\n## License\n\nAll original work in this repository is dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 license.\nSee [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).\nSHERPA RoMEO data is reused under its CC BY-NC-SA 2.5 License.\nLearn more in the [`romeo`](romeo) README.\n\n## Data source\n[![Sherpa Romeo](https://github.com/transpose-publishing/transpose-publishing.github.io/blob/master/images/romeosmall.gif)](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/RoMEO.php)\n\nInformation in the policy records is derived from the RoMEO database which is compiled by SHERPA and has been modified for use here.
