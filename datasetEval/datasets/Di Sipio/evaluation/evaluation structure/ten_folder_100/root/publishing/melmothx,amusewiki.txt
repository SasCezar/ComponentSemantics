b'![AmuseWiki](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melmothx/amusewiki/master/doc/design/amw-banner.png)\n\nThis is a wiki engine using the Text::Amuse markup (based on and\nmostly compatible with Emacs Muse) and a Git backend. It can work as a\nread-only site, as a moderated wiki, or as a fully open wiki or even\nas a private site. On a single instance you can run as many sites as you\nwant.\n\nThe application is written in Perl and uses the AmuseWikiFarm\nnamespace (for legacy reason, as its predecessor used the AmuseWiki\nnamespace).\n\nThe application has an extensive test suite. However, **do not run\n`make test` in the production directory**. If you want to run the\ntests, do it in a dedicated checkout, as tests leave a lot of files\nbehind.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe official documentation can be found on https://amusewiki.org\n\nIf for some reason the site is offline you can find the muse source\nfiles in the\n[GitHub repository](https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki-site).\nNotable entries are listed below.\n\n### Install and upgrade\n\n - https://amusewiki.org/library/install or\n   https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki-site/blob/master/i/il/install.muse\n\n - https://amusewiki.org/library/upgrade-amusewiki or\n   https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki-site/blob/master/u/ua/upgrade-amusewiki.muse\n\n### Site setup, customization, user roles, SSL certificates\n\n - https://amusewiki.org/library/roles or\n   https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki-site/blob/master/r/rs/roles.muse\n\n - https://amusewiki.org/library/site-customization or\n   https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki-site/blob/master/s/sc/site-customization.muse\n\n - https://amusewiki.org/library/ssl-certificates-with-lets-encrypt or\n   https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki-site/blob/master/s/sc/ssl-certificates-with-lets-encrypt.muse\n\n### Editing\n\n - User manual for the Muse markup:\n   https://amusewiki.org/library/manual or\n   https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki-site/blob/master/m/ml/manual.muse\n\n - Offline editing with Git:\n   https://amusewiki.org/library/offline-editing-via-git or\n   https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki-site/blob/master/o/oe/offline-editing-via-git.muse\n\n### Localization\n\n - https://amusewiki.org/library/localization or\n   https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki-site/blob/master/l/ln/localization.muse\n\n - https://amusewiki.org/library/translating-the-interface or\n   https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki-site/blob/master/t/tt/translating-the-interface.muse\n\n'
