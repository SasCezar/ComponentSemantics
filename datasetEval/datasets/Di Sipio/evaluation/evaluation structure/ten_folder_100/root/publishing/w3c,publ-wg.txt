Please make branch names informative\xe2\x80\x94by including the issue or bug number for example.\n\nEditorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.\n\n## Tools\n\nGenerating weekly minutes is done via the\n[scribejs](https://github.com/w3c/scribejs) script and some additional\nconfiguration settings provided in this repo (see `.scribejs.json`).\n\nTo use this repository's scribejs setup first install the tools...\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\nThen run the following (with date\ninformation changed to match your scenario):\n\n```bash\n$ npm run scribejs -- -d 2018-07-09 -o Meetings/Minutes/2018/2018-07-09-pwg.md\n```\n\nThis will request the IRC logs for the correct channel and convert them into\nthe Kramdown (a more feature rich form of Markdown) with settings to match this\nrepositories other documents.\n\nIf you need to make edits to the IRC log before generating the output (due to\nincorrect scribenick or similar), you can download the W3C logs from URLs such\nas `https://www.w3.org/2018/07/09-pwg-irc.txt`. Once downloaded, you can\nreference that input document directly (rather than using the automagic\ndate-based retrieval).\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ curl https://www.w3.org/2018/07/09-pwg-irc.txt > 2018-07-09-pwg-irc.txt\n$ npm run scribejs -- 2018-07-09-pwg-irc.txt -d 2018-07-09 -o Meetings/Minutes/2018/2018-07-09-pwg.md\n```\nEdit the .txt file and repeat the `npm run scribejs` line as necessary. Once\nfinished, you can commit the `.md` file and delete the `.txt` file (or keep it\nfor your records).\n"
