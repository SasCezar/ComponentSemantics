The design goal of Ghost CLI was to make it possible to install or update Ghost in a\xc2\xa0single command.\n\nIn order to keep these goals obtainable & maintainable by Ghost's small team, we have a recommended system stack that Ghost-CLI works with, and minimal configuration options.\n\n### Recommended stack\n\nWe officially recommend the stack [described here](https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/) for production installs.\n\nThe team behind Ghost CLI _only_ supports this stack. This restriction is very deliberate, as every additional option for configuration or divergent piece of code required to support an additional environment creates exponential complexity and maintenance overhead.\n\nOur primary focus for the project is ensuring that everyone that uses the recommended system stack is able to **install**, **configure**, **start**, **stop**, **restart**, **update** & **list** their Ghost sites. This includes developing better testing to ensure we are able to prevent regressions, and stabilising the code to ensure that edge cases within the recommended stack are accounted for.\n\nThe secondary focus is on improving the CLI itself. We want to ensure that the UI, configuration options, flags, flows, prompts, messages and other behaviours are working for both manual and programmatic use. This also includes improving the documentation to make it easy to use the tool, discover advanced options & debug any common issues.\n\n**Anything that falls outside of these two areas is not being actively worked on at present.**\n\n## Triaging & prioritisation\n\n- Issues which affect many users with our recommended stack are given first priority\n- Issues which affect small numbers of users are prioritised based on the impact vs the difficulty - i.e. quick fixes will be prioritised, complex issues may be closed and labelled with `later` & `recommended-stack`.\n- Issues around documented & understood environment or configuration issues will be closed and labelled with `known-issue`, users will be directed to the docs & forum.\n- Issues that request modifications in order to support other stacks stack will be closed and labelled with `later` & `other-stack`.\n- Issues proposing new features or enhancements will be labelled as such, and in most cases also closed with `later`.\n\n## Help & Support\n\nWe aren't able to provide support in GitHub, but we do keep track of common issues with the `known-issue` label and regularly update documentation & error messages to be clearer.\n\nThe documentation for Ghost-CLI can be found at https://ghost.org/docs/api/ghost-cli/. Community support can be found in our [forum](https://forum.ghost.org).\n\n\n## Developer Setup (for contributing)\n\n1.
