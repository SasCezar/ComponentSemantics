The focus is on PLOS journals and other open access bioinformatics journals. This repository is home to the analyses for the blog post "[Publication delays at PLOS and 3,475 other journals](http://blog.dhimmel.com/plos-and-publishing-delays/)".\n\nPubmed is the main resource where articles and their dates are retrieved from. Pubmed records are easily accessible using the [Entrez E-utilities API](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/). We also scraped the PLOS website as an orthogonal methodology for article date collection.\n\n**Definitions**: Article *publication time* is the days from acceptance to epublication. Article *acceptance time* is the days for receival to acceptance.\n\n## Publication and acceptance times for all journals since 2014\n\nWe retrieved pubmed records for all articles since 2014. The following datasets descend from this query:\n\n+ [`data/pubmed-since-2104.tsv.gz`](data/pubmed-since-2104.tsv.gz) for a minimally processed table of pubmed records\n+ [`data/pubmed-since-2014-filtered.tsv.gz`](data/pubmed-since-2014-filtered.tsv.gz) for a more processed table of pubmed records where publication and acceptance times were successfully computed.\n+ [`data/pubmed-since-2014-summary.tsv`](data/pubmed-since-2014-summary.tsv) for a table where each row is a journal. For each journal, this table reports the mean, median, max, and min publication and acceptance times as well as number of articles contributing to the calculation. **_Check this resource to avoid throwing your manuscript into a black hole!_**\n\n## Publication and acceptance times for PLOS journals\n\nTwo datasets of PLOS articles and their timestamps were created:\n\n+ [`data/scraped-plos.tsv`](data/scraped-plos.tsv) for receival, acceptance, and publication dates scraped from the PLOS website. This file contains only a small subset of all PLOS articles, but may be more reliable because it is taken directly from the source.\n+ [`data/pubmed-plos.tsv.gz`](data/pubmed-plos.tsv.gz) for scraped pubmed records for PLOS articles.\n'
