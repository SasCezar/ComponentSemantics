b'# CaSILE toolkit\n\nThe CaSILE toolkit is a collection of tools designed to automate book publishing from start to finish. The concept is to take very simple input and turn it into a finished product with as little manual intervention as possible. It transforms plain text document formats and meta data into press ready PDFs, E-Books, and rendered promotional materials.\n\nCaSILE (pronounced like \'castle\') started out life as a submodule called `avadanlik` included inside my book project repositories (avadanl\xc4\xb1k being a Turkish word for toolkit). AS most of the parts revolve around SILE, in my head at least CaSILE became **Caleb\xe2\x80\x99in Avadanl\xc4\xb1\xc4\x9f\xc4\xb1 ile Simon\xe2\x80\x99s Improved Layout Engine**, roughly translating to \xe2\x80\x9cCaleb\'s SILE Toolkit\xe2\x80\x9d. Come to think of it that would have been a simpler way to arrive at the name, but the project has deep Turkish roots so I\'m keeping the "a" in the name name as a nod to its origin.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nCaSILE glues together *a lot* of different tools to build a complete publishing tool chain. Behind the scenes this is messy business. In order to make everything work I\'ve had to use an eclectic variety of software. All of these are open source and available across platforms, but to date I\'ve only used at tested this process **on Linux**. Adapting it to run on Mac OS should be pretty straightforward but Windows support will almost certainly require some monkey business. [Not my circus, not my monkeys][nmcnmm].\n\nAll of the following are utilized in one way or another. Currently the toolkit assumes all the following are present, but as not all of them are used to build all resources it could be possible to make this more selective. For example not having the ray tracing engine would just mean no fancy 3D previews of book covers, but you could still build PDFs and other digital formats. Not having Node would mean no Bible verse format normalization, but you should still be able to build books. Not having ImageMagick would mean no covers, but you could still process the interior of books. On the other hand not having Pandoc would be fatal.\n\n* The [SILE][sile] Typesetter (currently I\'m assuming the git HEAD version) is the workhorse behind most of the text layout.\n* [Pandoc][pandoc] (specifically with [my branch with SILE support][pandocsile]) converts between document types.\n* [ImageMagick][im] handles raster image processing (v7 required).\n* [POVRay][pov] is used to render 3 dimensional visualizations.\n* [Inkscape][inkscape] is used to convert SVG resources into other formats.\n* [PDFTk][pdftk] is used for manipulating PDFs.\n* [Podofo][podofo] is used to do more stuff with PDFs.\n* [Kindlegen][kindlegen] is needed to generate Amazon\'s E-Book formats.\n* [Poppler][poppler] is used to do even more stuff with PDFs.\n* [Zint][zint] generates ISBN barcodes, QR codes, etc.\n* Perl, Python, Lua, Node, Zsh, and a few other language interpreters!\n* Various modules for those languages like `lua-yaml`, `python-ruamel`, `python-isblib`, and `python-pandocfilters`.\n* Up to date versions of assorted shell tools like `jq`, `yq`, `entr`, `bc`, and `sqlite`.\n* The default book templates assume system installed versions of **Hack**, **Libertinus**, and **TeX Gyre** font sets.\n* Some other stuff (run `make dependencies` to check on them)\n\nYou\'ll probably want some other things like a PDF viewer that auto updates on file changes (I recommend [zathura][zathura]), and E-Book reader like [Calibre][calibre] but these would be run yourself and are not directly executed by the toolkit.\n\n### Installation\n\nThe assumed [usage](#usage) is to have your book source code in a **Git** repository and this toolkit as a submodule. Execution can be manually from a command line or automatically using a **Continuous Integration** system on the repository. Installing a copy of CaSILE on your system is not necessary, but has one benefit: all the dependencies will be sorted out for you! For example on Arch Linux you can install using:\n\n```bash\n$ yay -S casile-git\n```\n\n## Status\n\nI\'ve published a number of books this way already and have dozens more in progress. In other wards it Works for Me\xe2\x84\xa2 but at the moment I expect it *only* works for me. These tool started out as just some wiring around one book. Then I worked on another book and copied them over to get started. When I hit book number 3 I realized I should make this more modular and just include in in each of my book projects. About this time I knew I wanted to open source it if it proved useful for more than one _type_ of book. That day came and went. One day I just decided to throw it out there so that it would be easier to explain what I was doing. As such it\'s still pretty much hard coded to my needs and needs some adaption to be more generic before it will be much use to anybody else.\n\nMajor TODO items include:\n\n- [x] Remove hard coded resources specific to [Via Christus Publishers][viachristus] such as logos, default copyright notices, etc.\n- [ ] Contribute the changes from my fork of Pandoc upstream.\n- [x] Make it usable in English (or any language?) instead of having all the options hard coded in Turkish.\n- [ ] Integrate code from my _other_ toolkit that has Bible specific publishing tools.\n- [ ] Add installation packages to resolve package dependencies major distros\n- [ ] Setup a demo book repository\n- [ ] Add CI tests to make sure each make target functions as expected\n\n## Usage\n\n1. (Optionally, see [installation](#installation) notes) Add CaSILE as a submodule to your book project\'s git repository.\n\n    ```bash\n    $ git submodule add -b master https://github.com/alerque/casile.git\n    $ git submodule update --init --remote\n    ```\n\n    Note the `-b master` here tells git you want to track the master branch and update to that whenever it changes. This is what I use for my books while I\'m working on them. When I publish (and want to be able to regenerate the same output again even if the toolkit changes) I commit the current version sha to the book repo and stop tracking the master branch.\n\n2. Include the Makefile from your project\'s Makefile.\n\n   ```makefile\n   include casile/makefile\n   ```\n   Note if you installed a copy of CaSILE on your system and would like to use that instead of a submodule, include it using the system path:\n\n   ```makefile\n   include /usr/share/casile/makefile\n   ```\n\n3. Build whatever resources you need. Assuming you have a book source file `my_book.md` and accompanying meta data at `my_book.yml`, the general syntax for generating resources would be:\n\n        make my_book-<layout>-<options>.<format>\n\n    For example to build the press ready PDF for an Octavo size version:\n\n        make my_book-octavo-cover.pdf\n\n    Or to build a 3D rendering of the front cover at Halfletter size:\n\n        make my_book-halfletter-3d-front.jpg\n\nSee also the [CaSILE demos][demos] repository for a sample book project layout.\n\n### Input\n\nCaSILE makes a number of assumptions about the content of your repository, but how exactly you organize your git repos is still flexible. For example I have some single books in their own repositoryies, some series of books where the repository hold the whole series, others with different books with the same publisher/copyright status lumped together (and worked on in branches), a set of tracts by assorted authors but published together in another repository, etc. CaSILE assumes there is some relation between sources in each repository so granular is going to be better, but do keep things together than share resources. Note that common publisher resources can be shared in another submodule (more documentation on this to come).\n\nA book project would typically consist of at least the following:\n\n* makefile\n* my_book.md\n* my_book.yml\n* my_book-background.png\n\nOptionally books may be split into chapters:\n\n* my_book-chapters/000-preface.md\n* my_book-chapters/001-chapterone.md\n* my_book-chapters/002-chaptertwo.md\n\n### Output\n\nIn return, CaSILE will output\n\n* Press ready PDFs (high resolution, full bleed w/ crop marks) for the specified press format\n  * my_book-a5.pdf\n  * my_book-a5-cover.pdf\n* User friendly PDFs (normal resolution, indexed, hyperlinked) for any specified size\n  * my_book-a4.pdf\n* Promotional images based on the cover\n  * my_book-a5-front_cover.jgp\n  * my_book-square-cover.jpg\n* 3D renderings of finished book\n  * my_book-a5-3d-front.jpg\n  * my_book-a5-3d-back.jpg\n  * my_book-a5-3d-stacks.jpg\n* E-Book formats\n  * my_book.epub\n  * my_book.mobi\n\n### Makefile options\n\n\n#### Project parameters\n\nThese settings apply to the whole project. To override the defaults set them in your project\'s `Makefile` (or a shared include!).\n\n\n* `LANGUAGE` sets the language for localized file names.\n\n    The default is English, so you might run `make book-halfletter-3d-front.png`. Changing this to Turkish:\n\n        LANGUAGE = tr\n\n    will mean the command you run should be `make kitap-a5-3b-on.png` to generate the same resource for a similar project with localized filenames. At this time localizations are only included for Turkish, but they are easy enough to add to your project. Submitting them upstream would also me much appreciated.\n\n* `TARGETS` is a list of all the books in a project.\n\n    By default this is set by scanning the project directory and finding all the Markdown files that have matching YAML meta data files of the same name. This helps dodge things like `README.md` files that are not the focus of the meat of a project. You can manually set this with a list:\n\n        TARGETS = book_1 book_2\n\n    Or perhaps populate it with a list of _all_ markdown files. You don\'t want the extentions here, just the basenames of books to be built:\n\n        TARGETS = $(basename $(wildcard *.md))\n\n* `PROJECT` is the name of the overall project (which might contain several books or other works).\n\n    This defaults to the name of the repository directory. Setting it to some other value is mostly useful if you have values such as `OUTPUTDIR` set to references it in a settings file for your organization but want to override it for a project.\n\n        PROJECT = series_name\n\n* `CASILEDIR` is where CaSILE is located.\n\n    Defaults to theh location of the CaSILE makefile as determined by the last makefile in the loaded list (so if you included it from your makefile, do the include after any others or hard code the location yourself. This can also be used to run a version of CaSILE outside of the current project directory.\n\n* `PROJECTDIR` is where your project is located. Sources will be examined here and the build process will run here.\n\n    Defaults to the location of the project makefile as determined by the first makefile in the loaded list. It is unlikely you would ever want to change this.\n\n* `OUTPUTDIR` determines where published files will be placed.\n\n    Ouput files are first created in the current project directory alongside sources. Optionally CaSILE can \'pubish\' finished resources to some other location.\n\n        OUTPUTDIR = /path/to/pub/$(PROJECT)\n\n    The default is unset so `make publish` will do nothing.\n\n* `INPUTDIR` determines where to check for pre-built resources before getting started.\n\n    This value is not set by default, but the most common usage would be to use the same value as in `OUTPUTDIR`:\n\n        INPUTDIR = $(OUTPUTDIR)\n\n    This will have the effect of copying in files from that location to the project folder before `make` gets started to save the trouble of regenerating files that may already exist and be up to date.\n\n* `FORMATS` contains a list of output formats to build for from each input.\n\n    By default this is set to `pdf epub`, but you may want to build less or more that this. To built "the works":\n\n        FORMATS = pdf epub mobi odt docx app\n\n    Note this only affects the formats that get built by default from the `all` target, you can still build individual resources in any format manually.\n\n* `BLEED` sets the bleed margin for press resources in mm.\n\n    Defaults to 3.\n\n        BLEED = 5\n\n* `TRIM` sets the trim margin for press resources in mm.\n\n    Defaults to 10.\n\n        TRIM = 15\n\n* `PAPERWEIGHT` sets the paperweight (in grams) used to calculate book thickness and hence spine width.\n\n    Defaults to 60.\n\n        PAPERWEIGHT = 80\n\n* `COVERGRAVITY` tells the cover generator what direction to crop background images when adjusting for different aspect ration.\n\n    Defaults to Center. Possible options are anything that ImageMagick understands, so South, SouthWest, NorthEast, etc.\n\n        COVERGRAVITY = North\n\n#### Build time settings\n\nThese settings are usually not changed except at run time. You _may_ set them in your `Makefile` but they would typically be set as environment variables or on the command line to get other-than-default behaviour for a specific build.\n\n* `DRAFT` enables draft mode builds for faster testing.\n\n    This defaults to false, but may be set to true when executing make:\n\n        make DRAFT=true book-a4-binding.pdf\n\n    What this does will depend on the resource type. Books are only typeset in one pass, so TOC\'s may be out of date, cover images are generated at 17th final resolution, 3D renderings are done with partial lighting for faster ray-tracing, etc.\n\n    Note that `make watch ...` automatically enables this mode.\n\n* `DIFF` enables highlighting differences between git branches.\n\n    Defaults to false.\n\n    Note this works in congunction with the `PARENT` variable. When pre-processing the source of books, the current commit will be comared to the branch (or commit) defined by PARENT. Any differences (at the character level) will be marked up using CriticMarkup sytax. Some output formats (notably PDF) will syntax highlight any additions/removals.\n\n* `STATSMONTHS` sets the default time frame to report on activity.\n\n    Defaults to 1.\n\n    At the end of each month I run `make stats` to run a report of all commit activity on the content of books. This computes the current character and word counts and compares them with each previous commit and shows a report crediting the author of that commit. I use this to pay our translators, editors, etc.\n\n    Override with `make STATSMONTHS=2 stats`.\n\n\n* `DEBUG` enables extra output from various programs showing whats going on durring a build.\n\n    Defaults to false, set to true to enable.\n\n    This will be pretty verbose on the console. Shell scripts will run with `set -x`, programs that have them will be run with debug flags turned on, etc.\n\n* `SILEDEBUG` sets the specific parts of the SILE typesetter to debug. See SILE documentation for details.\n\n    Defaults to casile.\n\n        SILEDEBUG = casile insertions frames\n\n    Usage from the command line might be `make DEBUG=true SILEDEBUG=frames book-a4.pdf`.\n\n* `COVERS` can be used to disable generating cover images. Raster image generation can take time, this skips those steps and just assumes no graphical covers are present.\n\n    Defaults to true, set to false to disable.\n\n* `HEAD` sets how many lines of input books to process.\n\n    Default is unset.\n\n    If setting this to an integer, only that many lines of an input book will be processed. This is useful when styling a book. You can work on the first chapter worth of lines and rebuild the book quickly, then turn it off to regenerate the whole book.\n\n        make HEAD=50 book-octavo.pdf\n\n* `SCALE` sets the factor by which to downsample resources while in draft mode.\n\n    Defaults to 17. This brings 1200 dpi print resources down to 70 dpi.\n\n* `HIDPI` sets the output resolution for press resources.\n\n    Defaults to 1200 with scaling for draft mode enabled.\n\n    This may be set to an another value with or without scaling. For example for a one off command you might run:\n\n        make HIDPI=600 book-octavo-binding.pdf\n\n    But to change the project default you might set this in your `Makefile`:\n\n        HIDPI = $(call scale,600)\n\n* `LODPI` is much the same as `HIDPI` but used for regular discribution resources.\n\n    Defaults to 300 with scaling for draft mode enabled.\n\n#### Hooks\n\nThese are functions that can be defined in your project\'s `Makefile` to add additionaly funtionality at various points in the process. You make use either single or multiline syntax as desired, but note the input, output, and variables passed will be the same either way. On the other hand each hook has its own usage so note the context it runs in.\n\n* `pre_sync` and `post_sync` can be used to run an external application before\n\n    Default is unset. The context is a recipie line.\n\n    For example, I use this on my CI server to update an ownCloud share before and after publishing to it:\n\n        pre_sync = owncloudcmd -n -s $(OUTPUTDIR) $(OWNCLOUD) 2>/dev/null\n        post_sync = $(pre_sync)\n\n\n\n[viachristus]: http://yayinlar.viachristus.com/\n[sile]: http://sile-typesetter.org/\n[pandoc]: http://pandoc.org/\n[pandocsile]: https://github.com/alerque/pandoc/tree/sile-2.7.2\n[im]: http://imagemagick.org/\n[pov]: http://www.povray.org/\n[zint]: https://zint.github.io/\n[inkscape]: https://inkscape.org/\n[pdftk]: https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/\n[podofo]: http://podofo.sourceforge.net/\n[poppler]: https://poppler.freedesktop.org/\n[kindlegen]: https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000234621\n[nmcnmm]: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Not+My+Circus%2C+Not+My+Monkeys%22&ia=images\n[zathura]: https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/\n[calibre]: http://calibre-ebook.com/\n[demos]: https://github.com/alerque/casile-demos\n'
