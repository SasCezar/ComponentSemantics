Wink is built on top of the world\'s finest PHP framework [Laravel](https://laravel.com), making it easy for everyone to install and maintain on any cloud platform.\n\n<img src="https://themsaid.com/storage/wink/images/PaKOXK0bck5IrbVohbC6zQGxZr4CG31enOUt5n80.png">\n\n## Installation\n\nWink runs on any Laravel application, it uses a separate database connection and authentication system so that you don\'t have to modify any of your project code.\n\nTo install Wink, require it via Composer:\n\n```sh\ncomposer require writingink/wink\n```\n\nOnce Composer is done, run the following command:\n\n```sh\nphp artisan wink:install\n```\n\nCheck `config/wink.php` and **configure the database connection** wink is going to be using. Then instead of running `php artisan migrate`, run:\n\n```sh\nphp artisan wink:migrate\n```\n\nHead to `yourproject.test/wink` and use the provided email and password to log in.\n\nBefore creating a blog post, make sure you have your image directory set up correctly. The directory is set in the `config/wink.php` and defaults to\n`public/wink/images`. If you are installing Wink in a fresh Laravel install, make sure you link your public directory to the storage directory [https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/filesystem#configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/filesystem#configuration) using this command:\n\n```sh\nphp artisan storage:link\n```\n\n(optional) Visit https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications to create a new unsplash app. Grab the \'Access Key\' and add it to your `.env` file as `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`. Lastly, add unsplash to your `config/services.php` file:\n\n```php\n\'unsplash\' => [\n    \'key\' => env(\'UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY\'),\n],\n```\n\n## Updates\n\nAdd this command in your deployment script so that wink runs new migrations if any:\n\n```sh\nphp artisan wink:migrate\n```\n\nYou may also want to run this command to re-publish the assets:\n\n```sh\nphp artisan vendor:publish --tag=wink-assets --force\n```\n\n## Themes\n\nWink is shipped with an admin panel that\'s simple to use. However, we give you full control of how you present the stored content in your interface. Here\'s an example of how you\'d get a list of your posts for a blog home screen:\n\n```php\n\nuse Wink\\WinkPost;\n\npublic function index()\n{\n    $posts = WinkPost::with(\'tags\')\n        ->live()\n        ->orderBy(\'publish_date\', \'DESC\')\n        ->simplePaginate(12);\n\n    return view(\'blog.index\', [\n        \'posts\' => $posts\n    ]);\n}\n```\n\nYou can configure your routes in any way you want:\n\n```php\nRoute::get(\'/\', \'BlogController@index\');\n// OR\nRoute::get(\'/blog\', \'BlogController@index\');\n// OR\nRoute::domain(\'blog.mywebsite.com\')->get(\'/\', \'BlogController@index\');\n\n// And for showing a post\nRoute::get(\'/{tag}/{slug}\', \'BlogController@post\');\n// OR\nRoute::get(\'/{year}/{month}/{slug}\', \'BlogController@post\');\n```\n\n## Road map\n\nWink is still under heavy development, I decided to ship it in this early stage so you can help me make it better, however I\'m already using it to run multiple websites including my personal blog.\n\nHere\'s the plan for what\'s coming:\n\n- [x] Customize Twitter/Facebook cards and SEO metadata.\n- [x] Optimize CSS. Move to Tailwind?\n- [x] Add text search inside listings.\n- [x] Filter posts by status, scheduling, tags, and authors\n- [x] Dark mode.\n- [ ] Enhance publishing date picker.\n- [ ] Create an initial theme that people can use right away. @themsaid\n- [ ] Optimize image uploads and allow cropping.\n- [ ] Adding image galleries to posts and pages. @themsaid\n- [ ] Add tests.\n\nAnd here are some ideas I\'m still not sure about:\n\n- [ ] Email Subscription & auto send emails on new content.\n- [ ] Configure roles (Contributor / Admin)\n- [ ] Localization\n- [ ] Multi-lingual content\n- [ ] Attach metadata to posts and pages.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nCheck our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## License\n\nWink is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n'
