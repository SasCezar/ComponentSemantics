You have several options for doing this:\n\n1. The `quantumarticle` class is provided with install scripts for bash and PowerShell. These scripts should work for Windows 7 or later with MiKTeX, or for TeX Live with Linux or macOS / OS X. To install the class into your user-local LaTeX directory you would first clone this git repository `git clone https://github.com/quantum-journal/quantum-journal.git quantum-journal` and them from within bash execute:\n ```bash\n $ cd quantum-journal/\n $ ./install.sh\n ```\n Similarly, under PowerShell:\n ```powershell\n PS > cd quantum-journal/\n PS > ./install.ps1\n ```\n\n2. Alternatively you can use `quantumarticle.cls` without installing it by simply downloading it directly via [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantum-journal/quantum-journal/master/quantumarticle.cls) and putting it in the same folder as your main LaTeX source file. This can be the most convenient option if you are working on a manuscript together with collaborators that do not want to install `quantumarticle.cls` and are exchanging the source files of your manuscript via email or cloud storage services. When you upload your manuscript to the arXiv you will anyway have to include `quantumarticle.cls` along with other source files.\n\n3. To manually install `quantumarticle`, you can either clone this git repository or download `quantumarticle.cls` directly via [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantum-journal/quantum-journal/master/quantumarticle.cls) and then copy the `quantumarticle.cls` file to `texmf/tex/latex/quantumarticle` within your home directory (under Linux, macOS, and OS X `~/`, or under Windows typically `C:\\Users\\[your username]`) and run `texhash` (TeX Live) or `initexmf --update-fndb` (MiKTeX).\n\n4. Finally, you can use `quantumarticle.cls` without even downloading it at all on the collaborative writing platform [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) by starting your project from the `quantumarticle` [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submission-to-quantum-journal/gsjgyhxrtrzy).\n\n## Dependencies\n\n`quantumarticle.cls` should work with any reasonably recent LaTeX distribution. It further requires the following packages: `xkeyval`, `etoolbox`, `geometry`, `xcolor`, `fancyhdr`, `tikz`, `hyperref`, `ltxgrid` and `ltxcmds` (often distributed along with revtex, in texlive for example as part of `texlive-publishers`), as well as at least either `lmodern` or `type1ec`. We recommend to have `natbib` and at least one of `bbm` or `dsfont` installed. All of these should be included in the full install variant of your LaTeX distribution (for example `texlive-full`).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThe `quantumarticle` class tries to be **maximally compatible** with existing document classes, such as, `article`, `revtex`, `iopart`, and `elsarticle`. It supports all standard options, like `twocolumn`, `onecolumn`, `titlepage`, as well as the standard syntax for defining the title page with the `\\author`, `\\address`, and `\\affiliation` commands and the `abstract` environment.\n\n## Beta features\n\nIn addition, this document class come bundled with two new extras (currently in beta phase):\n\n1. The quantum-plots.ipynb Jupyter notebook and matplotlib style for effortlessly producing professional looking plots in python.\n\n2. The quantum-lyx-template.lyx LxY layout, which allow you to generate the LaTeX source of your quantumarticle manuscript with the LyX document processor.\n\n## Changelog\n\n### New in v5.0:\n\n* force users to specify a paper size to prevent unexpected behavior\n* option processing is now done exclusively by means of xkeyval\n* improved compatibility with frequently used LaTeX document classes\n* improved/added options for using this document class for manuscripts not intended for submission to Quantum\n* documents not intended for submission to Quantum can now be compiled with compilers different from PdfLaTeX (e.g. LuaLaTeX)\n* use https in links when possible\n* prevent usage of the `\\today` macro in `\\date` to avoid changing dates in documents when they are re-compiled on the arXiv\n* enforce that users put `\\pdfoutput=1` (as recommended by the arXiv) to prevent problems with multi-line hyper links\n* improved error messages\n* fixed a bug that lead to the title not being centered with the `titlepage` option\n* better layout of titles \n* fixed various bugs in option processing\n* the document class is now documented in `quantumarticle.pdf`\n* introduced the plotting notebook `quantum-plots.ipynb` as a beta feature\n* introduced the LyX template `quantum-lyx-template.lyx` as a beta feature\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nDeveloped by: Christian Gogolin, Christopher Granade, Johannes J.
