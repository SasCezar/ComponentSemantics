It facilitates the automated online publication of scientific software and associated input and output data.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pyrdm/pyrdm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pyrdm/pyrdm)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyrdm/badge/?version=latest)](http://pyrdm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\nIn order to use PyRDM you must build as well as configure the package. Build the package by carrying out the following steps:\n\n1. Make a clone of this repository by `git clone https://github.com/pyrdm/pyrdm.git pyrdm`\n2. Install the core dependencies by `cd pyrdm; sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`\n3. Build the package by `sudo make install`\n4. Build the documentation by `make docs`. This will produce an HTML version of the documentation in the `docs/build` directory. Alternatively, you can view the latest version of the documentation [here](http://pyrdm.readthedocs.io).\n\nThe next step involves configuring PyRDM in order for it to access and upload files to Figshare, Zenodo or DSpace. Please see the [PyRDM documentation](http://pyrdm.readthedocs.io) for a graphical guide on how to do this.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nPyRDM depends on:\n\n* [GitPython](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GitPython/)\n* [requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/)\n* [restkit](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/restkit)\n* [python-client-sword2](https://github.com/swordapp/python-client-sword2)\n* [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) - to build the documentation.\n* [libspud](https://launchpad.net/spud) - this package is not necessary if you do not wish to run the PyRDM-based publication tool `fluidity-publish` specifically designed for the Fluidity CFD code.\n\n\nCiting\n------\n\nWhen citing PyRDM, please use the following citation:\n\n* C.
