b'# Subtitles WordPress Plugin\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/wecobble/Subtitles.svg)](https://gitter.im/wecobble/Subtitles?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge) ![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wecobble/Subtitles.svg?branch=master) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/0a1f6c571a369ebce00b/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/wecobble/Subtitles/maintainability) [![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/0a1f6c571a369ebce00b/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/wecobble/Subtitles/test_coverage)\n\n![Subtitles in action](https://i.cloudup.com/YoFzxUCM2S.png)\n\nAdd subtitles into your WordPress posts, pages, custom post types, and themes. No coding required. Simply activate _Subtitles_ and you\'re ready to go.\n\nRight now WordPress currently presents no easy way for web publishers to add subtitles into their posts, pages, and other custom post types. This leaves users and developers in a bit of a quandary, trying to figure out how best to present subtitles in a beautiful and sensible way. Post [excerpts](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_excerpt) are a very poor choice for subtitles and the only available option outside of [custom fields](http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields), but custom fields aren\'t entirely self-explanatory or user-friendly. This simple, straightforward plugin aims to solve this issue.\n\nSimply download _Subtitles_, activate it, and begin adding subtitles into your posts and pages today. For more advanced usage of the plugin, please see the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/wecobble/Subtitles/blob/master/README.md#frequently-asked-questions).\n\nIf you like _Subtitles_, [thank us with coffee](https://www.paypal.me/wecobble) :coffee:. If you find it buggy, [tell us on GitHub](https://github.com/wecobble/Subtitles/issues) :beetle:. And if you have a cool example of how you\'re using _Subtitles_ on your website, let us know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wecobblellc) :bird:.\n\n## Installation\n\nBy default the _Subtitles_ plugin just works. All you should need to do in order to begin using it is activate the plugin and begin adding subtitles into your posts, pages, and _Subtitles_-enabled custom post types.\n\nThere are no custom template tags to add into your theme and, outside of advanced use, there is nothing you need to do to your theme in order to begin using this plugin.\n\nWhat follows are instructions on how to install the plugin and get it working.\n\n### Using The WordPress Dashboard (Recommended) ###\n\n1. Navigate to *Plugins \xe2\x86\x92 Add New* from within the WordPress Dashboard.\n2. Search for `subtitles`.\n3. Click **Install Now** on *Subtitles* by We Cobble.\n4. Activate the plugin.\n\n### Uploading in WordPress Dashboard ###\n\n1. Navigate to *Plugins \xe2\x86\x92 Add New* from within the WordPress Dashboard.\n2. Click on the **Upload** link underneath the *Install Plugins* page title.\n3. Click the **Browse...** button and choose `subtitles.zip` in its download location on your computer.\n4. Click the **Install Now** button.\n5. Activate the plugin.\n\n### Using FTP (Not Recommended) ###\n\n1. Download `subtitles.zip`.\n2. Extract the `subtitles` directory to your computer.\n3. Upload the `subtitles` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.\n4. Navigate to *Plugins \xe2\x86\x92 Installed Plugins* and activate the plugin.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions ##\n\nThere are two types of questions that are anticipated: user questions and developer questions. I\'ll address the user questions first, and then dive into more detailed information about customizing _Subtitles_.\n\n### How to Use _Subtitles_ ###\n\n_Subtitles_ lets you easily add subtitles into your WordPress posts, pages, custom post types, and themes.\n\n![New post waiting on a title and subtitle](https://i.cloudup.com/HhC9q0j5bH.png)\n\nAfter plugin activation, you should see an input field labeled **Enter subtitle here** immediately under your **Enter title here** input field. After adding a subtitle into your post, simply hit publish and then view your post. There\'s nothing else to do.\n\n---\n\n### Uninstalling _Subtitles_ ###\n\nWhen you uninstall _Subtitles_, nothing will happen to your subtitles post meta. They\'ll still be retained in your database, so if you ever decide to use _Subtitles_ again, you\'ll be able to activate the plugin and have your subtitles show up. In a future release, there may be the option to clean subtitles out of your database, but it didn\'t make the cut for the initial release, and auto-deleting the data on uninstallation would have been a bad move, as subtitles are non-trivial post meta.\n\n---\n\n### _Subtitles_ Doesn\'t Work! ###\n\nThere are two primary issues that may cause users to think that _Subtitles_ doesn\'t work: 1) no subtitles show on the site or 2) weird HTML begins to appear around titles on a site. We will address both of those here.\n\n#### Subtitles Don\'t Show Up On My Site!\n\nSubtitles relies on two things to work properly: 1) `the_title` being present in your theme and 2) the [WordPress Loop](http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop). This plugin works by automatically filtering all appropriate post titles so that you are not put in the position of needing to open your theme files manually and using the [custom template tags](https://github.com/wecobble/Subtitles#using-template-tags) that are available in this plugin.\n\nSome themes use titles outside of the standard WordPress Loop, which means that _Subtitles_ won\'t touch those. If you would like to use subtitles in a non-standard area of your site, outside of the Loop, then you can either change the views that are [supported by the plugin](https://github.com/wecobble/Subtitles#modifying-supported-subtitles-views) or manually use the template tags that are available to you in this plugin.\n\nThe reason this approach has been taken is because if titles outside of the Loop were touched so liberally, you would end up seeing subtitles in places on your site that you wouldn\'t want them, like in sidebars, navigation menus, and admin screens.\n\n#### There\'s Weird HTML Showing Up On My Site!\n\nI can almost guarantee that the reason this is happening is because your theme developer is using either `the_title` or `get_the_title` in places where they should not be used. This is a theme bug, not a plugin bug. When titles are used as attributes, the appropriate template tag to use is `the_title_attribute`, never `the_title`.\n\nPlease see [these long threads](https://github.com/wecobble/Subtitles/issues?q=the_title_attribute) as examples of what happens when themes conflict with _Subtitles_.\n\n---\n\n### SEO ###\n\nWill _Subtitles_ ruin your SEO? That\'s a fair question. The answer is no. We\'ve made a note of exactly why `<spans>` are the default wrappers for subtitles in the [inline developer docs](https://github.com/wecobble/Subtitles/blob/master/subtitles.php) for the plugin, which I\'ll reiterate here:\n\n```php\n * 4. Visually, we have made a major assumption that subtitles belong immediately after titles. The very\n *    definition of a subtitle is that it is a subordinate title of a published work that often gives\n *    explanatory details about the immediately preceeding title. It\'s for this reason that we\'ve chosen\n *    to filter the output of the_title() with the expectation that post titles will be wrapped in\n *    primary heading (h1) tags. So post titles will be H1, while their subtitles will be spans.\n *    Multiple H1 tags in the HTML5 age are okay.\n * 5. The reason that <spans> are being used is because HTML does not have a dedicated mechanism for\n *    marking up subheadings, alternative titles, or taglines. There are suggested alternatives from\n *    the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C); among them are spans, which work well for what we\'re trying\n *    to do with titles in WordPress. See the linked documentation for more information.\n *    @link http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/common-idioms.html#sub-head\n```\n\nIf you\'re worried about SEO and the markup of _Subtitles_, then [roll your own markup](https://github.com/wecobble/Subtitles#modifying-subtitles-markup).\n\n---\n\n### Front-End Performance ###\n\nAs of version 2.0.0, _Subtitles_ outputs its CSS via `wp_head`. This is to load sensible CSS that will ensure your subtitle is always scaled properly alongside your website title and never shown in comment areas.\n\n```css\n/**\n * Plugin Name: Subtitles\n * Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org/plugins/subtitles/\n * Description: Easily add subtitles into your WordPress posts, pages, custom post types, and themes.\n * Author: We Cobble\n * Author URI: https://wecobble.com/\n * Version: 2.1.1\n * License: GNU General Public License v2 or later\n * License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html\n */\n\n/**\n * Be explicit about this styling only applying to spans,\n * since that\'s the default markup that\'s returned by\n * Subtitles. If a developer overrides the default subtitles\n * markup with another element or class, we don\'t want to stomp\n * on that.\n *\n * @since 1.0.0\n */\nspan.entry-subtitle {\n\tdisplay: block; /* Put subtitles on their own line by default. */\n\tfont-size: 0.53333333333333em; /* Sensible scaling. It\'s assumed that post titles will be wrapped in heading tags. */\n}\n/**\n * If subtitles are shown in comment areas, we\'ll hide them by default.\n *\n * @since 1.0.5\n */\n#comments .comments-title span.entry-subtitle {\n\tdisplay: none;\n}\n```\n\nIf you\'d like to remove this additional CSS, then simply add a similar function to the following in your plugin or theme\'s primary setup file:\n\n```php\nif ( class_exists( \'Subtitles\' ) && method_exists( \'Subtitles\', \'subtitle_styling\' ) ) {\n\tremove_action( \'wp_head\', array( Subtitles::getInstance(), \'subtitle_styling\' ) );\n}\n```\n\nAfter doing this, no styling should be loaded on the front end of your site and you\'ll need to style subtitles using your own CSS.\n\n---\n\n### Adding _Subtitles_ Support into Custom Post Types ###\n\nIf you\'d like to add _Subtitles_ support into a custom post type, use `add_post_type_support` in a function hooked to `init`, for example:\n\n```php\nfunction theme_slug_add_subtitles_support() {\n\tadd_post_type_support( \'custom-post-type-slug\', \'subtitles\' );\n}\nadd_action( \'init\', \'theme_slug_add_subtitles_support\' );\n```\n\nThis should also work on core-supported post types, like `attachment`.\n\n---\n\n### Removing Default Support from Posts and Pages ###\n\nIf you\'d like to remove _Subtitles_ support from posts or pages, use `remove_post_type_support` in a function hooked to `init`, for example:\n\n```php\nfunction remove_subtitles_support() {\n\tremove_post_type_support( \'post\', \'subtitles\' );\n\tremove_post_type_support( \'page\', \'subtitles\' );\n}\nadd_action( \'init\', \'remove_subtitles_support\' );\n```\n\nThis will work on any post type that may have had _Subtitles_ support added into it elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Modifying _Subtitles_ Markup ###\n\nHTML does not have a dedicated mechanism for marking up subheadings, alternative titles, or taglines. There are [suggested alternatives](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/common-idioms.html#sub-head) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C); among them are spans, which work well for what we\'re trying to do with titles in WordPress.\n\nIf for some reason you\'d like to change the markup, hook a custom output function to `subtitle_markup`, for example:\n\n```php\nfunction subtitle_markup_mods( $markup ) {\n\t$markup[ \'before\' ] = \'<span class="custom-subtitle-class">\';\n\t$markup[ \'after\' ] = \'</span>\';\n\n\treturn $markup;\n}\nadd_filter( \'subtitle_markup\', \'subtitle_markup_mods\' );\n```\n\nI do not suggest using headings tags for subtitles.\n\n---\n\n### Displaying _Subtitles_ in RSS Feeds ###\n\nBy default subtitles do not show in RSS feeds. If you\'d like to show them then the following snippet should help:\n\n```php\n/**\n * Show subtitles in RSS feeds.\n */\nfunction display_subtitles_in_rss_feeds() {\n\treturn false;\n} // end function display_subtitles_in_rss_feeds\nadd_filter( \'subtitles_is_feed\', \'display_subtitles_in_rss_feeds\' );\n```\n\n---\n\n### Modifying Supported _Subtitles_ Views ###\n\nBy default, subtitles appear on most views throughout a site. This includes single post views, single page views, archive views, and search results pages.\n\nIf you\'d like to change this behavior, you can do so by taking advantage of `subtitle_view_supported`. For example, if you\'d like to hide subtitles on all archive pages, the following code would work:\n\n```php\n/**\n * Disable Subtitles in archive views.\n *\n * @see function is_archive\n * @see function in_the_loop\n */\nfunction subtitles_mod_supported_views() {\n\t// Ditch subtitles in archives.\n\tif ( is_archive() ) {\n\t\treturn false;\n\t}\n\n\t// Default in The Loop behavior from Subtitles.\n\tif ( in_the_loop() ) {\n\t\treturn true;\n\t}\n} // end function subtitles_mod_supported_views\nadd_filter( \'subtitle_view_supported\', \'subtitles_mod_supported_views\' );\n```\n\n---\n\n### Allow Developers to Override the Early Bailout if No Subtitle Exists. ###\n\nBy default, the plugin will bail out early if no subtitle is present on a post. As of version 2.2.0, this behavior can be modified. The sample code snippet below will work just fine:\n\n```php\n/**\n * Override the early return if no subtitle exists.\n *\n * @see function is_archive\n * @see function in_the_loop\n */\nfunction subtitle_does_exist() {\n\treturn true;\n\n} // end function subtitle_does_exist\nadd_filter( \'subtitle_exists\', \'subtitle_does_exist\' );\n```\n\n---\n\n### Filtering All Subtitle Output ###\n\nIf you\'d like to change the output of all subtitles throughout your site, use a function hooked to `the_subtitle`, for example:\n\n```php\nfunction better_subtitle( $title ) {\n\treturn $title . \'Hello World\';\n}\nadd_filter( \'the_subtitle\', \'better_subtitle\' );\n```\n\nThis will filter both the title and subtitle output after _Subtitles_ has done all of its magic.\n\n---\n\n### Using Template Tags ###\n\nI very much hope that you do not need to use these template tags, because all of the above methods for handling subtitles should be enough. That said, in the event that you do need to use either `the_subtitle()` or `get_the_subtitle()`, they exist in the plugin and will give you a little bit more flexibility over your theme.\n\nThey work in the same way that `the_title()` and `get_the_title()` work, for example:\n\n```php\nif ( function_exists( \'the_subtitle\' ) ) {\n\tthe_subtitle( \'<p class="entry-subtitle">\', \'</p>\' );\n}\n```\n\nHere\'s how using `get_the_subtitle` would look:\n\n```php\nif ( function_exists( \'get_the_subtitle\' ) ) {\n\techo get_the_subtitle( 35 );\n}\n```\n\nAn ID isn\'t necessary for `get_the_subtitle`, but will work for retrieving subtitles from posts that aren\'t currently being viewed.\n\n---\n\n### Modifying Allowed Tags ###\n\nBy default _Subtitles_ supports both bold and italicized text. If you want more control over this, you can take advantage of the `subtitles_allowed_tags` filter.\n\n```php\nfunction subtitles_mod_allowed_tags( $args ) {\n\t$args = array(\n\t\t\'i\' => array(), // italicized text\n\t\t\'em\' => array(), // emphasized text\n\t\t\'strong\' => array(), // strong text\n\t\t\'a\' => array(\n\t\t\t\'href\' => true, // links\n\t\t),\n\t);\n\n\treturn $args;\n} // end function subtitles_mod_allowed_tags\nadd_filter( \'subtitles_allowed_tags\', \'subtitles_mod_allowed_tags\' );\n```\nProceed with caution here. In some cases getting too cavalier with this may introduce HTML issues into your site.\n\n---\n\n## Changelog\n\nAll versions of _Subtitles_ can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/wecobble/Subtitles/releases) page.\n\n### [v4.0.0] (TBD)\n\n- TBD\n\n### [v3.0.0](https://github.com/wecobble/Subtitles/releases/tag/v3.0.0) (August 8th, 2017)\n\n- **Version Bump:** Fix all WordPress Coding Standards errors and update Tested Up To version.\n- **Patch:** Transfer ownership of plugin to [We Cobble](https://wecobble.com/)\n- **Patch:** Change plugin donation link to point to We Cobble PayPal account.\n\n### [v2.2.1](https://github.com/wecobble/Subtitles/releases/tag/v2.2.1) (June 13th, 2016)\n\n- **Version Bump:** Fix wonky 2.2.0 release.
