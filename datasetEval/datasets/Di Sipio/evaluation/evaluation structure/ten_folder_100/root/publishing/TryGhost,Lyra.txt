You\'ll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed globally. After that, from the theme\'s root directory:\n\n```bash\n# Install\nyarn\n\n# Run build & watch for changes\n$ yarn dev\n```\n\nNow you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.\n\nThe `zip` Gulp task packages the theme files into `dist/<theme-name>.zip`, which you can then upload to your site.\n\n```bash\nyarn zip\n```\n\n# PostCSS Features Used\n\n- Autoprefixer - Don\'t worry about writing browser prefixes of any kind, it\'s all done automatically with support for the latest 2 major versions of every browser.\n- Variables - Simple pure CSS variables\n- [Color Function](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-color-function)\n\n\n# Copyright & License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2019 Ghost Foundation - Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).\n'
