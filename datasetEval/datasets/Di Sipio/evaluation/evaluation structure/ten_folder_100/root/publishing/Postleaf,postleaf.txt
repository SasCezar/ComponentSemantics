Chase your dreams, lil\xe2\x80\x99 ones. \xf0\x9f\x92\x99\xf0\x9f\x92\x9a\n\n## Documentation\n\nDetailed instructions for installing, updating, and creating themes can be found at [postleaf.org/docs](https://www.postleaf.org/docs).\n\n## Installation for Developers\n\nThis guide assumes you\'re installing Postleaf locally for development purposes. Please make sure the following dependencies are installed on your system before continuing:\n\n- Node 7 (lower versions have not been tested and are not supported)\n- npm\n- Git\n- SQLite 3\n- GraphicsMagick\n\n**You will also need access to an SMTP server for sending emails.** Otherwise, you won\'t be able to create users, perform password resets, etc. If you don\'t already have a transactional email service, the folks over at Discourse have put together a great [list of email providers](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-email.md) \xe2\x80\x94 many of which offer free plans.\n\nTo install Postleaf in a development environment, follow these instructions.\n\n1. Open a terminal and clone the project and default theme:\n  ```\n  git clone https://github.com/Postleaf/postleaf.git\n  git clone https://github.com/Postleaf/empower-theme.git themes/empower-theme\n  ```\n2. Make a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env`. Open it and change `AUTH_SECRET` to a random string to secure your app. Then add your SMTP credentials so email can be sent. You also need to set the `APP_URL` to `http://localhost:3000/`.\n3. Install dependencies and run the build script:\n  ```\n  npm install\n  sudo npm install -g gulp-cli\n  gulp build\n  ```\n4. Now launch the app:\n  ```\n  node app.js\n  ```\n\nAt this point, you should be able to see Postleaf running by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`.\n\n## Themes\n\nTo install a theme, simply add it to the `themes` directory. There are a few additional themes located in the [main repo](https://github.com/Postleaf).\n\nTo learn how to create your own theme, refer to the [theme documentation](https://www.postleaf.org/themes-overview).\n\n## Support\n\nPlease **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests.
