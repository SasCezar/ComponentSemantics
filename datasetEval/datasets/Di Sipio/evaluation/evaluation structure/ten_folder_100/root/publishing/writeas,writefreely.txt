It\'s easy to install and light enough to run on a Raspberry Pi.\n\n[Try the editor](https://write.as/new)\n\n[Find an instance](https://writefreely.org/instances)\n\n## Features\n\n* Start a blog for yourself, or host a community of writers\n* Form larger federated networks, and interact over modern protocols like ActivityPub\n* Write on a fast, dead-simple, and distraction-free editor\n* [Format text](https://howto.write.as/getting-started) with Markdown\n* [Organize posts](https://howto.write.as/organization) with hashtags\n* Create [static pages](https://howto.write.as/creating-a-static-page)\n* Publish drafts and let others proofread them by sharing a private link\n* Create multiple lightweight blogs under a single account\n* Export all data in plain text files\n* Read a stream of other posts in your writing community\n* Build more advanced apps and extensions with the [well-documented API](https://developers.write.as/docs/api/)\n* Designed around user privacy and consent\n\n## Hosting\n\nWe offer two kinds of hosting services that make WriteFreely deployment painless: [Write.as Pro](https://write.as/pro) for individuals, and [Write.as for Teams](https://write.as/for/teams) for businesses.
