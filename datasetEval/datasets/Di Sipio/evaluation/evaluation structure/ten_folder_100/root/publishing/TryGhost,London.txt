b"# London\n\nA custom, image-centric theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). Made for publishers and portfolios with plenty of graphics to show off to the world. Completely free and fully responsive, released under the MIT license.\n\n**Demo: https://london.ghost.io**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![london](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120485/50552024-84837400-0c82-11e9-8f1d-cf25962c7e62.jpg)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# First time using a Ghost theme?\n\nGhost uses a simple templating language called [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for its themes.\n\nWe've documented our default theme pretty heavily so that it should be fairly easy to work out what's going on just by reading the code and the comments. Once you feel comfortable with how everything works, we also have full [theme API documentation](https://themes.ghost.org) which explains every possible Handlebars helper and template.\n\n**The main files are:**\n\n- `default.hbs` - The main template file\n- `index.hbs` - Used for the home page\n- `post.hbs` - Used for individual posts\n- `page.hbs` - Used for individual pages\n- `tag.hbs` - Used for tag archives\n- `author.hbs` - Used for author archives\n\nOne neat trick is that you can also create custom one-off templates just by adding the slug of a page to a template file. For example:\n\n- `page-about.hbs` - Custom template for the `/about/` page\n- `tag-news.hbs` - Custom template for `/tag/news/` archive\n- `author-ali.hbs` - Custom template for `/author/ali/` archive\n\n\n# Development\n\nLondon styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn install\n$ yarn dev\n```\n\nNow you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.\n\nThe `zip` Gulp task packages the theme files into `dist/<theme-name>.zip`, which you can then upload to your site.\n\n```bash\n$ yarn zip\n```\n\n# PostCSS Features Used\n\n- Autoprefixer - Don't worry about writing browser prefixes of any kind, it's all done automatically with support for the latest 2 major versions of every browser.\n- Variables - Simple pure CSS variables\n- [Color Function](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-color-function)\n\n\n# Copyright & License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2019 Ghost Foundation - Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).\n"
