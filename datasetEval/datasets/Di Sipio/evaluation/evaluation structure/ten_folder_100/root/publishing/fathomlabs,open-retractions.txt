If the field is false, it means a non-retraction update to the paper was recorded by the publisher. This could be:\n\n- a correction or erratum\n- an expression of concern\n- a withdrawal\n\nIn some cases, publishers mis-label retractions as other updates. It is therefore best to follow the update link to check the full statement about any update.\n\nHere\'s an example JSON response that shows the full format:\n\n```js\n{\n  "retracted": false,  // whether or not the paper has been retracted\n  "timestamp": 1361836800000, // the UNIXtime when the original paper was published\n  "update": {\n    "timestamp": 1491464002919, // the UNIXtime when the update was recorded\n    "doi": "10.1002/job.1858", // the DOI of the update\n    "type": "correction" // the publisher\'s description of the update\n  },\n  "doi": "10.1002/job.1787", // the DOI of the original paper\n  "journal": "Journal of Organizational Behavior",\n  "publisher": "Wiley-Blackwell",\n  "title": "Erratum: Cognitive and affective identification: Exploring the links between different forms of social identification and personality with work attitudes and behavior"\n}\n```\n\n## credits\n\n- The web app is built with [choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo) :steam_locomotive::train::train::train::train: by [@yoshuawuyts](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts) - we really :heart: choo.\n- The data currently comes from:\n  - the [PubMed API](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/develop/api.shtml), using [bionode-ncbi](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-ncbi)\n  - the [CrossRef API](http://api.crossref.org), using [crossref-retractions](https://github.com/fathomlabs/crossref-retractions)\n- We use [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) by [@stedolan](https://github.com/stedolan) a lot for manipulating streams of JSON data.\n\n## copyright and licenses\n\n**The code** in this repository is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/fathomlabs/crossref-cli/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n**The data** are factual and therefore not subject to copyright.
