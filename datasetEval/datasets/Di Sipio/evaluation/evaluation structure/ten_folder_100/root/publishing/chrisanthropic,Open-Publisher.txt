b"## What is Open-Publisher\nOpen publisher is really just a couple of bash scripts that wrap around Jekyll, Pandoc, KindleGen, and LaTeX, along with some custom Pandoc templates created with a focus on fiction.\n\nWrite your manuscript in markdown, run a script, and receive some beautifully formatted ePub, Mobi, and print-ready PDF books.\n\nFull documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/chrisanthropic/Open-Publisher/wiki)\n\n## Why is Open-Publisher\nMy wife is [an author](https://www.backthatelfup.com) and I handle all of the digital/print book creation. After 4+ years of using various tools I decided to streamline my process.\n\nIt can be a pain to manually update a Bio page with new information or new books for example. Doing a simple thing like that for 3 formats of a dozen books can take time and introduces the possibility of new typos with every change.\n\nPandoc is a great tool to convert markdown files to html/epub/pdf etc. but it's epub templating is still very minimalistic. It requires multiple stages to create a template that allows me to reuse common pages such as biography, licensing, etc.\n\nI love Jekyll and use it whenever I can for web design. One of my favorite aspects is the ability to define 'code chunks' in the _includes folder and then use reference it wherever I want. Change that include file, rebuild, and every reference to it on your website is updated. It's that kind of logic that I need for creating my books.\n\nBy using Jekyll's templating I'm able to create files that slightly differ based on need. The mandatory Smashwords title page for example, or a custom Title page with Amazon URLs to other books.\n\nJekyll allows me to create custom templates, multiple 'includes', and then outputs them in a perfectly formatted Markdown file.\n\nThis markdown file can then be passed along to Pandoc and converted to epub/mobi/pdf.\n"
