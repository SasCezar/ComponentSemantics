b"# AsciiDoc Book Toolchain\n\nThis repository contains a basic toolchain used to publish book using\n[AsciiDoc]. It compiles the book down to:\n\n  - HTML\n  - PDF\n  - PDF (printable)\n  - ePub\n  - MOBI\n\nThis toolchain has been created and is used in the first place to publish\n[The Hacker's Guide to Python].\n\n# Required software\n- [AsciiDoc]\n- Xetex\n- [Calibre]\n- [Ghostscript]\n- [Docbook]\n\nIf you run on a Fedora system, just run the `deps` target of the makefile as root to install them like in :\n\n - sudo make deps\n\n## Usage\n\nThe book content should be written in the `book.txt` source file. Once you've\nmade some change you can recompile all the output formats by typing `make`, or\nselecting each one you want by typing `make book.<format>`: such as:\n\n  - `make book.pdf`\n  - `make book.epub`\n  - `make book.mobi`\n  - `make book.html`\n  - `make book.printable.pdf`\n\n## Difference between the normal and printable PDF\n\nThe `Makefile` generates two different PDF format. The first one named\n`book.pdf` is for the electronic version of the book, and embed the cover\nimage. The second one, named `book.printable.pdf` is intended to be printed on\npaper, so it does not include the cover and have slightly different dimensions.\n\n\n   [AsciiDoc]: <http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/>\n   [The Hacker's Guide to Python]: <https://thehackerguidetopython.com>\n   [Calibre]: https://calibre-ebook.com/\n   [Ghostscript]: http://www.ghostscript.com/\n   [Docbook]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docbook\n"
