Which is optional on React, but provides a way to write modern code and compile to be compatible with legacy browsers. We use [babeljs.io](babeljs.io) with the presets: react and es2015 to compile to JS files.\n\n#### Compiling JSX files to JS\n\nYou can install Babel on your environment following its documentation. But here we will describe how to use a Docker container for that.\n\n```\n$ docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/app ostraining/node-babel:latest bash\n```\n\n**To compile one file**\n\n```\n# babel src/modules/efmigration/lib/js/efmigration.jsx --out-file src/modules/efmigration/lib/js/efmigration.js\n```\n\n**To watch a folder automatically compile changed files**\n\n```\n# babel -w src/modules/efmigration/lib/babel -d src/modules/efmigration/lib/js\n```\n\n## License\n\nLicense: [GPLv2 or later](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)\n'
