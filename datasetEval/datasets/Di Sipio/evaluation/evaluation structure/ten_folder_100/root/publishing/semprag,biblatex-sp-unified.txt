b'biblatex-sp-unified\n===================\n\n`biblatex-sp-unified` is an opinionated BibLaTeX implementation of the [Unified Stylesheet for Linguistics Journal](http://celxj.org/downloads/UnifiedStyleSheet.pdf).\nThe stylesheet was developed by [CELxJ, the Committee of Editors of Linguistics Journals](http://celxj.org/).\nThere is a standard BibTeX implementation, called [`unified.bst`](http://celxj.org/downloads/unified.bst), which was developed by Bridget Samuels, based on work done for the house-style of the journal [*Semantics and Pragmatics*](http://semprag.org) (*S&P*).\n\nThis project is a ground-up re-implementation in modern BibLaTeX. It is now being used by *S&P* in production.\n\nFull documentation of the design choices can be found in [doc/DOCUMENTATION.md](doc/DOCUMENTATION.md).\n\nPlease [file an issue](https://github.com/semprag/biblatex-sp-unified/issues/new) to let us know of any problems you encounter and any recommendations for improvement.\n\n\n## Sources\n\nThe `biblatex-sp-unified` style consists of two files:\n\n* [`biblatex-sp-unified.bbx`](bbx/biblatex-sp-unified.bbx) -- for formatting the bibliography.\n* [`sp-authoryear-comp.cbx`](cbx/sp-authoryear-comp.cbx) -- for formatting in-text citations in the style of *S&P*.\n  - Since the Unified Stylesheet does not give any guidelines for in-text citations, this file is optional and users can choose other citation styles.\n\n\n## Requirements and backward compatibility\n\nCompiling LaTeX documents with this style depends on a modern TeX installation that includes BibLaTeX 2.0+.\nIt is tested only with the `biber` backend.\n\nThis repository\'s tags correspond to supported BibLaTeX versions.\nIf you have BibLaTeX `3.8` (or `3.8a`), you should use `biblatex-sp-unified@3.8.x` where `x` is the latest value in the series.\n\nYou can check which version of BibLaTeX you have by running `tlmgr info biblatex --only-installed --data cat-version` at the command line.\n\n\n### Installation\n\nThe commands in this section must be run at the command line,\ne.g., `Terminal.app` on MacOS, or `Terminal` on many common Linux GUIs.\n\nThe two source files should be put somewhere where your TeX system can find them; for example, under the `TEXMF` "home" directory. Run this command to create the directory structure:\n\n    mkdir -p $(kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME)/tex/latex/biblatex\n\nAnd then copy/download each file into that directory (replace `master` in the URLs with the appropriate tag if you have an older version of BibLaTeX):\n\n    cd $(kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME)/tex/latex/biblatex\n    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semprag/biblatex-sp-unified/master/bbx/biblatex-sp-unified.bbx\n    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semprag/biblatex-sp-unified/master/cbx/sp-authoryear-comp.cbx\n\nIf you are using the MacTeX distribution on macOS, you will end up with a file structure that looks like this:\n\n    ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/biblatex/biblatex-sp-unified.bbx\n    ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/biblatex/sp-authoryear-comp.cbx\n\n\n### Configuring your `.tex` document to use the style\n\nTo use the style in conjunction with *S&P*\'s [`sp.cls`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semprag/tex/master/sp.cls),\nsimply add the `biblatex` class option when importing `sp.cls`:\n\n    \\documentclass[biblatex]{sp}\n\nIf you are not using the `S&P` document class, you can still use this style by adding the following to your preamble (after `\\documentclass{...}` but before `\\begin{document}`):\n\n    \\usepackage[backend=biber,\n                bibstyle=biblatex-sp-unified,\n                citestyle=sp-authoryear-comp,\n                maxcitenames=3,\n                maxbibnames=99]{biblatex}\n\n<!-- same as https://github.com/semprag/tex/blob/585f282/sp.cls#L126-L130 -->\n\nIf you were previously using `natbib`, remove `\\usepackage{natbib}` and any accompanying `\\bibliographystyle{...}` and `\\bibpunct{...}` settings.\nYou might also find it helpful to add `natbib` to the list of options (`\\usepackage[..., natbib]{biblatex}`), to load BibLaTeX\'s `natbib` compatibility module, which implements common `natbib` commands like `\\citet`, `\\citep`, `\\citealt`, `\\citealp`, etc.\n\n\n### Configuring your document to use BibLaTeX instead of BibTeX\n\nWhether you\'re using `sp.cls` or a different document class, you\'ll need to change the usual BibTeX commands to BibLaTeX, in two places:\n\n1. Replace the `\\bibliography{your-bibfile}` line in the backmatter with `\\printbibliography`.\n2. Add the following command to your preamble: `\\addbibresource{your-bibfile.bib}`\n   - NB: the `.bib` extension must be included (unlike BibTeX)\n\n\n## Testing\n\nTesting consists of rendering `unified-test.tex` (and `unified-test.bib`) into a PDF, converting to plain text, then comparing to a static file containing the expected output (`test/unified-test.expected.md`)[test/unified-test.expected.md].\nThe various steps are specified in the [`Makefile`](Makefile), which can be run by calling `make test`.\n'
