b'# hello-vue + Django\n\nThis is a boilerplate project for using vuejs with Django.\n\n### Features\n\n* Django backend in `./backend`\n* vuejs (v2) frontend in `./frontend`\n* Hot-reload with vue-loader\n* eslint linter integration\n* Makefile to make your life easy\n\n\n### Development environment setup\n\nThese steps will install all required dependencies including development ones, run migrations and start dev server.\n\n```bash\nmake dev\nmake migrate\nmake run\n```\n\n### Deployment\n\nThese steps will install production dependencies and build vuejs application to `static/dist` folder.\n\n```bash\nmake prod\nmake build\n```\n\n### Be aware\n\nFor the sake of simplicity Django config is contained within its own backend app. In real world setting you would\nprobably want to remove `backend` from `INSTALLED_APPS`, create a new app and move `backend.views` to it.\n\nYou probably want to create python virtual environment as well. Default python instance available will be used.\n'
