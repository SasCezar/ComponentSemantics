b'# Chunky\r\n\r\nChunky is a Minecraft mapping and rendering tool.\r\n\r\nQuick links:\r\n\r\n* [![Join our Discord server!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llbit/chunky/master/misc/discord.png)](https://discord.gg/VqcHpsF)\r\n* [Documentation][1]\r\n* [Troubleshooting][2]\r\n* [Subreddit][3]\r\n* [Development Blog][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright & License\r\n\r\nChunky is Copyright (c) 2010-2017, Jesper \xc3\x96qvist <jesper@llbit.se>\r\n\r\nPermission to modify and redistribute is granted under the terms of\r\nthe GPLv3 license.

If Chunky has too little memory to work with it\r\nmay slow down to a crawl or crash. The memory limit can be increased in the\r\nChunky Launcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Rendering using the command line (Headless Mode)\r\n\r\nIt is possible to render a scene from the command line. First set up a scene\r\nusing the GUI. Don\'t forget to save the scene. Then run the following on the\r\ncommand line:\r\n\r\n    java -jar chunky.jar -render SceneName\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere SceneName is the name of the scene to render. You can read more about\r\n[headless rendering here.][5]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Shutdown when render completes on Unix-like Systems (Mac OS X, Linux, BSD)\r\n\r\nIn the Advanced tab of the Render Controls window, you can check the checkbox\r\nthat says "Shutdown when render completes" to shut down your computer when the\r\nset SPP target is reached.  (This can be toggled while rendering.)\r\n\r\nOn Unix-like systems, the `shutdown` terminal command has to be run as root\r\nusing `sudo`.  For various reasons, Chunky cannot prompt for the password to\r\n`sudo`, so you must configure your system to allow the command to run without a\r\npassword.\r\n\r\nOpen a terminal (such as bash) and run `sudo visudo`, providing your password.\r\n\r\nAdd the following line at the end of the file: (press Insert to type)\r\n\r\n    %user_name ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown\r\n\r\n\r\nReplace `user_name` with your username.\r\n\r\nPress Escape, then type `:wq`.\r\n\r\nYou may need to restart or log out and in for this to take effect.\r\n\r\nThis will only allow `sudo shutdown` to run without a password; no other\r\ncommands run with `sudo` will be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Hacking on Chunky\r\n\r\nTo build Chunky, run the `gradlew` script in the project root directory:\r\n\r\n   ./gradlew jar\r\n\r\nThis just builds the core libraries. To build an installable file takes\r\na bit more work; [refer to this repository][7].\r\n\r\nChunky is split into four subprojects:\r\n\r\n* **chunky** - the core rendering and GUI project\r\n* **lib** - common code required by the other projects\r\n* **launcher** - the launcher\r\n* **releasetools** - tool used for packaging releases\r\n\r\nIf you want to hack on Chunky itself you will need to load the `chunky` and\r\n`lib` directories in your favorite editor. If available, use a Gradle project\r\nimport option.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Style\r\n\r\nThe [Google Java style guide][6] should be followed for new code (2 spaces for\r\nindentation, no tabs). If you want to contribute code to Chunky please make\r\nyour code look similar to the rest of the code, and refer to the style guide\r\nwhen in doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\n\r\nMore information about Chunky, including a short getting started guide and\r\nrendering tips are available at the [Chunky Documentation page.][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: http://chunky.llbit.se\r\n[2]: http://chunky.llbit.se/troubleshooting.html\r\n[3]: http://www.reddit.com/r/chunky\r\n[4]: http://llbit.se\r\n[5]: http://chunky.llbit.se/headless.html\r\n[6]: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html\r\n[7]: https://github.com/llbit/chunky-releasetools\r\n'
