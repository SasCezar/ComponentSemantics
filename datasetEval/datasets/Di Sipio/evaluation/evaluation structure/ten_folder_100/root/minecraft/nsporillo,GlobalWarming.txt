This is a very new project and I appreciate contributions.\n\n## Builds\n- <strike><a href="http://jenkins.porillo.net/job/GlobalWarming/">Snapshots on <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3FtNxcM.png" height="30"></a></strike> \n- Jenkins was exploited with RCE, currently down for maintenence.\n\n## Overview\n+ Adds the concept of greenhouse gases (CO2) in the worlds atmosphere \n+ Furnaces emit CO2 when players smelt items\n+ Farmed Animals emit CH4 when they are killed\n+ Trees (instantly) absorb CO2 when they grow from a sapling\n+ As CO2 levels rise, global temperature rises because of the [Greenhouse Effect](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/grnhse.html)\n\n## Purpose\n+ Ever had the hankering to turn a game meant for fun into an emulator of one of the modern world\'s toughest challenges?\n+ Observe the [Prisoner\'s Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#In_environmental_studies) first hand! \n+ Players are best off when they co-operate and agree to reduce their emissions\n+ However, each player typically believes they are better off for themselves to emit as much as they wish. \n+ Avoiding a [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) might be fun! If the players don\'t play nice and end up dealing with the consequences, they might decide to agree to fix the planet. \n\n## Mechanics \n+ Every furnace burn causes a "Contribution" to emissions with an associated numerical value (based on the model)\n+ Every tree growth causes a "Reduction" from emissions with an associated numerical value (based on the model)\n+ The global temperature is a function of the net global carbon score. \n+ As the global temperature rises, the frequency and severity of negative climate damages increases.\n+ Players can purchase "carbon offsets" which creates a tree-planting bounty for other players to fulfill. \n\n## Challenges\n+ Designing a default model that doesn\'t quickly destroy worlds\n+ Efficiently applying in-game mechanics changes\n\n## (Planned) Features\n+ Scoreboard Integration - Players can compete for carbon neutrality! The worst polluters can be shamed.\n+ Economy Integration - Carbon Offsetting using your in-game currency! Set up tree-planting bounties \n+ Carbon Scorecard - Each player can see their latest carbon footprint trends via the command line.\n+ Multi-world - You can experiment with this plugin on one of your worlds to test it out!\n+ Custom Models - The inner numerical workings are as configurable as possible. Set thresholds, probabilities, and distributions.\n+ Database storage - Load data on startup, queue DB changes to be done async and at intervals (instead of as they happen, that\'d kill performance), and empty queue on shutdown. \n+ Highly configurable - Almost everything will have some degree of configuration to suit your server\'s needs.\n+ Efficient - Despite major mechanics changes and an extensive event listening setup, I plan to optimize this plugin to be suitable for up to medium to large servers. \n\n\n## Negative Climate Damages (Sample Model)\nHigher temps inherit the damages from the lower temps\n\n| Global Temp | Effect 1 | Effect 2 | Effect 3 | Effect 4 |\n| ------ | ------------ | ------- | --------|-----------|\n| 14.0 C | None | | | |\n| 15.0 C | Some mobs spawn less | some mobs spawn more | | |\n| 16.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Some fish die | Ice/Snow stops forming | |\n| 17.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Flora species growth stunted | Aquatic life stops spawning | Ocean flora/fauna die |\n| 18.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Area Potion Effect Clouds | Farm yields lower | Snow/Ice melts |\n| 19.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Forest Fires | Slower Health Regen | Frequent T-Storms | |\n| 20.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Severe Forest Fires | Violent T-Storms | Permanent Slowness Effect |\n\nThese are just a sample of the possible effects, these will be configurable and implement randomness and probabilities.\n\n\n## Roadmap\n+ Support for non-spigot platforms.\n+ <strike>Incorporate Methane, since CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas that matters.</strike> Done!\n\n## Related Science of Climate Change\n### Atmosphere warms with more CO2 because of Greenhouse Effect\n![Greenhouse Effect](https://i.imgur.com/XsWJGz9.png)\n### Atmospheric Energy Budget\n+ ![Earth\'s Global Energy Budget](https://i.imgur.com/aHdJxXc.png)\n\nSource: RIT "Climate Change: Science, Technology, and Policy" lecture slides\n### Impact on Oceans\n![Oceans](https://i.imgur.com/dJPkYAo.png)\n\nSource: RIT "Climate Change: Science, Technology, and Policy" lecture slides\n### Ecological Niche\n![Niche](https://i.imgur.com/e6pwXlI.png)\n- Species have a temperature range in which they can survive\n- Plants also have niches (Sunlight, Temperature, Water, Nutrients, CO2, Soil, etc)\n\nSource: RIT "Climate Change: Science, Technology, and Policy" lecture slides\n\n## Suggestions \nFeel free to create issues on this GitHub project, or join the discord\n'
