It is not:\n  - Something to make Minecraft run faster\n  - For older computers\n  - A rewrite of the tick system\n  - A rewrite of the audio system\n  - Anything to do with the MC server\n\n## Development Status\n\nNova Renderer is a passion project by the developers and as such does not have any set deadlines or release dates.\nWe are still in early development of the multi-backend rewrite and things may change at any moment. That all being said, it is still in quite active development.\n\n## Developer Setup\n\n[Contributing](docs/contributing.md).\n\nNova is built the same way most cmake projects are built. However, git submodules need to be cloned:\n\n```\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\nFrom there, standard cmake build:\n\n### Windows\n\n```\n# Generate Visual Studio Project\ncmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -Wno-dev\n# Build from command line, or open into Visual Studio\ncmake --build build\n```\n\n### Unix\n\nIf you have the ninja build tool, it is the recommended way of building.\n\n```\n# Generate build.ninja\ncmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -GNinja -Wno-dev\n# Build from command line, or open into Visual Studio\nninja -C build\n```\n\nIf you don\'t have ninja, use regular make.\n\n```\n# Generate makefile\ncmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -Wno-dev\n# Build from command line\nmake -C build -j$(nproc)\n```\n\nPlease read the following to help get a feel for the project:\n\n- [The Project Charter](docs/project_charter.md).\n- [Git Rules](docs/git.md). **These must be followed for your PR to be accepted.**\n\nPlease contact us on Discord if you want to help!
