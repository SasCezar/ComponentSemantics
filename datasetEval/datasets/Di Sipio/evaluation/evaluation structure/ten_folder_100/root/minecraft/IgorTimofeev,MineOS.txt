Here's a short features list:\n\n-   Multitasking\n-   Double buffered graphical user interface\n-   Language packs and software localization\n-   Multiple user profiles with password authentication\n-   Own EEPROM firmware with boot volume choose/format/rename features and Internet Recovery mode\n-   File sharing over the local network via modems\n-   Client connections to real FTP servers\n-   An internal IDE with syntax highlighting and debugger\n-   App Market for publishing programs for every MineOS user\n-   Error reporting system with the possibility to send information to developers\n-   Animations, wallpapers, screensavers, color schemes and huge customization possibilities\n-   Open source system API and detailed illustrated documentations\n\n## How to install?\n\nThe easiest way is to use default **pastebin** script. Insert OpenOS floppy disk to computer, insert an Internet Card, turn computer on and type the following to console:\n\n\tpastebin run 0nm5b1ju\n\nAfter a moment, a nice system installer will be shown. You will be prompted to select your preferred language, select and format a boot volume, create a user profile and customize some settings. After that, the system will be successfully installed.\n\n## How to \\*do_something\\*?\n\n[Wiki-wiki-wiki. Wi...\n...\n...ki.](https://github.com/IgorTimofeev/MineOS/wiki)\n"
