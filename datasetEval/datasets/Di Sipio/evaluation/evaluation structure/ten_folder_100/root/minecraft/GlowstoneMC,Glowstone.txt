Glowstone makes use of a thread-per-world model and performs\nsynchronization only when necessitated by the Bukkit API.\n\nStill have questions? Check out our [FAQ](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).\n\n## Features\n\nGlowstone has a few key advantages over CraftBukkit:\n * It is **100% open source**. While CraftBukkit and most other mods are open\n   source, they rely on decompiled Minecraft source code. Glowstone\'s code is\n   completely original.\n * Because of this, it is easy to contribute to Glowstone\'s development. The\n   barrier of entry to contributions is lower because there is no need to work\n   around decompiled source or maintain a minimal diff.\n * Glowstone supports all plugins written for the Bukkit, Spigot and Paper APIs natively. In\n   practice, some plugins may try to make use of parts of the API which are not\n   yet implemented, but in a completed state Glowstone would support all Bukkit plugins.\n * Glowstone\'s simplicity affords it a performance improvement over CraftBukkit\n   and other servers, making it especially suited for situations where a large\n   amount of players must be supported but vanilla game features are not needed.\n \nHowever, there are several drawbacks:\n * Glowstone **is not finished**. Nothing is guaranteed to work, though many things\n   are likely to. If in doubt, file an issue.\n * Bukkit plugins which expect the presence of CraftBukkit-specific code\n   (that are in the `org.bukkit.craftbukkit` or `net.minecraft.server` packages)\n   will not work on Glowstone unless they are designed to fail gracefully.\n * Glowstone is not produced by the Bukkit team, and while we do make an effort\n   to produce quality work, Glowstone does not undergo the same rigorious testing\n   as the Bukkit project.\n   \nFor a current list of features, [check the wiki](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/wiki/Current-Features).\n\n## Downloads\n\nThe latest LTS and monthly releases, as well as a direct link to our latest build can be found on [our website](https://glowstone.net/#downloads).\n\nOlder releases can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/releases).\n\n## Building\n\n### 1. Setup\nAfter installing [Oracle JDK](https://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) (recommended) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/), and\n[Maven](https://maven.apache.org), checkout the source:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone\ncd Glowstone\n```\n\n### 2. Build\n\n```sh\n./scripts/build.sh\n```\n\nThe final jar will be placed in `target/` named `glowstone.jar`.\n\n## Running\n\nRunning Glowstone is simple because its dependencies are shaded into the output\njar at compile time. Simply execute `java -jar glowstone.jar` along with any\nextra JVM options desired (we recommend using `java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -XX:+UseG1GC -jar glowstone.jar`). A variety of command-line options are also available -\nrun `java -jar glowstone.jar --help` for more information.\n\nBy default, configuration is stored in the `config/` subdirectory and logs\nare stored in the `logs/` subdirectory. The main configuration file is\n`config/glowstone.yml`, which replaces CraftBukkit\'s `server.properties` and\n`bukkit.yml`. Settings from these two files will be copied over to Glowstone\'s\nconfiguration during the default configuration generation process.\n\nGlowstone uses [JLine](https://jline.github.io/jline2/) for console input and colored\nconsole output. The JLine console can be disabled in the configuration if a\nflat console is desired.\n\nNeed more help? Check out [our wiki](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/wiki#using-glowstone) for some guides that will help you with running,\nmaintaining and configuring your Glowstone server.\n\n## Playing\n\nFor those of you who just want to play on a Glowstone server, we have one available \nfor testing at `mc.glowstone.net`. Have fun!\n\n## Docs and Support\n\nThe best place to receive support is on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/issues).\nWhen reporting bugs, please retest and include whether the problem reproduces on:\n\n* Earlier [builds](https://circleci.com/gh/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone) of Glowstone\n\nJavadocs for Glowstone can be found [here](https://glowstone.net/jd/glowstone/).\n\nFor documentation on the Glowkit API (an updated Bukkit for Glowstone, based on the Paper API, compatible with Spigot\'s update to Bukkit), see the [Glowkit Javadocs](https://glowstone.net/jd/glowkit/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nFirst of all, thank you for your interest in advancing Glowstone!
