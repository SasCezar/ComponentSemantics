b'![Welcome to OpenComputers](assets/misc/banner.png)\n\nOpenComputers is a Minecraft mod that adds programmable computers and robots to the game. The built-in computer implementation uses Lua 5.2 and is fully persistent. This means programs will continue running across reloads. For more information, please [see the wiki][wiki]. Feel invited to visit the [community forums][forums] or drop by in the [IRC channel #oc on esper.net][irc].\n\nA few useful links:\n* [Minecraft Forum Thread][mcf]\n* [Downloads][releases]\n* [Bug Tracker][issues]\n* [Wiki][wiki]\n* [Ingame Manual][ingame manual]\n* [IRC][irc]\n* [Community Forums][forums]\n\n### Experimental Builds\nYou can find experimental builds [on the build server][jenkins]. Expect these to be generally more unstable than builds marked as releases. Use these **at your own risk**, but - when using the latest one - please *do* report bugs you encounter using them. Thanks!\n\n## License / Use in Modpacks\nThis mod is [licensed under the **MIT license**](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/blob/master-MC1.7.10/LICENSE). All **assets are public domain**, unless otherwise stated; all are free to be distributed as long as the license / source credits are kept. This means you can use this mod in any mod pack **as you please**. I\'d be happy to hear about you using it, though, just out of curiosity.\n\n## Contributing\n### Assets and Localizations\n1. **Translations**  \n   Translations to other languages are very much appreciated. You can find the localization files [in this folder][localizations]. If a localization you wanted to create already exists, please take the time to see if the present one is complete - the strings change every so often, invalidating some of the translations. If you start a fresh localization, please base it off of the English or German one, those are the \'master\' localization files. If you add a new language, please also add it to [the pack.mcmeta][pack.mcmeta] file. Keep it sorted alphabetically, use the name and region Minecraft itself uses. If you don\'t know how to do that, that\'s OK, I\'ll do it later.\n2. **Textures**  \n   If you would like to contribute better textures for certain items or blocks, feel free to pull-request them. If you would like to contribute *alternative* textures, make it a resource pack, and post it on the forums, for example.\n3. **Documentation**  \n   Help with keeping the [wiki][] up to date would be *really* appreciated. If you notice anything amiss and know better, fix it. If you don\'t ask someone who does, then fix it. If you had a question answered, consider adding that information somewhere in the wiki where you would have expected to find that information.  \n   There are also the files containing the ingame help [for programs][manpages] and [for blocks and items][manual], which could probably be much better than they are right now. Improvements to them, and new ones (e.g. for the libraries, such as `text` or `sides`) would help a lot. Thanks!\n4. **Robot Names**  \n   Robots get a random name when placed (unless set with an Anvil). The list the names are chose from [can be found here][robot names]. Feel free to pull request additional names! *However*: since the list has grown to a considerable length already, here are the two basic criteria for new names: it must either be a real or fictional robot, or an AI that at least *appears* to be self-aware.\n\n### Bug fixes, features and scripts\n1. **Bugs**  \n   If you\'ve found a bug, please report it in the [issue tracker][issues], after checking it has not been reported before - and possibly even fixed by now. If you think you can and have fixed it, feel free to do a pull request, I\'ll happily pull it if it looks all right to me - otherwise I\'ll gladly tell you what to change to get it merged.\n2. **Features**  \n   If you\'d like to propose a new feature, take it to the [forums][] or the [issue tracker][issues]. If you\'d like to contribute code that adds new features, please make sure to discuss the feature with me, first - again, the issue tracker is an OK place for this, there are a couple of feature requests there, already. Alternatively start a topic on the forums to discuss the feature, and / or stop by the [IRC][irc] to talk about it. Blind / unexpected feature pull requests might very well not make it, so save yourself some time by talking about it, first! Thanks.\n3. **Scripts / Programs**  \n   OpenComputers generates floppy disks in dungeon chests that can contain data from a selection of \'loot\' directories. For example, the IRC client and the Better Shell (besh) are two programs that can be found on such loot disks. If you\'d like to contribute a program that can be found this way, please have a look at [the loot readme][loot], which explains how to add custom loot. Simply pull request your loot!\n4. **Core Scripts**  \n   If you would like to contribute scripts to the "core" Lua code (which basically defines \'OpenOS\'), please have a look at the [code conventions][] for Lua to save us all some time. Bug fixes are always welcome. Additional programs and features should be kept small. Bigger programs (rule of thumb: larger than 3KiB) should go onto loot disks.\n5. **Drivers**  \n   As of OC 1.4, mod interaction that was previously provided by OpenComponents it now fully integrated into OC itself. If you wish to contribute a driver for blocks from other mods, cool! Have a look at the [integration][] package to get an idea of how to structure modules and read the readme in that package for more information (in particular on additional criteria to get your PR merged).\n\n#### Pull requests\nThe following are a few quick guidelines on pull requests. That is to say they are not necessarily *rules*, so there may be exceptions and all that. Just try to stick to those points as a baseline.\n- Make sure your code is formatted properly.\n- Make sure it builds and works.\n- Try to keep your changes as minimal as possible. In particular, no whitespace changes in existing files, please.\n- Feel free to code in Java, but don\'t be surprised if I convert it to Scala later on, if I feel it makes the code more concise ;-)\n- When adding mod dependencies, keep them *weak*, i.e. make sure OC still works without that mod. Also, prefer adding a Gradle dependency over adding API class files to the repo.\n- [Squash](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) your commits!\n\nAlso, and this should go without saying, your contributed code will also fall under OC\'s license, unless otherwise specified (in the super rare case of adding third-party stuff, add the according license information as a `LICENSE-???` file, please).\n\n## Extending\n### In your own mod\nTo use [the API][api] in your own mod, either get the API JAR from the [build server][jenkins], or if you\'re using [Gradle](http://gradle.org/), add a dependency to the maven repo:\n```groovy\nrepositories {\n    maven { url = "http://maven.cil.li/" }\n}\ndependencies {\n    compile "li.cil.oc:OpenComputers:MC1.7.10-1.5.+:api"\n}\n```\nAdjust the version number accordingly to the version you\'d like to build against.\n\nTo run the mod in your development environment, download the [`dev` JAR from the build server][dev-jar] and drop it into your development environment\'s `eclipse/mods` (Eclipse) or `run/mods` (IntelliJ IDEA) folder.\n\nAlternatively, leave out the `api` classifier and you can build against the dev JAR directly. This way you don\'t have to add it to your mods folder, but you will have to add `-Dfml.coreMods.load=li.cil.oc.common.launch.TransformerLoader` to the VM options in your run configuration.\n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask, either in the [forums][] or in the [IRC][irc]!\n\n### OpenComputers\nWant to tinker with the mod itself? Here is how - for IntelliJ IDEA users.\n\n**Important**\n- Make sure you have the Gradle plugin enabled in IntelliJ IDEA (File->Settings->Plugins).\n- Make sure you have the Scala plugin enabled.\n\nClone the repository, then in it run  \n`gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`  \nto setup the workspace, including assets and such, then  \n`gradlew idea`  \nto create an IntelliJ IDEA project.\n\nOpen the project and you will be asked to *import the Gradle project* (check your Event Log if you missed the pop-up). **Do so**. This will configure additionally referenced libraries.\n\nFor more specific instructions, read [Steps to run master MC1.7.10 from IDEA][idea_1.7.10]\n\nIn the case you wish to use Eclipse rather than IntelliJ IDEA, the process is mostly the same, except you must run `gradlew eclipse` rather than `gradlew idea`.\n\n\n\n[api]: https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/java/li/cil/oc/api\n[code conventions]: https://ocdoc.cil.li/lua_conventions\n[dev-jar]: https://ci.cil.li/view/OpenComputers/job/OpenComputers-MC1.7.10/\n[forums]: https://oc.cil.li/\n[irc]: http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=#oc\n[issues]: https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/issues?state=open\n[jenkins]: http://ci.cil.li/\n[localizations]: https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/lang\n[loot]: https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/loot\n[manpages]: https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/loot/OpenOS/usr/man\n[manual]: https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/doc\n[mcf]: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2201440-opencomputers-v122/\n[pack.mcmeta]: https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/blob/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/pack.mcmeta\n[releases]: https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/releases\n[robot names]: https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/blob/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/robot.names\n[wiki]: https://ocdoc.cil.li/\n[integration]: https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/scala/li/cil/oc/integration\n[ingame manual]: https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.7.10/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/doc\n[idea_1.7.10]: https://ocdoc.cil.li/tutorial:debug_1.7.10\n'
