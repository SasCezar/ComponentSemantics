b'### Minetrack \nMinetrack is a Minecraft PC/PE server tracker that lets you focus on what\'s happening *now*. \nBuilt to be lightweight and durable, you can easily adapt it to monitor BungeeCord or server instances.\n\n#### Try it out!\nYou can see an up-to-date copy of the production branch running on http://minetrack.me\n\n"master" branch contains everything you need to start your own copy. "production" branch is what\'s used in the production environment of the minetrack.me site.\n\n#### Usage\n1. Make sure everything is correct in ```config.json```.\n2. Add/remove servers by editing the ```servers.json``` file.\n3. Run ```npm install```.\n4. Run ```node app.js``` to boot the system (may need sudo!)\n\n(There\'s also ```install.sh``` and ```start.sh```, but they may not work for your OS.)\n\nDatabase logging is disabled by default. You can enable it in ```config.json``` by setting ```logToDatabase``` to true.\nThis requires sqlite3 drivers to be installed.\n\n#### What\'s being changed?\nFor the changelog, check out the [CHANGELOG](docs/CHANGELOG.md) file.'
