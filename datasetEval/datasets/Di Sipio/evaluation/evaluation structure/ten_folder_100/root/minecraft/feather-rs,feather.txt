b'# Feather\n[![build](https://dev.azure.com/caelunshun/feather/_apis/build/status/caelunshun.feather?branchName=develop)](https://dev.azure.com/caelunshun/feather/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=develop)\n[![coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/caelunshun/feather/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/caelunshun/feather)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/619316022800809995)](https://discordapp.com/invite/4eYmK69)\n\nAn experimental Minecraft server implementation written in Rust.\n\n### Features\nMany basic features are already implemented:\n- [x] Highly scalable architecture\n- [x] Anvil world loading and saving\n- [x] Physics\n- [x] Basic world generation\n- [x] Chunk streaming\n- [x] Day/night cycle\n- [x] Arrow shooting\n- [x] Falling blocks\n- [x] Block placement and breaking\n- [x] Item dropping and collection\n- [x] Chat\n- [x] Inventory handling\n- [x] Movement broadcasting\n\nDevelopment is currently quite active, and features should be added at a fast pace over the next few months.\n\n### Running\nWe offer precompiled binaries for Windows and Linux at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/caelunshun/feather/releases).\n\nTo run Feather:\n* Extract the downloaded archive.\n* Run the binary.\n  * On Linux and macOS: `./feather-server` in the server directory\n  * On Windows: double-click `feather-server.exe`\n  \nThe server will create a configuration file (`feather.toml`) which you can modify.\n\nFeather will generate a world by default. If you want to load a vanilla world,\ncopy the world save to the server directory under the name "world" (by default).\n\nWarning: Feather world persistence is fairly new and will likely cause problems\nwhen attempting to open Feather worlds in vanilla. Do not let Feather touch worlds\nyou care about unless they have been backed up.\n\nFeather currently only supports 1.13.2 clients and world saves. In the future, additional versions will be supported.\n\n### Compiling\nIf you are on another platform, compile the server yourself to try it out:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/caelunshun/feather\ncd feather\ncargo build --release\n```\n\nThe server executable will be located in `target/release`.\n'
