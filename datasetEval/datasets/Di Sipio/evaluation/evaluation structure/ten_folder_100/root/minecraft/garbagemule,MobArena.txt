It could take anything from\na couple of seconds to a day, but your message _will_ be seen.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nFound a bug, got a suggestion, or want to dig into the code base? There are\nmany ways to contribute to the project!\n\nGet started here: [Contributing](https://github.com/garbagemule/MobArena/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n"
