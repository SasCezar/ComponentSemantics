This makes minecraft servers more scalable.\nAnarchy servers can allow more players to join in without waiting in queue by using distributing server.\nIt written in `C#` with `.NET Core 2.0` env and based on `orleans` framework to work with released [1.12 protocol](https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-112-pre-release-6).\n\n**MineCase is not stable and lack of many features now. Please don\'t use MineCase in production unless you know what you\'re doing.**\n\n![Screenshots](screenshots/1.jpg)\n\n## Run Requirements\n* [.Net Core 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)\n* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)\n\n## Install (Build From Source)\n* 1 .
