b'# ReplayMod\nA Minecraft mod to record game sessions and replay them afterwards from any perspective.\n\n## Building\nMake sure your sub-projects are up-to-date: `git submodule update --init --recursive`\n\nAfter the initial clone, running `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` is necessary. This may take quite some time.\nThis will also be necessary if the `replaymod_at.cfg` file has been changed (getting errors about code that is trying \nto access private fields is a good indication that this has happened).\n\n### No IDE\nYou can build the mod by running `./gradlew build`. You can then find the final jar files in `versions/$MCVERSION/build/libs/`.\nYou can also build single versions by running `./gradlew :1.8:build` (builds the MC 1.8 version).\n\n### IntelliJ\nFor the initial setup run `./gradlew idea genIntellijRuns`.\nYou also need to enable the Mixin annotation processor:\n1. Go to File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors\n2. Tick "Enable annotation processing"\n3. Add a new entry to the "Annotation Processor options"\n4. Set the name to "reobfSrgFile" and the value to "$path/build/mcp-srg.srg" where you replace $path with the full \npath to the folder containing the gradlew file\n\nWhenever you switch to a different core version (see `:setCoreVersion` below), you can either just run `./gradlew idea` or instead run\n`./gradlew copySrg` and then refresh the gradle project from within IntelliJ.\n\n### Eclipse\n\n## Development\n### Branches\nLoosely based on [this branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) with `stable` instead of `master`.\n\nTL;DR:\nMain development happens on the `develop` branch, snapshots are built from this branch.\nThe `stable` branch contains the most recent release.\n\nThe `master` branch is solely to be used for the `version.json` file that contains a list of all versions\nused by the clients to check for updates of this mod.\n\n### The Preprocessor\nTo support multiple Minecraft versions with the ReplayMod, a [JCP](https://github.com/raydac/java-comment-preprocessor)-inspired preprocessor is used:\n```java\n        //#if MC>=11200\n        // This is the block for MC >= 1.12.0\n        category.addDetail(name, callable::call);\n        //#else\n        //$$ // This is the block for MC < 1.12.0\n        //$$ category.setDetail(name, callable::call);\n        //#endif\n```\nAny comments starting with `//$$` will automatically be introduced / removed based on the surrounding condition(s).\nNormal comments are left untouched. The `//#else` branch is optional.\n\nConditions can be nested arbitrarily but their indention shall always be equal to the indention of the code at the `//#if` line.\nThe `//$$` shall be aligned with the inner-most `//#if`.\n```java\n    //#if MC>=10904\n    public CPacketResourcePackStatus makeStatusPacket(String hash, Action action) {\n        //#if MC>=11002\n        return new CPacketResourcePackStatus(action);\n        //#else\n        //$$ return new CPacketResourcePackStatus(hash, action);\n        //#endif\n    }\n    //#else\n    //$$ public C19PacketResourcePackStatus makeStatusPacket(String hash, Action action) {\n    //$$     return new C19PacketResourcePackStatus(hash, action);\n    //$$ }\n    //#endif\n```\nCode for the more recent MC version shall be placed in the first branch of the if-else-construct.\nVersion-dependent import statements shall be placed separately from and after all other imports but before the `static` and `java.*` imports.\nCommon version dependent code (including the fml and forge event bus) are available as static methods/fields in the `MCVer` class.\n\nThe source code resides in `src/main` (gradle project `:core`) and is automatically passed through the\npreprocessor when any of the concrete versions are built (gradle projects `:1.8`, `:1.8.9`, etc.).\nDo **NOT** edit any of the code in `versions/$MCVERSION/build/` as it is automatically generated and will be overwritten without warning.\n\nYou can pass the original source code through the preprocessor if you wish to develop/debug with another version of Minecraft:\n```bash\n./gradle :1.9.4:setCoreVersion # switches all sources in src/main to 1.9.4\n```\nIf you do so, you\'ll also have to run `./gradlew :core:copySrg :core:setupDecompWorkspace :jGui:core:setupDecompWorkspace`,\nfollowed by a refresh of the project in your IDE.\n\nMake sure to switch back to the most recent branch before committing!\nCare should also be taken that switching to a different branch and back doesn\'t introduce any uncommitted changes (e.g. due to different indention, especially in case of nested conditions).\n\nThe `replaymod_at.cfg` file uses the same preprocessor but with different keywords (see already existent examples in that file).\nIf required, more file extensions and keywords can be added to the upstream implementation or the respective tasks.\n\n### Versioning\nThe ReplayMod uses the versioning scheme outlined [here](http://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/)\nwith three changes:\n- No `MAJORAPI`, the ReplayMod does not provide any external API\n- "Updating to a new Minecraft version" should not increment `MAJORMOD`, we maintain one version of the ReplayMod\nfor each version of Minecraft and all these versions share the same feature set (and most bugs). We therefore try to\nkeep the version name the same for all of them (with the exception of `MCVERSION` of course). This also means that the\n"Multiple Minecraft Version" section does not apply.\n- For pre-releases the shorter `-bX` is used instead of `-betaX`\n\nWhen a new version is (pre-)release, a new annotated tag should be added with the name of the version and the\n`versions.json` file in the `master` branch should be updated. To simplify this process the gradle task `doRelease` can\nbe used: `./gradlew -PreleaseVersion=2.0.0-rc1 doRelease`. It will create the tag and update the version.json\naccordingly.\n(**Dev Note**: The gradle task still needs to be updated, now that all versions are on a single branch!\nWe\'re also considering to change the naming of versions to be commit-based, rather than tag-based.\nSo you don\'t get a different version if you haven\'t pulled all the tags.)\n\nCare should be taken that the updated `version.json` is not pushed before a jar file is available on the\ndownload page (or Jenkins) as it will inform the users of the update.\n\n### Bugs\nBugs in the mod are tracked via [Bugzilla](https://bugs.replaymod.com/).\nGitHub should only be used for issues that are generally not likely to affect any end users.\n\nBug numbers in commits such as `(fixes #42)` refer to Bugzilla unless noted otherwise.\n\n## License\nThe ReplayMod is provided under the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 3 or (at your option) any later version.\nSee `LICENSE.md` for the full license text.\n'
