It provides several performance enhancements and fixes that are currently not available in Essentials and Spigot-Essentials. [For more details, see the wiki.](https://essentialsx.github.io/#/Improvements)\n\nEssentialsX is almost a completely drop-in replacement for Essentials. However, it has different requirements:\n\n* **EssentialsX requires [Vault](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/vault/) to enable chat prefix/suffixes and group support if you have a supported permissions plugin.** We recommend using [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.github.io).\n\n* **If you have an unsupported permissions plugin but still wish to use wildcards, enable `use-bukkit-permissions` in the configuration.** Otherwise, the plugin will fall back to config-based permissions.\n\n* **EssentialsX requires Java 8 or higher.** On older versions, the plugin may not work properly.\n\n* **EssentialsX supports Minecraft versions 1.8.8, 1.9.4, 1.10.2, 1.11.2, 1.12.2, 1.13.2 and 1.14.4.**\n\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nNeed help with using EssentialsX? Join the [MOSS Discord community](https://discord.gg/casfFyh) to ask for help and discuss EssentialsX.\n\nIf you need to report a bug or want to suggest a new feature, you can [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/issues/new/choose).\n\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\nEssentialsX builds against the Spigot/CraftBukkit server software for legacy support.\n\nTo compile EssentialsX, you first need to run [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools).\nThis only needs to be done once. There are two ways to do this:\n\n* Use the provided script at `scripts/buildtools.sh` to automatically download and run BuildTools if needed.\n* Download and run BuildTools yourself for versions `1.8` and `1.8.3`.\n\nNext, to build EssentialsX with Maven, run the following command:\n```\nmvn clean install\n```\n\nEach module\'s jar can be found in `target/` inside each module\'s directory.\n\nUsing EssentialsX in your plugin\n--------------------------------\n\nWriting a plugin and want to support EssentialsX? We have a Maven repository at https://ci.ender.zone/plugin/repository/everything/, and the EssentialsX artifact is `net.ess3:EssentialsX:2.17.0`. More information at the [wiki](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/wiki/Common-Issues#how-do-i-add-essentialsx-as-a-dependency).\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nWant to help improve EssentialsX?
