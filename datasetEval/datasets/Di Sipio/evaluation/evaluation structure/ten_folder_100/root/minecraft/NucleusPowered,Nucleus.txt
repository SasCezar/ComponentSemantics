b"Nucleus\n====\n\n* [Source]\n* [Issues]\n* [Website]\n* [Downloads]\n* [Documentation]\n* [TeamCity]\n* [Discord]\n\nLicence: [MIT](LICENSE.md) (except for the Nucleus logo, which is all rights reserved)\n\nNucleus is a Sponge plugin that forms a solid base for your server, providing essential commands, events, and other\ntidbits that you might need. Extremely configurable, only loading up the commands and modules you want (and providing a way for\nplugins to disable modules that they replace the functionality of), and providing a simple and rich API, Nucleus is an\nelite plugin for providing simple server tasks, and an essential addition to your server!\n\nNucleus is being actively developed for Sponge API 7. \n\nThe current active branches are:\n\n* sponge-api/7 (this branch - 1.12.2+)\n\n## Contributions\n\nAre you a talented programmer wanting to contribute some code? Perhaps someone who likes to write documentation? Do you \nhave a bug that you want to report? Or perhaps you have an idea for a cool new idea that would fit in with Nucleus? We'd\nbe grateful for your contributions - we're an open community that appreciates any help you are willing to give!\n\n* Read our [guidelines].\n* Open an issue if you have a bug to report, or a pull request with your changes.\n\n## Getting and Building Nucleus\n\nTo get a copy of the Nucleus source, ensure you have Git installed, and run the following commands from a command prompt\nor terminal:\n\n1. `git clone git@github.com:NucleusPowered/Nucleus.git`\n2. `cd Nucleus`\n3. `cp scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks`\n\nTo build Nucleus, navigate to the source directory and run either:\n\n* `./gradlew build` on UNIX and UNIX like systems (including macOS and Linux)\n* `gradlew build` on Windows systems\n\nYou will find the compiled JAR which will be named like `Nucleus-[version]-plugin.jar` in `output/`.\n\n## Building against the Nucleus API\n\nNucleus is available via a Maven repository.\n\n* Repo: `http://repo.drnaylor.co.uk/artifactory/list/minecraft`\n* Group ID: `io.github.nucleuspowered`\n* Artifact Name: `nucleus-api`\n\nThe versioning follows `version[-SNAPSHOT]-S(sponge-api)`. Add the `-SNAPSHOT` section for the latest snapshot.\n\nYou can also get Nucleus as a whole this way, but internals may break at any time. The API is guaranteed to be more stable.\n\nYou can also use [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#NucleusPowered/Nucleus) as a repository, if you prefer.\n\n## Third Party Libraries\n\nThe compiled Nucleus plugin includes the following libraries (with their licences in parentheses):\n\n* QuickStart Module Loader (MIT)\n\nSee [THIRDPARTY.md](THIRDPARTY.md) for more details.\n\n[Source]: https://github.com/NucleusPowered/Nucleus\n[Issues]: https://github.com/NucleusPowered/Nucleus/issues\n[Downloads]: https://github.com/NucleusPowered/Nucleus/releases\n[Website]: http://nucleuspowered.org/\n[Documentation]: http://nucleuspowered.org/docs\n[guidelines]: Contributing.md\n[TeamCity]: https://teamcity.drnaylor.co.uk/project.html?projectId=QuickStart&tab=projectOverview\n[Discord]: https://discord.gg/MC2mAuS\n"
