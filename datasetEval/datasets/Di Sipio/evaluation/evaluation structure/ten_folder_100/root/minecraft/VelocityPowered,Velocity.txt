b"# Velocity\n\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/jenkins/s/https/ci.velocitypowered.com/job/velocity.svg)](https://ci.velocitypowered.com/job/velocity/)\n[![Join our Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/472484458856185878.svg?logo=discord&label=)](https://discord.gg/8cB9Bgf)\n\nA Minecraft server proxy with unparalleled server support, scalability,\nand flexibility.\n\nVelocity is licensed under the MIT license for ultimate permissiveness\nand expanding the pool of potential contributors and users.\n\n## Goals\n\n* A codebase that is easy to dive into and consistently follows best practices\n  for Java projects as much as reasonably possible.\n* High performance: handle thousands of players on one proxy.\n* A new, refreshing API built from the ground up to be flexible and powerful\n  whilst avoiding design mistakes and suboptimal designs from other proxies.\n* First-class support for Paper, Sponge, and Forge. (Other implementations\n  may work, but we make every endeavor to support these server implementations\n  specifically.)\n  \n## Building\n\nVelocity is built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org). We recommend using the\nwrapper script (`./gradlew`) as our CI builds using it.\n\nIt is sufficient to run `./gradlew build` to run the full build cycle.\n\n## Running\n\nOnce you've built Velocity, you can copy and run the `-all` JAR from\n`proxy/build/libs`. Velocity will generate a default configuration file\nand you can configure it from there.\n\nAlternatively, you can get the proxy JAR from the [downloads](https://www.velocitypowered.com/downloads)\npage."
