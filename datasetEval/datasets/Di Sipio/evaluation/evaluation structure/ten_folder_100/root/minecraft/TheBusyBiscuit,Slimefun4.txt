b'# Slimefun 4\nSlimefun is a plugin which aims to basically turn your Bukkit Server into a modpack like FTB without installing a single mod. It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From Backpacks to Jetpacks!\nIt also adds an API allowing you guys to easily install/code Addons for this.\nYou own a Server which is not only minigame based and your players got bored of playing Survival?\nThen you will absolutely love this Plugin! \nIt adds a whole new layer of survival to your server by adding more than 400+ new Items!\n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Slimefun">\n    <img alt="bStats Servers" src="https://img.shields.io/bstats/servers/4574?color=%2344AD44&label=Servers%20using%20Slimefun4&logo=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.shields.io%2Fbstats%2Fservers%2F4574%3Fcolor%3D%252344AD44%26label%3DServers%2520using%2520Slimefun%2520right%2520now%26style%3Dfor-the-badge&style=for-the-badge">\n  </a>\n</p>\n\nSlimefun 4 is licensed under \n[GNU GPLv3](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n## Download Slimefun 4\nUse the stable builds, if your Server is heavily reliant on Slimefun not breaking.\nBut please also consider using development builds.
