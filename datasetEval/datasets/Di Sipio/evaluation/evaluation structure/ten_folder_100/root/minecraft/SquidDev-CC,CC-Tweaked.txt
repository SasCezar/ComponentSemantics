However, development of the original mod has slowed, as the original\ndevelopers have had less time to work on the mod, and moved onto other projects and commitments.\n\nCC: Tweaked (or CC:T for short) is an attempt to continue ComputerCraft\'s legacy. It\'s not intended to be a competitor\nto CC, nor do I want to take it in a vastly different direction to the original mod. Instead, CC:T focuses on making the\nComputerCraft experience as _solid_ as possible, ironing out any wrinkles that may have developed over time.\n\n## Features\nCC: Tweaked contains all the features of the latest version of ComputerCraft, as well as numerous fixes, performance\nimprovements and several nifty additions. I\'d recommend checking out [the releases page](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaked/releases)\nto see the full set of changes, but here\'s a couple of the more interesting additions:\n\n - Improvements to the `http` library, including websockets, support for other HTTP methods (`PUT`, `DELETE`, etc...)\n   and configurable limits on HTTP usage.\n - Full-block wired modems, allowing one to wrap non-solid peripherals (such as turtles, or chests if Plethora is\n   installed).\n - Pocket computers can be held like maps, allowing you to view the screen without entering a GUI.\n - Printed pages and books can be placed in item frames and held like maps.\n - Several profiling and administration tools for server owners, via the `/computercraft` command. This allows operators\n   to track which computers are hogging resources, turn on and shutdown multiple computers at once and interact with\n   computers remotely.\n - Closer emulation of standard Lua, adding the `debug` and `io` libraries. This also enables seeking within binary\n   files, meaning you don\'t need to read large files into memory.\n - Allow running multiple computers on multiple threads, reducing latency on worlds with many computers.\n\n## Relation to CCTweaks?\nThis mod has nothing to do with CCTweaks, though there is no denying the name is a throwback to it. That being said,\nseveral features have been included, such as full block modems, the Cobalt runtime and map-like rendering for pocket\ncomputers.\n\n## Contributing\nAny contribution is welcome, be that using the mod, reporting bugs or contributing code. In order to start helping\ndevelop CC:T, you\'ll need to follow these steps:\n\n - **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaked.git && cd CC-Tweaked`\n - **Setup Forge:** `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`\n - **Test your changes:** `./gradlew runClient` (or run the `GradleStart` class from your IDE).\n\nIf you want to run CC:T in a normal Minecraft instance, run `./gradlew build` and copy the `.jar` from `build/libs`.\n\n## Community\nIf you need help getting started with CC: Tweaked, want to show off your latest project, or just want to chat about\nComputerCraft we have a [forum](https://forums.computercraft.cc/) and [Discord guild](https://discord.gg/H2UyJXe)!\nThere\'s also a fairly populated, albeit quiet [IRC channel](http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=#computercraft), if\nthat\'s more your cup of tea.\n\nI\'d generally recommend you don\'t contact me directly (email, DM, etc...) unless absolutely necessary (i.e. in order to\nreport exploits). You\'ll get a far quicker response if you ask the whole community!\n\n## Using\nIf you want to depend on CC: Tweaked, we have a maven repo. However, you should be wary that some functionality is only\nexposed by CC:T\'s API and not vanilla ComputerCraft. If you wish to support all variations of ComputerCraft, I recommend\nusing [cc.crzd.me\'s maven](https://cc.crzd.me/maven/) instead.\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n  maven { url \'https://squiddev.cc/maven/\' }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n  implementation "org.squiddev:cc-tweaked-${mc_version}:${cct_version}"\n}\n```\n\nYou should also be careful to only use classes within the `dan200.computercraft.api` package. Non-API classes are\nsubject to change at any point. If you depend on functionality outside the API, file an issue, and we can look into\nexposing more features.\n'
