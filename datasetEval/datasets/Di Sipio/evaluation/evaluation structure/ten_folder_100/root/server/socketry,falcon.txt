b'# ![Falcon](logo.svg)\n\nFalcon is a multi-process, multi-fiber rack-compatible HTTP server built on top of [async], [async-io], [async-container] and [async-http]. Each request is executed within a lightweight fiber and can block on up-stream requests without stalling the entire server process. Falcon supports HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 natively.\n\n[Priority Business Support](#priority-business-support) is available.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/socketry/falcon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/socketry/falcon)\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/socketry/falcon.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/socketry/falcon)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/socketry/falcon/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/socketry/falcon)\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/join.svg)](https://gitter.im/socketry/falcon)\n\n[async]: https://github.com/socketry/async\n[async-io]: https://github.com/socketry/async-io\n[async-container]: https://github.com/socketry/async-container\n[async-http]: https://github.com/socketry/async-http\n\n## Motivation\n\nInitially, when I developed [async], I saw an opportunity to implement [async-http]: providing both client and server components. After experimenting with these ideas, I decided to build an actual web server for comparing and validating performance primarily out of interest. Falcon grew out of those experiments and permitted the ability to test existing real-world code on top of [async].\n\nOnce I had something working, I saw an opportunity to simplify my development, testing and production environments, replacing production (Nginx+Passenger) and development (Puma) with Falcon. Not only does this simplify deployment, it helps minimize environment-specific bugs.\n\nMy long term vision for Falcon is to make a web application platform which trivializes server deployment. Ideally, a web application can fully describe all it\'s components: HTTP servers, databases, periodic jobs, background jobs, remote management, etc. Currently, it is not uncommon for all these facets to be handled independently in platform specific ways. This can make it difficult to set up new instances as well as make changes to underlying infrastructure. I hope Falcon can address some of these issues in a platform agnostic way.\n\nAs web development is something I\'m passionate about, having a server like Falcon is empowering.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this line to your application\'s Gemfile:\n\n```ruby\ngem \'falcon\'\n```\n\nAnd then execute:\n\n\t$ bundle\n\nAlternatively, install in terminal:\n\n\t$ gem install falcon\n\n## Usage\n\n### Development\n\nYou can run `falcon serve` directly. It will load the `config.ru` and start serving on https://localhost:9292. Please [try the interactive online tutorial](https://katacoda.com/ioquatix/scenarios/falcon-introduction).\n\nThe `falcon serve` command has the following options for you to use:\n\n```\n$ falcon --help\nfalcon [--verbose | --quiet] [-h/--help] [-v/--version] <command>\n\tAn asynchronous HTTP server.\n\n\t[--verbose | --quiet]  Verbosity of output for debugging.\n\t[-h/--help]            Print out help information.\n\t[-v/--version]         Print out the application version.\n\t<command>              One of: serve, virtual.             Default: serve\n\n\tserve [-b/--bind <address>] [-p/--port <number>] [-h/--hostname <hostname>] [-t/--timeout <duration>] [--reuse-port] [-c/--config <path>] [--forked | --threaded | --hybrid] [-n/--count <count>] [--forks <count>] [--threads <count>]\n\t\tRun an HTTP server.\n\n\t\t[-b/--bind <address>]               Bind to the given hostname/address                               Default: https://localhost:9292\n\t\t[-p/--port <number>]                Override the specified port\n\t\t[-h/--hostname <hostname>]          Specify the hostname which would be used for certificates, etc.\n\t\t[-t/--timeout <duration>]           Specify the maximum time to wait for blocking operations.        Default: 60\n\t\t[--reuse-port]                      Enable SO_REUSEPORT if possible.                                 Default: false\n\t\t[-c/--config <path>]                Rackup configuration file to load                                Default: config.ru\n\t\t[--forked | --threaded | --hybrid]  Select a specific parallelism model                              Default: forked\n\t\t[-n/--count <count>]                Number of instances to start.                                    Default: 8\n\t\t[--forks <count>]                   Number of forks (hybrid only).\n\t\t[--threads <count>]                 Number of threads (hybrid only).\n```\n\nTo run on a different port:\n\n```\n$ falcon serve --port 3000\n```\n\n### Virtual Hosts\n\nFalcon can replace Nginx as a virtual server for Ruby applications. **This is an experimental feature**.\n\n```\n/--------------------\\\n|   Client Browser   |\n\\--------------------/\n          ||          \n  (TLS + HTTP/2 TCP)\n          ||          \n/--------------------\\\n| Falcon Proxy (SNI) |\n\\--------------------/\n          ||          \n  (HTTP/2 UNIX PIPE)\n          ||          \n/--------------------\\\n| Application Server |   (Rack Compatible)\n\\--------------------/\t\n```\n\nYou need to create a `falcon.rb` configuration in the root of your application, and start the virtual host:\n\n```\n$ cat /srv/http/example.com/falcon.rb\n#!/usr/bin/env -S falcon host\n\nload :rack, :lets_encrypt_tls, :supervisor\n\nrack \'hello.localhost\', :lets_encrypt_tls\n\nsupervisor\n\n% falcon virtual /srv/http/example.com/falcon.rb\n```\n\nThe falcon virtual server is hard coded to redirect http traffic to https, and will serve each application using an internal SNI-based proxy.\n\n### Integration with Rails\n\nFalcon works perfectly with `rails` apps.\n\n1. Add `gem \'falcon\'` to your `Gemfile` and perhaps remove `gem \'puma\'` once you are satisfied with the change.\n\n2. Run `falcon serve` to start a local development server.\n\nAlternatively run `RACK_HANDLER=falcon rails server` to start the server (at least, until [rack#1181](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1181) is merged).\n\n#### Thread Safety\n\nWith older versions of Rails, the `Rack::Lock` middleware can be inserted into your app by Rails. `Rack::Lock`will cause both poor performance and deadlocks due to the highly concurrent nature of `falcon`. Other web frameworks are generally unaffected.\n\n##### Rails 3.x (and older)\n\nPlease ensure you specify `config.threadsafe!` in your `config/application.rb`:\n\n```ruby\nmodule MySite\n\tclass Application < Rails::Application\n\t\t# ...\n\t\t\n\t\t# Enable threaded mode\n\t\tconfig.threadsafe!\n\tend\nend\n```\n\n##### Rails 4.x\n\nPlease ensure you have `config.allow_concurrency = true` in your configuration.\n\n##### Rails 5.x+\n\nThis became the default in Rails 5 so no change is necessary unless you explicitly disabled concurrency, in which case you should remove that configuration.\n\n### WebSockets\n\nFalcon supports (partial and full) `rack.hijack` for both for HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 connections. You can thus use [async-websocket] in any controller layer to serve WebSocket connections.\n\n[async-websocket]: https://github.com/socketry/async-websocket\n\n#### ActionCable\n\nThe `rack.hijack` functionality is compatible with ActionCable. If you use the `async` adapter, you should run falcon in threaded mode, or in forked mode with `--count 1`. Otherwise, your messaging system will be distributed over several processes with no IPC mechanism. You might like to try out [async-redis](https://github.com/socketry/async-redis) as an asynchronous message bus.\n\n### Early Hints\n\nFalcon supports the `rack.early_hints` API when running over HTTP/2.\n\n### Integration with Guard\n\nFalcon can restart very quickly and is ideal for use with guard. See [guard-falcon] for more details.\n\n[guard-falcon]: https://github.com/socketry/guard-falcon\n\n### Integration with Capybara\n\nFalcon can run in the same process on a different thread, so it\'s great for use with Capybara (and shared ActiveRecord transactions). See [falcon-capybara] for more details.\n\n[falcon-capybara]: https://github.com/socketry/falcon-capybara\n\n### Using with Rackup\n\nYou can invoke Falcon via `rackup`:\n\n\trackup --server falcon\n\nThis will run a single-threaded instance of Falcon using `http/1`. While it works fine, it\'s not recommended to use `rackup` with `falcon`, because performance will be limited.\n\n### Self-Signed TLS with Curl\n\nIn order to use `curl` with self-signed localhost certificates, you need to specify `--insecure` or the path of the certificate to validate the request:\n\n```\n> curl -v https://localhost:9292 --cacert ~/.localhost/localhost.crt\n*   Trying ::1...\n* TCP_NODELAY set\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 9292 (#0)\n* ALPN, offering http/1.1\n* Cipher selection: ALL:!EXPORT:!EXPORT40:!EXPORT56:!aNULL:!LOW:!RC4:@STRENGTH\n* successfully set certificate verify locations:\n*   CAfile: /Users/samuel/.localhost/localhost.crt\n  CApath: none\n* TLSv1.2 (OUT), TLS header, Certificate Status (22):\n* TLSv1.2 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):\n* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):\n* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS handshake, Certificate (11):\n* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS handshake, Server key exchange (12):\n* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS handshake, Request CERT (13):\n* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS handshake, Server finished (14):\n* TLSv1.2 (OUT), TLS handshake, Certificate (11):\n* TLSv1.2 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client key exchange (16):\n* TLSv1.2 (OUT), TLS change cipher, Change cipher spec (1):\n* TLSv1.2 (OUT), TLS handshake, Finished (20):\n* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS change cipher, Change cipher spec (1):\n* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS handshake, Finished (20):\n* SSL connection using TLSv1.2 / ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384\n* ALPN, server accepted to use http/1.1\n* Server certificate:\n*  subject: O=Development/CN=localhost\n*  start date: Aug 10 00:31:43 2018 GMT\n*  expire date: Aug  7 00:31:43 2028 GMT\n*  subjectAltName: host "localhost" matched cert\'s "localhost"\n*  issuer: O=Development/CN=localhost\n*  SSL certificate verify ok.\n> GET / HTTP/1.1\n> Host: localhost:9292\n> User-Agent: curl/7.63.0\n> Accept: */*\n> \n< HTTP/1.1 301\n< location: /index\n< cache-control: max-age=86400\n< content-length: 0\n< \n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\n```\n\n## Performance\n\nFalcon uses an asynchronous event-driven reactor to provide non-blocking IO. It can handle an arbitrary number of in-flight requests with minimal overhead per request.\n\nIt uses one Fiber per request, which yields in the presence of blocking IO.\n\n- [Improving Ruby Concurrency](https://www.codeotaku.com/journal/2018-06/improving-ruby-concurrency/index#performance) \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of Falcon and Puma.\n\n### Memory Usage\n\nFalcon uses a pre-fork model which loads the entire rack application before forking. This reduces per-process memory usage. \n\n[async-http] has been designed carefully to minimize IO related garbage. This avoids large per-request memory allocations or disk usage, provided that you use streaming IO.\n\n### System Limitations\n\nIf you are expecting to handle many simultaneous connections, please ensure you configure your file limits correctly.\n\n```\nErrno::EMFILE: Too many open files - accept(2)\n```\n\nThis means that your system is limiting the number of files that can be opened by falcon. Please check the `ulimit` of your system and set it appropriately.\n\n## Priority Business Support\n\nFalcon can be an important part of your business or project, both improving performance and saving money.
