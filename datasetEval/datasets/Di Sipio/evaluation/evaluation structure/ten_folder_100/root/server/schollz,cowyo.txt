The most important feature here is _simplicity_. Other features include versioning, page locking, self-destructing messages, encryption, and listifying. You can [download *cowyo* as a single executable](https://github.com/schollz/cowyo/releases/latest) or install it with Go. Try it out at https://cowyo.com.\n\nThere is now [a command-line tool, *cowyodel*](https://github.com/schollz/cowyodel) to interact with *cowyo* and transfer information between computers with only a code phrase: [schollz/cowyodel](https://github.com/schollz/cowyodel).\n\nGetting Started\n===============\n\n## Install\n\nIf you have go\n\n```\ngo get -u github.com/schollz/cowyo/...\n```\n\nor just [download the latest release](https://github.com/schollz/cowyo/releases/latest).\n\n## Run\n\nTo run just double click or from the command line:\n\n```\ncowyo\n```\n\nand it will start a server listening  on `0.0.0.0:8050`. To view it, just go to http://localhost:8050 (the server prints out the local IP for your info if you want to do LAN networking). You can change the port with `-port X`, and you can listen *only* on localhost using `-host localhost`.\n\n**Running with TLS**\n\nSpecify a matching pair of SSL Certificate and Key to run cowyo using https. *cowyo* will now run in a secure session. \n\n*N.B. Let\'s Encrypt is a CA that signs free and signed certificates.*\n\n```\ncowyo --cert "/path/to/server.crt" --key "/p/t/server.key"\n```\n\n**Running with Docker**\n\nYou can easily get started with Docker. First pull the latest image and create the volume with:\n\n```\ndocker run -d -v /directory/to/data:/data -p 8050:8050 schollz/cowyo\n```\n\nThen you can stop it with `docker stop cowyo` and start it again with `docker start cowyo`.\n\n## Server customization\n\nThere are a couple of command-line flags that you can use to make *cowyo* your own micro-CMS. \n\n```\ncowyo -lock 123 -default-page index.html -css mystyle.css -diary\n```\n\nThe `-lock` flag will automatically lock every page with the passphrase "123". Also, the default behavior will be to redirect `/` to `/index.html`. Also, every page that is published will automatically redirect to `/mypage/read` which will show the custom CSS file if it is supplied with `-css`. The `-diary` flag allows you to generate a time-stamped page instead of a random named page when you select "New".\n\n## Usage\n\n*cowyo* is straightforward to use. Here are some of the basic features:\n\n### Publishing \n\nIf you hover the the top left button (the name of the page) you will see the option "Publish". Publishing will add the page to the `sitemap.xml` for crawlers to find. It will also default that page to go to the `/read` route so it can be easily viewed as a single page.\n\n### View all the pages\n\nTo view the current list of all the pages goto to `/ls`.\n\n### Editing\n\nWhen you open a document you\'ll be directed to an alliterative animal (which is supposed to be easy to remember). You can write in Markdown. Saving is performed as soon as you stop writing. You can easily link pages using [[PageName]] as you edit.\n\n![Editing](http://i.imgur.com/vEs2U8z.gif)\n\n### History\n\nYou can easily see previous versions of your documents.\n\n![History](http://i.imgur.com/CxhRkyo.gif)\n\n### Lists\n\nYou can easily make lists and check them off.\n\n![Lists](http://i.imgur.com/7xbauy8.gif)\n\n### Locking\n\nLocking prevents other users from editing your pages without a passphrase.\n\n![Locking](http://i.imgur.com/xwUFV8b.gif)\n\n### Encryption\n\nEncryption is performed using AES-256.\n\n![Encryption](http://i.imgur.com/rWoqoLB.gif)\n\n### Self-destructing pages\n\nJust like in mission impossible.\n\n![Self-destructing](http://i.imgur.com/upMxFQh.gif)\n\n\n## Development\n\nYou can run the tests using\n\n```\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/schollz/cowyo\n$ go test ./...\n```\n\nAny contributions are welcome.\n\n## Thanks\n\n...to [DanielHeath](https://github.com/DanielHeath) who has introduced some stellar improvements into cowyo including supporting category pages, hot-template reloading, preventing out-of-order updates, added password access, fade-out on deleting list items, and image upload support!\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n'
