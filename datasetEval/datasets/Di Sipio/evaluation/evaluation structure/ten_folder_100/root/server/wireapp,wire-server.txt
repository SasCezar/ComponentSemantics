Compile sources natively.\n\nThis requires a range of dependencies that depend on your platform/OS, such as:\n\n- Haskell & Rust compiler and package managers\n- Some package dependencies (libsodium, openssl, protobuf, icu, geoip, snappy, [cryptobox-c](https://github.com/wireapp/cryptobox-c), ...) that depend on your platform/OS\n\nSee [docs/developer/dependencies.md](docs/developer/dependencies.md) for details.\n\nOnce all dependencies are set up, the following should succeed:\n\n```bash\n# build all haskell services\nmake\n# build one haskell service, e.g. brig:\ncd services/brig && make\n```\n\nThe default make target (`fast`) compiles unoptimized (faster compilation time, slower binaries), which should be fine for development purposes. Use `make install` to get optimized binaries.\n\nFor building nginz, see [services/nginz/README.md](services/nginz/README.md)\n\n#### 2. Use docker\n\n*If you don\'t wish to build all docker images from scratch (e.g. the `alpine-builder` takes a very long time), ready-built images can be downloaded from [here](https://quay.io/organization/wire).*\n\nIf you wish to build your own docker images, you need [docker version >= 17.05](https://www.docker.com/) and [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). Then,\n\n```bash\n# optionally:\n# make docker-builder # if you don\'t run this, it pulls the alpine-builder image from quay.io\nmake docker-deps docker-intermediate docker-services\n\n# subsequent times, after changing code, if you wish to re-create docker images, it\'s sufficient to\nmake docker-intermediate docker-services\n```\n\nwill, eventually, have built a range of docker images. Make sure to [give Docker enough RAM](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/issues/562); if you see `make: *** [builder] Error 137`, it might be a sign that the build ran out of memory. You can also mix and match \xe2\x80\x93 e.g. pull the [`alpine-builder`](https://quay.io/repository/wire/alpine-builder?tab=tags) image and build the rest locally.\n\nSee the `Makefile`s and `Dockerfile`s, as well as [build/alpine/README.md](build/alpine/README.md) for details.\n\n### How to run integration tests\n\nIntegration tests require all of the haskell services (brig, galley, cannon, gundeck, proxy, cargohold, spar) to be correctly configured and running, before being able to execute e.g. the `brig-integration` binary. This requires most of the deployment dependencies as seen in the architecture diagram to also be available:\n\n- Required internal dependencies:\n    - cassandra (with the correct schema)\n    - elasticsearch (with the correct schema)\n    - redis\n- Required external dependencies are the following configured AWS services (or "fake" replacements providing the same API):\n    - SES\n    - SQS\n    - SNS\n    - S3\n    - DynamoDB\n- Required additional software:\n    - netcat (in order to allow the services being tested to talk to the dependencies above)\n\nSetting up these real, but in-memory internal and "fake" external dependencies is done easiest using [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Run the following in a separate terminal (it will block that terminal, C-c to shut all these docker images down again):\n\n```\ndeploy/dockerephemeral/run.sh\n```\n\nThen, to run all integration tests:\n\n```bash\nmake integration\n```\n\nOr, alternatively, `make` on the top-level directory (to produce all the service\'s binaries) followed by e.g `cd services/brig && make integration` to run one service\'s integration tests only.\n\n### when you need more fine-grained control over your build-test loops\n\nYou can use `$WIRE_STACK_OPTIONS` to pass arguments to stack through the `Makefile`s.  This is useful to e.g. pass arguments to a unit test suite or temporarily disable `-Werror` without the risk of accidentally committing anything, like this:\n\n```bash\nWIRE_STACK_OPTIONS=\'--ghc-options=-Wwarn --test-arguments="--quickcheck-tests=19919 --quickcheck-replay=651712"\' make -C services/gundeck\n```\n\nIntegration tests are run via `/services/integration.sh`, which does not know about stack or `$WIRE_STACK_OPTIONS`.  Here you can use `$WIRE_INTEGRATION_TEST_OPTIONS`:\n\n```bash\ncd services/spar\nWIRE_INTEGRATION_TEST_OPTIONS="--match=\'POST /identity-providers\'" make i\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use [tasty\'s support for passing arguments vie shell variables directly](https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty#runtime).  Or, in the case of spar, the [hspec equivalent](https://hspec.github.io/options.html#specifying-options-through-an-environment-variable), which [is less helpful at times](https://github.com/hspec/hspec/issues/335).\n\n## How to install and run `wire-server`\n\nYou have two options:\n\n* Option 1. (recommended) Install wire-server on kubernetes using the configuration and instructions provided in [wire-server-deploy](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server-deploy). This is the best option to run it on a server and recommended if you want to self-host wire-server.\n* Option 2. Compile everything in this repo, then you can use the [docker-compose based demo](deploy/services-demo/README.md). This option is intended as a way to try out wire-server on your local development machine and is less suited when you want to install wire-server on a server.\n'
