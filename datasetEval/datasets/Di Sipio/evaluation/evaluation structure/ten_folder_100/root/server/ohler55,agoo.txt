This gem flies. It is a high\nperformance HTTP server that serves static resource at hundreds of thousands\nof fetches per second. A simple hello world Ruby handler at over 100,000\nrequests per second on a desktop computer. That places Agoo at about 85 times\nfaster than Sinatra and 1000 times faster than Rails. In both cases the\nlatency was two orders of magnitude lower or more. Checkout the\n[benchmarks](http://opo.technology/benchmarks.html#web_benchmarks). Note that\nthe benchmarks had to use a C program called\n[Perfer](https://github.com/ohler55/perfer) to hit the Agoo limits. Ruby\nbenchmarks driver could not push Agoo hard enough.\n\nAgoo supports the [Ruby rack API](https://rack.github.io) which allows for the\nuse of rack compatible gems such as Hanami and Rails. Agoo also supports WebSockets and SSE.\n\nAgoo is not available on Windows.\n\n## News\n\n- Version 2.11.0 supports GraphQL subscriptions. TLS (SSL,HTTPS)\n  support added. Examples for both. Related, the\n  [graphql-benchmark](https://github.com/the-benchmarker/graphql-benchmarks)\n  repo was given to [the-benchmarker](https://github.com/the-benchmarker).\n\n- Agoo has a new GraphQL module with a simple, easy to use\n  API. Checkout the [hello](example/graphql/hello.rb) or\n  [song](example/graphql/song.rb) examples.\n  [An Instrumental Intro to GraphQL with Ruby](https://blog.appsignal.com/2019/01/29/graphql.html)\n  is a walk through.\n\n- Agoo takes first place as the highest throughput on [web-frameworks\n  benchmarks](https://github.com/the-benchmarker/web-frameworks). Latency was\n  not at the top but release 2.5.2 improves that. The Agoo-C benchmarks it at\n  the top. The fastest web server across all languages.\n\n- Clustered Agoo is ready. For slower application and a machine with multiple\n  cores a significant improvement is performance is realized. The application\n  must be stateless in that no data is shared between workers.\n\n- WebSocket and SSE are supported and a PR has been submitted to updated the\n  Rack spec. Go over to the [proposed Rack\n  extension](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1272) and give it a look and a\n  thumbs-up or heart if you like it.\n\n- Agoo now serves Rails static assets more than 8000 times faster than the\n  default Puma. Thats right, [8000 times faster](misc/rails.md).\n\n## Releases\n\nSee [file:CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)\n\nReleases are made from the master branch. The default branch for checkout is\nthe develop branch. Pull requests should be made against the develop branch.\n\n## Support\n\n[Get supported Agoo with a Tidelift Subscription.](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/rubygems-agoo?utm_source=rubygems-agoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme) Security updates are [supported](https://tidelift.com/security).\n\n## Links\n\n - *Documentation*: http://rubydoc.info/gems/agoo or http://www.ohler.com/agoo/doc/index.html\n\n - *GitHub* *repo*: https://github.com/ohler55/agoo\n\n - *RubyGems* *repo*: https://rubygems.org/gems/agoo\n\n - *WABuR* *repo*: https://github.com/ohler55/wabur has an option to use Agoo\n\n - *Perfer* *repo*: https://github.com/ohler55/perfer\n\nFollow [@peterohler on Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/peterohler) for announcements and news about the Agoo gem.\n'
