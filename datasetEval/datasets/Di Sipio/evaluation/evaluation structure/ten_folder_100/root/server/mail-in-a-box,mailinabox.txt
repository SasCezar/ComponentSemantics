b'Mail-in-a-Box\n=============\n\nBy [@JoshData](https://github.com/JoshData) and [contributors](https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/graphs/contributors).\n\nMail-in-a-Box helps individuals take back control of their email by defining a one-click, easy-to-deploy SMTP+everything else server: a mail server in a box.\n\n**Please see [https://mailinabox.email](https://mailinabox.email) for the project\'s website and setup guide!**\n\n* * *\n\nOur goals are to:\n\n* Make deploying a good mail server easy.\n* Promote [decentralization](http://redecentralize.org/), innovation, and privacy on the web.\n* Have automated, auditable, and [idempotent](https://sharknet.us/2014/02/01/automated-configuration-management-challenges-with-idempotency/) configuration.\n* **Not** make a totally unhackable, NSA-proof server.\n* **Not** make something customizable by power users.\n\nAdditionally, this project has a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which supersedes the goals above. Please review it when joining our community.\n\nThe Box\n-------\n\nMail-in-a-Box turns a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64-bit machine into a working mail server by installing and configuring various components.\n\nIt is a one-click email appliance. There are no user-configurable setup options. It "just works".\n\nThe components installed are:\n\n* SMTP ([postfix](http://www.postfix.org/)), IMAP ([dovecot](http://dovecot.org/)), CardDAV/CalDAV ([Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)), Exchange ActiveSync ([z-push](http://z-push.org/))\n* Webmail ([Roundcube](http://roundcube.net/)), static website hosting ([nginx](http://nginx.org/))\n* Spam filtering ([spamassassin](https://spamassassin.apache.org/)), greylisting ([postgrey](http://postgrey.schweikert.ch/))\n* DNS ([nsd4](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/nsd/)) with [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework), DKIM ([OpenDKIM](http://www.opendkim.org/)), [DMARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC), [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSSEC), [DANE TLSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities), and [SSHFP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4255) records automatically set\n* Backups ([duplicity](http://duplicity.nongnu.org/)), firewall ([ufw](https://launchpad.net/ufw)), intrusion protection ([fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)), system monitoring ([munin](http://munin-monitoring.org/))\n\nIt also includes:\n\n* A control panel and API for adding/removing mail users, aliases, custom DNS records, etc. and detailed system monitoring.\n\nFor more information on how Mail-in-a-Box handles your privacy, see the [security details page](security.md).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nSee the [setup guide](https://mailinabox.email/guide.html) for detailed, user-friendly instructions.\n\nFor experts, start with a completely fresh (really, I mean it) Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64-bit machine. On the machine...\n\nClone this repository:\n\n\t$ git clone https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox\n\t$ cd mailinabox\n\n_Optional:_ Download Josh\'s PGP key and then verify that the sources were signed\nby him:\n\n\t$ curl -s https://keybase.io/joshdata/key.asc | gpg --import\n\tgpg: key C10BDD81: public key "Joshua Tauberer <jt@occams.info>" imported\n\n\t$ git verify-tag v0.43\n\tgpg: Signature made ..... using RSA key ID C10BDD81\n\tgpg: Good signature from "Joshua Tauberer <jt@occams.info>"\n\tgpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!\n\tgpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.\n\tPrimary key fingerprint: 5F4C 0E73 13CC D744 693B  2AEA B920 41F4 C10B DD81\n\nYou\'ll get a lot of warnings, but that\'s OK. Check that the primary key fingerprint matches the\nfingerprint in the key details at [https://keybase.io/joshdata](https://keybase.io/joshdata)\nand on his [personal homepage](https://razor.occams.info/). (Of course, if this repository has been compromised you can\'t trust these instructions.)\n\nCheckout the tag corresponding to the most recent release:\n\n\t$ git checkout v0.43\n\nBegin the installation.\n\n\t$ sudo setup/start.sh\n\nFor help, DO NOT contact Josh directly --- I don\'t do tech support by email or tweet (no exceptions).\n\nPost your question on the [discussion forum](https://discourse.mailinabox.email/) instead, where maintainers and Mail-in-a-Box users may be able to help you.\n\nContributing and Development\n----------------------------\n\nMail-in-a-Box is an open source project.
