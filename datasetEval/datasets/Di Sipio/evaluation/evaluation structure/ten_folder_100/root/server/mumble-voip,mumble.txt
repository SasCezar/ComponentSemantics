The client works on Win32/64, Linux and Mac OS X, while the\nserver should work on anything Qt can be installed on.\n\nNote that when we say Win32, we mean Windows XP or newer.\n\n## Running Mumble\n\nOn Windows, after installation, you should have a new Mumble folder in your\nStart Menu, from which you can start Mumble.\n\nOn Mac OS X, to install Mumble, drag the application from the downloaded\ndisk image into your `/Applications` folder.\n\nOnce Mumble is launched, you need a server to connect to. Either create your\nown or join a friend's.\n\n## Running Murmur on Unix-like systems\n\nMurmur should be run from the command line, so start a shell (command prompt)\nand go to wherever you installed Mumble. Run murmur as\n\n```\nmurmurd [-supw <password>] [-ini <inifile>] [-fg] [v]\n\n-supw   Set a new password for the user SuperUser, which is hardcoded to\n        bypass ACLs. Keep this password safe. Until you set a password,\n        the SuperUser is disabled. If you use this option, murmur will\n        set the password in the database and then exit.\n\n-ini    Use an inifile other than murmur.ini, use this to run several instances\n        of murmur from the same directory. Make sure each instance is using\n        a separate database.\n\n-fg     Run in the foreground, logging to standard output.\n\n-v      More verbose logging.\n```\n\n## Running Murmur on Mac OS X\n\nMurmur is distributed separately from the Mumble client on Mac OS X.\nIt is called Static OS X Server and can be downloaded from the main webpage.\n\nOnce downloaded it can be run in the same way as on any other Unix-like system.\nFor more information please see the 'Running Murmur on Unix-like systems' above.\n\n## Running Murmur on Win32\n\nDoubleclick the Murmur icon to start murmur. There will be a small icon on your\ntaskbar from which you can view the log.\n\nTo set the superuser password, run murmur with the parameters `-supw <password>`.\n\n## Bandwidth usage\n\nMumble will use 10-40 kbit/s outgoing, and the same incoming for each user.\nSo if there are 10 other users on the server with you, your incoming\nbandwidth requirement will be 100-400 kbit/s if they all talk at the same time.\n"
