Are you positive none of the \'test\' emails are addressed to colleagues or worse, customers? Of course, you can setting up and maintain a test email server for development -- but that\'s a chore. Plus, the delay when you are waiting to view new test emails can radically slow your development cycle.\n\n## Papercut to the rescue!\nPapercut is a 2-in-1 quick email viewer AND built-in SMTP server (designed to receive messages only). Not only does it not enforce any restrictions how you prepare your email, but it allows you to view the whole email-chilada: body, html, headers, attachment down right down to the naughty raw encoded bits. Papercut can be configured to run on startup and sit quietly (minimized in the tray) only providing a notification when a new message has arrived.\n\n## Download Now\n#### [Latest Release](https://github.com/ChangemakerStudios/Papercut/releases)\nDownload Papercut.Setup.exe installer.\n\n## Features\n#### Instant Feedback When New Email Arrives\n![Instant Feedback When New Email Arrives](https://changemakerstudios.us/images/Papercut/Papercut-v3.1.0-S2.png)\n#### Rich and Detailed View of Received Email\n![Rich and Detailed View of Received Email](https://changemakerstudios.us/images/Papercut/Papercut-Main.png)\n#### View and Download the Mime Sections of your Email\n![View and Download the Mime Sections of your Email](https://changemakerstudios.us/images/Papercut/Papercut-Mime.png)\n#### In Version 4 the Raw View Returns\n![In Version 4 the Raw View Returns](https://changemakerstudios.us/images/Papercut/Papercut-Raw.png)\n#### New in Version 4.4: Logging View\n![In Version 4.4: Logging View](https://changemakerstudios.us/images/Papercut/Papercut-Log.png)\n\n## Papercut Background Service\nPapercut has an optional "always on" service to receive emails even when the client is not running.
