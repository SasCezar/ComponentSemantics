b"![Oragono logo](docs/logo.png)\n\nOragono is a modern, experimental IRC server written in Go. It's designed to be simple to setup and use, and it includes features such as UTF-8 nicks / channel names, client accounts with SASL, and other assorted IRCv3 support.\n\nOragono is a fork of the [Ergonomadic](https://github.com/edmund-huber/ergonomadic) IRC daemon <3\n\n---\n\n[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/oragono/oragono)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/oragono/oragono)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oragono/oragono.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oragono/oragono)\n[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-latest%20release-green.svg)](https://github.com/oragono/oragono/releases/latest)\n[![Freenode #oragono](https://img.shields.io/badge/Freenode-%23oragono-1e72ff.svg?style=flat)](https://www.irccloud.com/invite?channel=%23oragono&hostname=irc.freenode.net&port=6697&ssl=1)\n[![Crowdin](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/oragono/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/oragono)\n\n[darwin.network](https://irc.darwin.network/) and [testnet.oragono.io](ircs://testnet.oragono.io:6697/#chat) are running Oragono in production if you want to take a look.\n\n---\n\n\n## Features\n\n* UTF-8 nick and channel names with rfc7613 (PRECIS)\n* [yaml](http://yaml.org/) configuration\n* native TLS/SSL support\n* updating server config and TLS certificates on-the-fly (rehashing)\n* user accounts and SASL\n* supports [multiple languages](https://crowdin.com/project/oragono) (you can also set a default language for your network)\n* integrated services: NickServ for user accounts, ChanServ for channel registration, and HostServ for vanity hosts\n* experimental support for bouncer-like features (storing and replaying history, allowing multiple clients to use the same nickname)\n* advanced security and privacy features (support for requiring SASL for all logins, cloaking IPs, and running as a Tor hidden service)\n* an extensible privilege system for IRC operators\n* ident lookups for usernames\n* automated client connection limits\n* passwords stored with [bcrypt](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto)\n* banning ips/nets and masks with `KLINE` and `DLINE`\n* [IRCv3 support](http://ircv3.net/software/servers.html)\n* a heavy focus on developing with [specifications](https://oragono.io/specs.html)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo go through the standard installation, download the latest release from this page: https://github.com/oragono/oragono/releases/latest\n\nExtract it into a folder, then run the following commands:\n\n```sh\ncp oragono.yaml ircd.yaml\nvim ircd.yaml  # modify the config file to your liking\noragono mkcerts\n```\n\n**Note:** For setting up proper Let's Encrypt certificates, we've got [this manual entry](https://github.com/oragono/oragono/blob/master/docs/MANUAL.md#how-do-i-use-lets-encrypt-certificates).\n\n### Platform Packages\n\nSome platforms/distros also have Oragono packages maintained for them:\n\n* Arch Linux [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/oragono/) - Maintained by [Sean Enck (@enckse)](https://github.com/enckse).\n\n### Using Docker\n\nA Dockerfile and example docker-compose recipe are available in the `distrib/docker` directory. Oragono is automatically published\nto Docker Hub at [oragono/oragono](https://hub.docker.com/r/oragono/oragono). For more information, see the distrib/docker\n[README file](https://github.com/oragono/oragono/blob/master/distrib/docker/README.md).\n\n### From Source\n\nYou can also install this repo and use that instead! However, keep some things in mind if you go that way:\n\n`devel` branches are intentionally unstable, containing fixes that may not work, and they may be rebased or reworked extensively.\n\nThe `master` branch _should_ usually be stable, but may contain database changes that either have not been finalised or not had database upgrade code written yet. Don't run `master` on a live production network.\n\nThe `stable` branch contains the latest release. You can run this for a production version without any trouble.\n\n#### Building\n\nYou'll need an [up-to-date distribution of the Go language for your OS and architecture](https://golang.org/dl/). You'll also need to set up a [Go workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html). Typically, this is just a directory `~/go`, with the `GOPATH` environment variable exported to its path with `export GOPATH=~/go`.\n\nClone the repository where `go` expects it to be and then run `make`, i.e.,\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/oragono\ncd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/oragono\ngit clone https://github.com/oragono/oragono\ncd oragono\n# check out the appropriate branch if necessary\n# now, this will install a development copy of oragono at ${GOPATH}/bin/oragono:\nmake\n````\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe default config file [`oragono.yaml`](oragono.yaml) helps walk you through what each option means and changes. The configuration's intended to be sparse, so if there are options missing it's either because that feature isn't written/configurable yet or because we don't think it should be configurable.\n\nYou can use the `--conf` parameter when launching Oragono to control where it looks for the config file. For instance: `oragono run --conf /path/to/ircd.yaml`. The configuration file also stores where the log, database, certificate, and other files are opened. Normally, all these files use relative paths, but you can change them to be absolute (such as `/var/log/ircd.log`) when running Oragono as a service.\n\n### Logs\n\nBy default, logs go to stderr only. They can be configured to go to a file, or you can use systemd to direct the stderr to the system journal (see the manual for details). The configuration format of logs is designed to be easily pluggable, and is inspired by the logging config provided by InspIRCd.\n\n### Passwords\n\nPasswords (for both `PASS` and oper logins) are stored using bcrypt. To generate encrypted strings for use in the config, use the `genpasswd` subcommand as such:\n\n```sh\noragono genpasswd\n```\n\nWith this, you receive a blob of text which you can plug into your configuration file.\n\n## Running\n\nAfter this, running the server is easy! Simply run the below command and you should see the relevant startup information pop up.\n\n```sh\noragono run\n```\n\n### How to register a channel\n\n1. Register your account with `/NS REGISTER <username> <email> <password>`\n2. Join the channel with `/join #channel`\n3. Register the channel with `/CS REGISTER #channel`\n\nAfter this, your channel will remember the fact that you're the owner, the topic, and any modes set on it!\n\nMake sure to setup [SASL](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/sasl) in your client to automatically login to your account when you next join the server.\n\n\n# Credits\n\n* Jeremy Latt, creator of Ergonomadic, <https://github.com/jlatt>\n* Edmund Huber, maintainer of Ergonomadic, <https://github.com/edmund-huber>\n* Niels Freier, added WebSocket support to Ergonomadic, <https://github.com/stumpyfr>\n* Daniel Oakley, maintainer of Oragono, <https://github.com/DanielOaks>\n* Euan Kemp, contributor to Oragono and lots of useful fixes, <https://github.com/euank>\n* Shivaram Lingamneni, co-maintainer of Oragono, <https://github.com/slingamn>\n* James Mills, contributed Docker support, <https://github.com/prologic>\n* Vegax, implementing some commands and helping when Oragono was just getting started, <https://github.com/vegax87>\n* Sean Enck, transitioned us from using a custom script to a proper Makefile, <https://github.com/enckse>\n* apologies to anyone I forgot.\n"
