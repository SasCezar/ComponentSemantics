When\nyou write your app for `react-server`, you concentrate on your React components,\nand `react-server` takes care of everything else that\'s needed to run and deploy\nreal React server-rendered apps. Under the hood, `react-server` is doing a bunch\nof clever optimizations, many borrowed from the ideas behind [Facebook\'s Big Pipe](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/bigpipe-pipelining-web-pages-for-high-performance/389414033919/),\nto make sure that your site shows up as quickly as humanly possible\nfor your users.\n\nOnce you\'re hungry for more, dig into [the React Server documentation](https://react-server.io/docs) and\nthe [`react-server`](packages/react-server) code.\n** **\n\n#### Migrating from react-server 0.8.1 to 1.0.0\n\nThis release is a major, potentially breaking, change which upgrades react-server\'s dependencies from webpack 1.x to webpack 4.x, and babel 6.x to babel 7.x.\n\nIf using default react-server configuration, you should be able to update to 1.0.0 without issue. However, if you have extended the default react-server webpack config using the `webpackConfig` option, you may need to update your webpack configuration options to match [Webpack 4.x Documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts).\n\n**Note**: If you are having trouble loading css bundles in `mode = production`, try switching from `import` to `require()` syntax. https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/issues/27\n\n\n#### Want to help?\n\nGreat!
