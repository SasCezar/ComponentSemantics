It doesn\'t need to be limited to applications though, you can add links to anything you like.\n\nHeimdall is an elegant solution to organise all your web applications. It\xe2\x80\x99s dedicated to this purpose so you won\xe2\x80\x99t lose your links in a sea of bookmarks.\n\nWhy not use it as your browser start page? It even has the ability to include a search bar using either Google, Bing or DuckDuckGo.\n\n![Heimdall demo animation](https://i.imgur.com/MrC4QpN.gif)\n\n## Video\nIf you want to see a quick video of it in use, go to https://youtu.be/GXnnMAxPzMc\n\n## Supported applications\nYou can use the app to link to any site or application, but Foundation apps will auto fill in the icon for the app and supply a default color for the tile. In addition Enhanced apps allow you provide details to an apps API, allowing you to view live stats directly on the dashboad. For example, the NZBGet and Sabnzbd Enhanced apps will display the queue size and download speed while something is downloading.\n\nSupported applications are recognized by the title of the application as entered in the title field when adding an application. For example, to add a link to pfSense, begin by typing "p" in the title field and then select "pfSense" from the list of supported applications.\n\n[![enhancedapps](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json.svg?label=Enhanced%20Apps&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.heimdall.site%2Fstats&query=enhanced_apps&colorB=3f8483&style=for-the-badge&logo=data:image/png;base64,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)](https://apps.heimdall.site/applications/enhanced)\n\n[![foundationapps](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json.svg?label=Foundation%20Apps&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.heimdall.site%2Fstats&query=foundation_apps&colorB=3f8483&style=for-the-badge&logo=data:image/png;base64,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)](https://apps.heimdall.site/applications/foundation)\n\n## Installing\nApart from the Laravel dependencies, namely PHP >= 7.1.3, OpenSSL PHP Extension, PDO PHP Extension, Filter PHP Extension, Mbstring PHP Extension, Tokenizer PHP Extension, XML PHP Extension, Ctype PHP Extension and JSON PHP Extension, the only other thing Heimdall needs is sqlite support and zip support (php-zip).\n\nIf you find you can\'t change the background make sure `php_fileinfo` is enabled in your php.ini. I believe it should be by default, but one user came across the issue on a windows system.\n\nInstallation is as simple as cloning the repository somewhere, or downloading and extracting the zip/tar and pointing your httpd document root to the `/public` folder then creating the .env file and generating an encryption key (this is all taken care of for you with the docker). \n\n```\ncd /path/to/heimdall\ncp .env.example .env\nphp artisan key:generate\n```\n\nFor simple testing you could just go to the folder and type `php artisan serve`\n\nThere is also a multi-arch Docker which supports x86-64, armhf and arm64, instructions on how to use them at\n\n- https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/heimdall/\n\n## New background image not being set\nIf you are using the docker image or a default php install you may find images over 2MB wont get set as the background image, you just need to change the `upload_max_filesize` in the php.ini.\n\nIf you are using the linuxserver.io docker image simply edit `/path/to/config/php/php-local.ini` and add `upload_max_filesize = 30M` to the end.\n\n## Docker and enhanced apps\nIf you are running the docker and the EnhancedApps you are using are also in dockers, you may need to use the docker networking addresses to communicate with them.\n\nYou can do this by using `http(s)://docker_name:port` in the config section. Instead of the name you can use the internal docker ip, this usually starts with `172.`\n\n## Languages\nThe app has been translated into several languages; however, the quality of the translations could do with work. If you would like to improve them, or help with other translations, they are stored in `/resources/lang/`.\n\nTo create a new language translation, make a new folder with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code as the name, copy `app.php` from `/resources/lang/en/app.php` into your new folder and replace the English strings.\n\nWhen you are finished, create a pull request.\n\nCurrently added languages are\n\n- English\n- German\n- Finnish\n- French\n- Swedish\n- Spanish\n- Turkish\n\n## Web Server Configuration\n\n### Apache\nA `.htaccess` file ships with the app, however, a lot of apache installations disallow `.htaccess` files by default.\nYou will notice this due to some links not working like `/settings`.\nIn addition mod-rewrite needs to be enabled if it isn\'t already.\n\n#### Fixes & work around options\n##### - Apache global allow .htaccess\nFind the `AllowOverride None` line in your apache configuration and change this to `AllowOverride All`\n\n##### - Apache vhost configuration allow .htaccess\nIn the apache vhost configuration in the `<Directory />` block add `AllowOverride All`\n\n##### - Add .htaccess content in apache configuration\nYou can add the full `.htaccess` into your apache configuration, this way you do not need to allow `.htaccess` files.\nYou can even shorten the content of the `.htaccess` when inserting it into the apache configuration to:\n```\nOptions +FollowSymLinks\nRewriteEngine On\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^ index.php [L]\n```\n#### More info\nMore info about `AllowOverride` can be found here:\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#allowoverride\n\n\n\n### Nginx\nIf you are using Nginx, the following directive in your site configuration will direct all requests to the `index.php` front controller:\n\n```\nlocation / {\n    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;\n}\n```\nSomeone was using the same nginx setup to both run this and reverse proxy Plex, Plex is served from `/web` so their location was interfering with the `/webfonts`.\n\nTherefore, if your fonts aren\'t showing because you have a location for `/web`, add the following\n```\nlocation /webfonts {\n    try_files $uri $uri/;\n}\n```\nIf there are any other locations which might interfere with any of the folders in the `/public` folder, you might have to do the same for those as well, but it\'s a super fringe case.\n\n### Reverse proxy\nIf you\'d like to reverse proxy this app, we recommend using our letsencrypt/nginx docker image: [Letsencrypt/Nginx](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/letsencrypt/)\nYou can either reverse proxy from the root location, or from a subdomain (subfolder method is currently not supported). For HTTPS proxy, make sure you use the HTTPS port of Heimdall webserver, otherwise some links may break. You can add security through `.htpasswd`\n\n```\nlocation / {\n    auth_basic "Restricted";\n    auth_basic_user_file /config/nginx/.htpasswd;\n    include /config/nginx/proxy.conf;\n    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;\n    proxy_pass http://heimdall;\n}\n```\n\n### Self-signed certificates and local CAs\nPer default Heimdall uses the standard certificate bundle file (`ca-certificates.crt`) to verify HTTPS sites and will ignore additional certificates placed in `/etc/ssl/certs`. If you wish to use enhanced apps with HTTPS sites that use a self-signed certificate or certs signed with your own local CA, you can override the default bundle:\n\n- Create a unified certificate `.pem` file that contains all CAs and certificates that Heimdall has to verify. For example, if you use both LetsEncrypt and a local CA for your internal apps, concatenate the LetsEncrypt intermediate CA (export via browser) and your local CA `cert.pem` (or any number of self-signed certs) into one `heimdall.pem` file.\n- Place the `heimdall.pem` into the container (if you use Docker), for example by placing it in the path that you mapped to `/config`. Make sure that the Heimdall user has read access (`chmod a+r`).\n- Set the `openssl.cafile` setting in `/config/php/php-local.ini` to your cert bundle:\n\n```\n# /config/php/php-local.ini\nopenssl.cafile = /config/heimdall.pem\n```\n\nRestart the container and the enhanced apps should now be able to access your local HTTP websites. This configuration will survive updating or recreating the Heimdall container.\n\n## Support\nhttps://discord.gg/CCjHKn4 or through GitHub issues\n\n## Donate\nIf you would like to show your appreciation, feel free to use the link below.\n\n[![PayPal](https://heimdall.site/img/paypaldonate.svg)](https://www.paypal.me/heimdall)\n\n## Credits\n- PHP Framework - [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)\n- Icons - [FontAwesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/)\n- JavaScript - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)\n- Colour picker - [Huebee](http://huebee.buzz/)\n- Background image - [pexels](https://www.pexels.com)\n- Everyone at Linuxserver.io that has helped with the app and let\'s not forget IronicBadger for the following question that started it all:\n```\nyou know, i would love something like this landing page for all my servers apps\nthat gives me the ability to pin favourites\nand / or search\n@Stark @Kode do either of you think you\'d be able to rustle something like this up ?\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis app is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n'
