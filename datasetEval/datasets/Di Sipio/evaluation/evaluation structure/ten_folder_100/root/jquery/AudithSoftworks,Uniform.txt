b'# (jQuery) Uniform\n\n> A jQuery plugin to make your form controls look how you want them to. Now with HTML-5 attributes!\n\nWorks well with jQuery 1.6+, but we\'ve received patches and heard that this works with jQuery 1.3.\n\nVersion 4.3.x uses jQuery 3.3.1+ and so far, things look promising.\n\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@imanov/jquery.uniform.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=plastic)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@imanov/jquery.uniform)\n[![Total Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/AudithSoftworks/Uniform/total.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=plastic)](https://github.com/AudithSoftworks/Uniform)\n[![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/AudithSoftworks/Uniform.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=plastic)](https://github.com/AudithSoftworks/Uniform)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/AudithSoftworks/Uniform.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=plastic)](https://github.com/AudithSoftworks/Uniform/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n\n## Installation\n\nPackaging of Uniform comes with source SASS files and minified CSS files, ready for consumption in live/production environment. You can install Uniform via one of two methods listed below:\n\n### Via NPM\n\n[![NPM Monthly Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/jquery.uniform.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery.uniform)\n[![NPM Total Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/jquery.uniform.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery.uniform)\n\nSimply run:\n\n    npm install --save @imanov/jquery.uniform\n    \nTo create minified file, run (though this isn\'t necessary, as the minified file is already included in the package):\n    \n    npm run build\n    \nMinified source file will be built inside ```dist/``` folder.\n\n### Via Public CDN\n\n[![CDNJS](https://img.shields.io/cdnjs/v/Uniform.js.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=plastic)](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Uniform.js)\n[![jsDelivr Hits](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/jquery.uniform/badge?style=rounded)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/jquery.uniform)\n\n### Un-minified CSS files\n\nFor your own development purposes, to get human-readable, un-minified CSS outputs, you will need to install Uniform via NPM (as shown above), install the necessary dependencies through ```npm install``` and then run ```gulp```. Doing so will recreate readable CSS files in ```dist/css``` folder. Invoking ```gulp --production``` however, will recreate minified CSS files (which is default behavior, what we already have in the ```dist``` folder).\n    \n\n## Implementation\n\nThere are two ways to go with this:\n\n### Basic Implementation\n\nBasically, you can use the final assets provided in ```dist``` folder out of the box.\n \nStylesheets and Javascript files should be linked in the ```<header>``` of your markup (the latter, coming after jQuery):\n\n    <!-- Make sure your CSS file is listed before Javascript sources -->\n\t<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path-to-my-assets/uniform/dist/css/default.css" media="screen">\n\t<script src="/path-to-my-assets/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>\n\t<script src="/path-to-my-assets/uniform/dist/js/jquery.uniform.standalone.js"></script>\n\nOr if you are using our bundled version - ```jquery.uniform.bundled.js``` file - which already comes with jQuery (beware not to include jQuery twice):\n\n    <!-- Make sure your CSS file is listed before Javascript sources -->\n\t<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path-to-my-assets/uniform/dist/css/default.css" media="screen">\n\t<script src="/path-to-my-assets/uniform/dist/js/jquery.uniform.bundled.js"></script>\n\n### Advanced Implementation\n\nTo have more control over your web assets, you can directly work with our SCSS and JS files, by importing them into or bundling with your own assets. Please be advised that our Gulp configuration (via Laravel-Elixir package) includes Auto-prefixer, i.e. browser prefixes are automatically added to CSS during the post-processing of SCSS files. Whatever your post-processing solution will be (Gulp-based or Compass), you need to make sure to include Auto-prefixer in that workflow. Our SCSS source files do not include browser prefixes out of the box! \n\n\n## Usage\n\nSee our <a href="https://github.com/AudithSoftworks/Uniform/wiki">Wiki page</a> for documentation.\n\n\n## Reporting Bugs\n\nIt sure would be handy if you could create a test page to help illustrate bugs.  When you use the <a href="https://github.com/AudithSoftworks/Uniform/issues">GitHub Issue Tracker</a>, you could use [this jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/Shehi/qgLwy8Ln/) to help illustrate your point. Additionally, we have provided some demo pages in ```/demo``` folder for you to use.\n\nEven if you don\'t use these assets, all sorts of feedback is welcome, but narrowing down your problem or providing an example would immediately help narrow down the problem quickly.\n\n## Contributor/Developer Assets\n\nWe have created a Docker container to help our contributors with development of Uniform.\n\n[![](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/audithsoftworks/uniform.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/audithsoftworks/uniform "Docker Hub public images")\n[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/audithsoftworks/uniform.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/audithsoftworks/uniform "Docker Hub public images")\n[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/audithsoftworks/uniform.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/audithsoftworks/uniform "Docker Hub public images layers")\n[![](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/audithsoftworks/uniform.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/audithsoftworks/uniform "Docker Hub public images")\n\nAdditionally, ```/dev``` folder contains following assets, to further enhance our capabilities:\n\n1. ```docker``` folder contains necessary ```Dockerfile``` to build the container.\n2. ```theme-kit``` contains assets to help you create new themes.\n3. ```build.sh``` script, which basically spins a Docker container up and builds the package, using that instance.\n'
