b'# <img src="https://leafpub.org/content/uploads/2016/11/leafpub-logo-1.png" alt="Leafpub" width="300">\n**Simple, beautiful publishing.**\n\n### [Website](https://leafpub.org/) &nbsp; [Documentation](https://leafpub.org/docs) &nbsp;\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Leafpub/leafpub)  &nbsp; [![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/leafpub.svg?style=social&maxAge=3600)](https://twitter.com/leafpub)\n\nCreated by [Cory LaViska](https://twitter.com/claviska)\n\nMaintained by [Marc Apfelbaum](https://twitter.com/karsasmus)\n\n![Screenshots](https://leafpub.org/content/uploads/2016/07/homepage-splash.png)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- PHP 7.1+ with curl, gd lib, mbstring, openssl & pdo\n- MySQL 5.5.3+\n\n## Download\n\n**This is the development repo!** You\'ll need to build Leafpub using the instructions below before running it.\n\nDownload the latest ready-to-use version from: https://leafpub.org/download\n\n## Contributing\n\nLeafpub uses Composer and NPM to manage dependencies and Gulp as its task runner. To contribute to this project, you\'ll need to clone the repository and install the required development tools listed below.\n\n- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)\n- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (Install using `npm install -g gulp-cli`)\n\nPlease read through our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/leafpub/leafpub/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n> Something is wrong with a translation? Your language isn\'t available? Please read through the [language section](https://github.com/leafpub/leafpub/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#languages)\n\n## Building\n\nOnce you have the necessary development tools installed:\n\n1. Open a terminal\n2. Navigate to the root directory of your cloned repo\n3. Run the following command:\n\n```\ncomposer install\n```\n\nComposer will install its own dependencies and then run `npm install`. This may take a few minutes as packages are downloaded. Once complete, Composer will trigger `gulp build` which will generate all the assets you need to run Leafpub.\n\n**Important:** You\'ll also need to add [the default theme](https://github.com/Leafpub/range) to `content/themes/range/` manually. This will happen automatically once Leafpub is out of beta.\n\n## Using Gulp\n\nFrom the root directory, you can use `gulp help` to see all available tasks:\n\n```\nUsage\n    gulp [TASK] [OPTIONS...]\n\nAvailable tasks\n    build          Run all build tasks. [build:fonts, build:images, build:prune, build:scripts, build:styles]\n    build:fonts    Build font assets. [clean:fonts]\n    build:images   Optimize images. [clean:images]\n    build:prune    Prune unused files from vendor packages.\n    build:scripts  Build scripts. [jshint, clean:scripts]\n    build:styles   Build styles. [clean:styles]\n    clean          Clean up generated files. [clean:fonts, clean:images, clean:scripts, clean:styles]\n    clean:fonts    Delete generated fonts.\n    clean:images   Delete generated images.\n    clean:scripts  Delete generated scripts.\n    clean:styles   Delete generated styles.\n    default        Run the default task. [watch]\n    help           Display this help text.\n    jshint         Lint source scripts with JSHint.\n    release:clean  Delete all generated releases.\n    release:make   Generate a release.\n    watch          Watch for script and style changes.\n```\n\nFor development, use `gulp watch` to automatically compile Sass/JavaScript as you work.\n\n## Testing\n\nYou can run Leafpub on PHP\'s built in web server using the following command:\n\n```\nphp -S localhost:8080 -t app\n```\n\nThen open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.\n\n**Note:** You might need to use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` in your database config!\n\n## Versioning\n\nLeafpub is maintained under the [Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/) and we adhere to them as closely as possible.\n\n## Developers\n\n**Marc Apfelbaum**\n\n- https://twitter.com/karsasmus\n- http://github.com/karsasmus\n\n## License\n\n\xc2\xa92018 Marc\n\nThis software is copyrighted.
