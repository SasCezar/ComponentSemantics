b'A simple & lightweight method of displaying modal windows with jQuery.\n\nFor quick examples and demos, head to [jquerymodal.com](http://jquerymodal.com/).\n\n# Why another modal plugin?\n\nMost plugins I\'ve found try to do too much, and have specialized ways of handling photo galleries, iframes and video.  The resulting HTML & CSS is often bloated and difficult to customize.\n\nBy contrast, this plugin handles the two most common scenarios I run into\n\n* displaying an existing DOM element\n* loading a page with AJAX\n\nand does so with as little HTML & CSS as possible.\n\n# Installation\n\nYou can install [jquery-modal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-modal) with npm:\n\n`npm install jquery-modal`\n\nor with [Bower](http://bower.io/):\n\n`bower install jquery-modal`\n\nor use the hosted version from [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery-modal):\n\n```html\n<!-- Remember to include jQuery :) -->\n<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>\n\n<!-- jQuery Modal -->\n<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-modal/0.9.1/jquery.modal.min.js"></script>\n<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-modal/0.9.1/jquery.modal.min.css" />\n```\n\n**Using Rails?** Check out the [jquery-modal-rails plugin](https://github.com/dei79/jquery-modal-rails)!\n\n**jQuery Requirements:** As of version 0.3.0, jQuery 1.7 is required. If you\'re using an earlier version of jQuery you can use the [v.0.2.5 tag.](https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-modal/tags)\n\n**Naming conflict with Bootstrap:** Bootstrap\'s [modal](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals) uses the same `$.modal` namespace. If you want to use jquery-modal with Bootstrap, the simplest solution is to manually modify the name of this plugin.\n\n# Opening\n\n#### Method 1: Automatically attaching to links\n\nThe simplest approach is to add `rel="modal:open"` to your links and use the `href` attribute to specify what to open in the modal.\n\nOpen an existing DOM element by ID:\n\n```html\n<form id="login-form" class="modal">\n  ...\n</form>\n\n<a href="#login-form" rel="modal:open">Login</a>\n```\n\nLoad a remote URL with AJAX:\n\n```html\n<a href="login.html" rel="modal:open">Login</a>\n```\n\n#### Method 2: Manually\n\nYou can manually open a modal by calling the `.modal()` method on the element:\n\n```html\n<form id="login-form" class="modal">\n  ...\n</form>\n```\n\n```js\n$(\'#login-form\').modal();\n```\n\nYou can also invoke `.modal()` directly on links:\n\n```html\n<a href="#ex5" data-modal>Open a DOM element</a>\n<a href="ajax.html" data-modal>Open an AJAX modal</a>\n```\n\n```js\n$(\'a[data-modal]\').click(function(event) {\n  $(this).modal();\n  return false;\n});\n```\n\n### Compatibility Fallback\n\nYou can provide a clean fallback for users who have JavaScript disabled by manually attaching the modal via the `data-modal` attribute. This allows you to write your links pointing to the `href` as normal (fallback) while enabling modals where JavaScript is enabled.\n\n```html\n<!-- By default link takes user to /login.html -->\n<a href="/login.html" data-modal="#login-modal">Login</a>\n\n<!-- Login modal embedded in page -->\n<div id="login-modal" class="modal">\n  ...\n</div>\n\n<!-- For browsers with JavaScript, open the modal. -->\n<script>\n  $(function() {\n    $(\'a[data-modal]\').on(\'click\', function() {\n      $($(this).data(\'modal\')).modal();\n      return false;\n    });\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\n#### Fade Transitions\n\nBy default the overlay & window appear instantaneously, but you can enable a fade effect by specifying the `fadeDuration` option.\n\n```js\n$(\'a.open-modal\').click(function(event) {\n  $(this).modal({\n    fadeDuration: 250\n  });\n  return false;\n});\n```\n\nThis will fade in the overlay and modal over 250 milliseconds _simultaneously._ If you want the effect of the overlay appearing _before_ the window, you can specify the `fadeDelay` option. This indicates at what point during the overlay transition the window transition should begin.\n\nSo if you wanted the window to fade in when the overlay\'s was 80% finished:\n\n```js\n$(elm).modal({\n  fadeDuration: 250,\n  fadeDelay: 0.80\n});\n```\n\nOr, if you wanted the window to fade in a few moments after the overlay transition has completely finished:\n\n```js\n$(elm).modal({\n  fadeDuration: 250,\n  fadeDelay: 1.5\n});\n```\n\nThe `fadeDelay` option only applies when opening the modal. When closing the modal, both the modal and the overlay fade out simultaneously according to the `fadeDuration` setting.\n\nFading is the only supported transition.\n\n# Closing\n\nBecause there can be only one modal active at a single time, there\'s no need to select which modal to close:\n\n```js\n$.modal.close();\n```\n\nSimilar to how links can be automatically bound to open modals, they can be bound to close modals using `rel="modal:close"`:\n\n```html\n<a href="#close" rel="modal:close">Close window</a>\n```\n\n_(Note that modals loaded with AJAX are removed from the DOM when closed)._\n\n# Checking current state\n\n* Use `$.modal.isActive()` to check if a modal is currently being displayed.\n* Use `$.modal.getCurrent()` to retrieve a reference to the currently active modal instance, if any.\n\n# Options\n\nThese are the supported options and their default values:\n\n```js\n$.modal.defaults = {\n  closeExisting: true,    // Close existing modals. Set this to false if you need to stack multiple modal instances.\n  escapeClose: true,      // Allows the user to close the modal by pressing `ESC`\n  clickClose: true,       // Allows the user to close the modal by clicking the overlay\n  closeText: \'Close\',     // Text content for the close <a> tag.\n  closeClass: \'\',         // Add additional class(es) to the close <a> tag.\n  showClose: true,        // Shows a (X) icon/link in the top-right corner\n  modalClass: "modal",    // CSS class added to the element being displayed in the modal.\n  blockerClass: "modal",  // CSS class added to the overlay (blocker).\n\n  // HTML appended to the default spinner during AJAX requests.\n  spinnerHtml: \'<div class="rect1"></div><div class="rect2"></div><div class="rect3"></div><div class="rect4"></div>\',\n\n  showSpinner: true,      // Enable/disable the default spinner during AJAX requests.\n  fadeDuration: null,     // Number of milliseconds the fade transition takes (null means no transition)\n  fadeDelay: 1.0          // Point during the overlay\'s fade-in that the modal begins to fade in (.5 = 50%, 1.5 = 150%, etc.)\n};\n```\n\n# Events\n\nThe following events are triggered on the modal element at various points in the open/close cycle (see below for AJAX events).\n\n```javascript\n$.modal.BEFORE_BLOCK = \'modal:before-block\';    // Fires just before the overlay (blocker) appears.\n$.modal.BLOCK = \'modal:block\';                  // Fires after the overlay (block) is visible.\n$.modal.BEFORE_OPEN = \'modal:before-open\';      // Fires just before the modal opens.\n$.modal.OPEN = \'modal:open\';                    // Fires after the modal has finished opening.\n$.modal.BEFORE_CLOSE = \'modal:before-close\';    // Fires when the modal has been requested to close.\n$.modal.CLOSE = \'modal:close\';                  // Fires when the modal begins closing (including animations).\n$.modal.AFTER_CLOSE = \'modal:after-close\';      // Fires after the modal has fully closed (including animations).\n```\n\nThe first and only argument passed to these event handlers is the `modal` object, which has four properties:\n\n```js\nmodal.$elm;       // Original jQuery object upon which modal() was invoked.\nmodal.options;    // Options passed to the modal.\nmodal.$blocker;   // The overlay element.\nmodal.$anchor;    // Anchor element originating the event.\n```\n\nSo, you could do something like this:\n\n```js\n$(\'#purchase-form\').on($.modal.BEFORE_CLOSE, function(event, modal) {\n  clear_shopping_cart();\n});\n```\n\n# AJAX\n\n## Basic support\n\njQuery Modal uses $.get for basic AJAX support. A simple spinner will be displayed by default (if you\'ve included modal.css) and will have the class `modal-spinner`. If you\'ve set the `modalClass` option, the spinner will be prefixed with that class name instead.\n\nYou can add text or additional HTML to the spinner with the `spinnerHtml` option, or disable the spinner entirely by setting `showSpinner: false`.\n\nThe default spinner is from the excellent [SpinKit](http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/) by [Tobias Ahlin](https://twitter.com/tobiasahlin) \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\n\n## Events\n\nThe following events are triggered when AJAX modals are requested.\n\n```js\n$.modal.AJAX_SEND = \'modal:ajax:send\';\n$.modal.AJAX_SUCCESS = \'modal:ajax:success\';\n$.modal.AJAX_FAIL = \'modal:ajax:fail\';\n$.modal.AJAX_COMPLETE = \'modal:ajax:complete\';\n```\n\nThe handlers receive no arguments. The events are triggered on the `<a>` element which initiated the AJAX modal.\n\n## More advanced AJAX handling\n\nIt\'s a good idea to provide more robust AJAX handling -- error handling, in particular. Instead of accommodating the myriad [`$.ajax` options](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) jQuery provides, jquery-modal makes it possible to directly modify the AJAX request itself.\n\nSimply bypass the default AJAX handling (i.e.: don\'t use `rel="modal"`)\n\n```html\n<a href="ajax.html" rel="ajax:modal">Click me!</a>\n```\n\nand make your AJAX request in the link\'s click handler. Note that you need to manually append the new HTML/modal in the `success` callback:\n\n```js\n$(\'a[rel="ajax:modal"]\').click(function(event) {\n\n  $.ajax({\n\n    url: $(this).attr(\'href\'),\n\n    success: function(newHTML, textStatus, jqXHR) {\n      $(newHTML).appendTo(\'body\').modal();\n    },\n\n    error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {\n      // Handle AJAX errors\n    }\n\n    // More AJAX customization goes here.\n\n  });\n\n  return false;\n});\n```\n\nNote that the AJAX response must be wrapped in a div with class <code>modal</code> when using the second (manual) method.\n\n# Bugs & Feature Requests\n\n### Found a bug? MEH!\n\n![](http://drops.kylefox.ca/1cqGP+)\n\n**Just kidding.** Please [create an issue](https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-modal/issues/new) and **include a publicly-accessible demonstration of the bug.** [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) or [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) work well for demonstrating reproducable bugs, but you can use anything as long as it\'s publicly accessible. Your issue is much more likely to be resolved/merged if it includes a fix & pull request.\n\n**Have an idea that improves jquery-modal?** Awesome! Please fork this repository, implement your idea (including documentation, if necessary), and submit a pull request.\n\nI don\'t use this library as frequently as I used to, so if you want to see a fix/improvement you\'re best off submitting a pull request. Bugs without a test case and/or improvements without a pull request will be shown no mercy and closed!\n\n# Contributing\n\n## Maintainers Wanted\n\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintainers-wanted-red.svg)\n\nThis library became more popular and active than I ever expected, and unfortunately I don\'t have time to maintain it myself.\n\nIf you are interested in helping me maintain this library, please let me know \xe2\x80\x94 **I would love your help!**\n\n[**Read more about becoming a maintainer &raquo;**](https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-modal/issues/170)\n\n_I\'d especially like people who would be excited about working towards a brand new **jQuery Modal 2.0**. See my [Proposal for jQuery Modal 2.0](https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-modal/issues/169) for more details & discussion._\n\n## How to contribute\n\nI welcome improvements to this plugin, particularly with:\n\n* Performance improvements\n* Making the code as concise/efficient as possible\n* Bug fixes & browser compatibility\n\nPlease fork and send pull requests, or create an [issue](https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-modal/issues). Keep in mind the spirit of this plugin is **minimalism** so I\'m very picky about adding _new_ features.\n\n## Tips for development/contributing\n\n* Make sure dependencies are installed: `npm install`\n* After modifying `jquery.modal.js` and/or `jquery.modal.css`, you can optionally regenerate the minified files with `gulp min` and `gulp css` respectively.\n* Make sure you have updated documentation (`README.md` and/or `examples/index.html`) if necessary. **Pull requests without documentation updates will be rejected.**\n* Maintainers should increment version numbers and run `gulp changelog` when cutting a new release.\n\n# Support\n\nPlease post a question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).
