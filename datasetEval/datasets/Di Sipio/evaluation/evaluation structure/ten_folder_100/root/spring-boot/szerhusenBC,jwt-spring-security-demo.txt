b'# JWT Spring Security Demo\n\n![Screenshot from running application](etc/screenshot-jwt-spring-security-demo.png?raw=true "Screenshot JWT Spring Security Demo")\n\n## About\nThis is a demo for using **[JWT (JSON Web Token)](https://jwt.io)** with **[Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)** and\n**[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)**. I completely rewrote my first version. Now this solution is based on the code base\nfrom the [JHipster Project](https://www.jhipster.tech/). I tried to extract the minimal configuration and classes that are needed \nfor JWT-Authentication and did some changes.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/szerhusenBC/jwt-spring-security-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/szerhusenBC/jwt-spring-security-demo)\n\n## Requirements\nThis demo is build with with Maven 3.6.x and Java 11.\n\n## Usage\nJust start the application with the Spring Boot maven plugin (`mvn spring-boot:run`). The application is\nrunning at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).\n\nYou can use the **H2-Console** for exploring the database under [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console):\n\n![Screenshot from h2-console login](etc/screenshot-h2-console-login.png?raw=true "Screenshot H2-Console login")\n\n## Backend\nThere are three user accounts present to demonstrate the different levels of access to the endpoints in\nthe API and the different authorization exceptions:\n```\nAdmin - admin:admin\nUser - user:password\nDisabled - disabled:password (this user is deactivated)\n```\n\nThere are four endpoints that are reasonable for the demo:\n```\n/api/authenticate - authentication endpoint with unrestricted access\n/api/user - returns detail information for an authenticated user (a valid JWT token must be present in the request header)\n/api/persons - an example endpoint that is restricted to authorized users with the authority \'ROLE_USER\' (a valid JWT token must be present in the request header)\n/api/hiddenmessage - an example endpoint that is restricted to authorized users with the authority \'ROLE_ADMIN\' (a valid JWT token must be present in the request header)\n```\n\n## Frontend\nI\'ve written a small Javascript client and put some comments in the code that hopefully makes this demo understandable.\nYou can find it at [/src/main/resources/static/js/client.js](/src/main/resources/static/js/client.js).\n\n### Generating password hashes for new users\n\nI\'m using [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) to encode passwords. Your can generate your hashes with this simple \ntool: [Bcrypt Generator](https://www.bcrypt-generator.com)\n\n### Using another database\n\nActually this demo is using an embedded H2 database that is automatically configured by Spring Boot. If you want to connect \nto another database you have to specify the connection in the *application.yml* in the resource directory. Here is an example for a MySQL DB:\n\n```\nspring:\n  jpa:\n    hibernate:\n      # possible values: validate | update | create | create-drop\n      ddl-auto: create-drop\n  datasource:\n    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost/myDatabase\n    username: myUser\n    password: myPassword\n    driver-class-name: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\n```\n\n*Hint: For other databases like MySQL sequences don\'t work for ID generation. So you have to change the GenerationType in the entity beans to \'AUTO\' or \'IDENTITY\'.*\n\nYou can find a reference of all application properties [here](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html).\n\n### Using Flyway\n\nhttps://github.com/szerhusenBC/jwt-spring-security-demo/issues/81\n\n## Docker\nThis project has a docker image.
