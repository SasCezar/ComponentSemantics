b'LocaleChanger\n=================\nAn Android library to programmatically set the Locale of an app and persist the configuration. \n\nDownload\n--------\nStep 1. Add the JitPack repository in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:\n```groovy\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        ...\n        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }\n    }\n}\n```\nStep 2. Add the dependency\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n        compile \'com.github.franmontiel:LocaleChanger:0.9.2\'\n}\n```\nUsage\n-----\n### Basic usage\nInitialize the library from your `Application` class with a list of your app supported Locales:\n```java\nLocaleChanger.initialize(getApplicationContext(), SUPPORTED_LOCALES);\n```\nThe first time that is invoked it will automatically set a Locale taking into account the system configuration. The first element of the supported Locale list will be used as default if no match with the system configured Locales is found.\n\nYou also need to call `onConfigurationChange` from the same named method in your `Application` class:\n```java\n@Override\npublic void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) {\n    super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);\n    LocaleChanger.onConfigurationChanged();\n}\n```\nAnd create a new Locale configured `Context` for all your `Activities` calling `configureBaseContext`:\n```java\n@Override\nprotected void attachBaseContext(Context newBase) {\n    newBase = LocaleChanger.configureBaseContext(newBase);\n    super.attachBaseContext(newBase);\n}\n```\nTo change the Locale just make the following call:\n```java\nLocaleChanger.setLocale(newLocale);\n``` \n### Activity recreation \nYou need to recreate the `Activities` once the Locale is changed to reload your resources. You can do it by simply calling the `replace` method of the Activity.\n\nAdditionally there is a `ActivityRecreationHelper` class that is intended for assisting you with the recreation of the Activity.\n \nIt can be used to detect when the Locale has changed and reload automatically the Activity when resumed, for that you must call to the `onResume` and `onDestroy` methods of the helper class from the Activity methods.\n\nIn concrete terms:\n* On the Activity in which you change the language you need to recreate it calling `ActivityRecreationHelper.recreate`.\n* For having the rest of the Activities on the Back Stack recreated automatically when resumed, call `ActivityRecreationHelper.onResume` and `ActivityRecreationHelper.onDestroy` on all your Activities `onResume` and `onDestroy` methods respectively.\n\n\n### Advanced usage\nThe default behavior of the library can be changed providing a `MatchingAlgorithm` and a `LocalePreference`\n* The `MatchingAlgorithm` is used when the library is initialized and when the Locale is changed to find a match between your supported Locales and the system Locales. One of those matching Locales will be set by the library. There are two classes that implements this interface:\n  * `LanguageMatchingAlgorithm` will match the first two Locales with the same language. This is the default algorithm used if no one is defined.\n  * `ClosestMatchingAlgorithm` will match the two Locales with most attributes in common (language, country and variation).\n\n* The `LocalePreference` is used to select witch one of the two matching Locales will be set. The default behavior is to prefer a supported locales if no preference is provided.\n\nKnown issues\n-------\n* The ActionBar title is not affected by the Locale change if it is defined in the Manifest label attribute. A valid workaround is to set the title programmatically.
