b"# Pontoon &mdash; Mozilla's Localization Platform\n\nPontoon is a translation management system used and developed by the\n[Mozilla localization community](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/). It\nspecializes in open source localization that is driven by the community and\nuses version-control systems for storing translations.\n\nCheck out our documentation to learn how to:\n\n* [Localize with Pontoon](https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/localizer-documentation/tools/pontoon/)\n* [Make your projects localizable with Pontoon](https://mozilla-pontoon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/localizing-your-projects.html)\n\n## Installation\n\nOur [installation documentation](https://mozilla-pontoon.readthedocs.io/) is available on `Read the Docs`:\n\n* For local development, see [developer setup](http://mozilla-pontoon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/setup.html) using `Docker`\n* For production installation, see [deployment documentation](http://mozilla-pontoon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/deployment.html)\n* For quick and easy deployment on the `Heroku` platform, click this button:\n\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\n\n## Contributing\n\nDo you want to help us make Pontoon better? We are very glad!\n\nStart by [installing Pontoon locally using Docker](https://mozilla-pontoon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/setup.html). Once you have a working local environment, take a look at our [mentored bugs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev/GetInvolved/pontoon.mozilla.org). It is often better to start with those bugs, as they tend to be easier, and someone is committed to helping you get it done. To start working on a bug, verify that it isn't already assigned to someone else, and then ask on the bug for it to be assigned to you.\n\nBefore you start writing code, make sure to read our [contribution docs](https://mozilla-pontoon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/contributing.html). It contains information on how to style code, how to run tests, how to name your commits, etc. All the things you need to know if you want your work to be merged into Pontoon!\n\nPontoon developers hang around in the `#pontoon` channel on [Mozilla's IRC server](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC).
