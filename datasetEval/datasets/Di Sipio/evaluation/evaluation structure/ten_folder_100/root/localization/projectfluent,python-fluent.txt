b"Project Fluent [![Build Status][travisimage]][travislink]\n=========================================================\n\n[travisimage]: https://travis-ci.org/projectfluent/python-fluent.svg?branch=master\n[travislink]: https://travis-ci.org/projectfluent/python-fluent\n\nThis is a Python implementation of Project Fluent, a localization framework\ndesigned to unleash the entire expressive power of natural language\ntranslations.\n\nProject Fluent keeps simple things simple and makes complex things possible.\nThe syntax used for describing translations is easy to read and understand.  At\nthe same time it allows, when necessary, to represent complex concepts from\nnatural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations, and others.\n\n\nLearn the FTL syntax\n--------------------\n\nFTL is a localization file format used for describing translation resources.\nFTL stands for _Fluent Translation List_.\n\nFTL is designed to be simple to read, but at the same time allows to represent\ncomplex concepts from natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations, and\nothers.\n\n    hello-user = Hello, { $username }!\n\n[Read the Fluent Syntax Guide][] in order to learn more about the syntax.  If\nyou're a tool author you may be interested in the formal [EBNF grammar][].\n\n[Read the Fluent Syntax Guide]: http://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/\n[EBNF grammar]: https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent/tree/master/spec\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\npython-fluent consists of these packages:\n\n* `fluent.syntax` - includes AST classes and parser. Most end users will not\n  need this directly. Documentation coming soon!\n\n  To install:\n\n        pip install fluent.syntax\n\n\n* `fluent.runtime` - methods for generating translations from FTL files.\n\n  To install:\n\n        pip install fluent.runtime\n\n  (The correct version of ``fluent.syntax`` will be installed automatically)\n\n* `fluent.pygments` - a plugin for pygments to add syntax highlighting to Sphinx.\n\n    To install:\n\n        pip install fluent.pygments\n\nPyPI also contains an old `fluent` package which is an older version of just\n`fluent.syntax`.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor fluent.runtime, see the [docs folder](fluent.runtime/docs) or [read them on\nreadthedocs.org](https://fluent-runtime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nDiscuss\n-------\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on Project Fluent!  Whether you're a localizer\nlooking for a better way to express yourself in your language, or a developer\ntrying to make your app localizable and multilingual, or a hacker looking for\na project to contribute to, please do get in touch on the mailing list and the\nIRC channel.\n\n - mailing list: https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/tools-l10n\n - IRC channel: [irc://irc.mozilla.org/l20n](irc://irc.mozilla.org/l20n)\n\n\nGet Involved\n------------\n\npython-fluent is open-source, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\nWe encourage everyone to take a look at our code and we'll listen to your\nfeedback.\n"
