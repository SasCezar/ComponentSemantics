b'# R-VIO\n\nR-VIO is an efficient, lightweight, **robocentric visual-inertial odometry** algorithm for consistent 3D motion tracking using only a monocular camera and a 6-axis IMU. Different from standard world-centric VINS algorithms which directly estimate absolute motion of the sensing platform with respect to a fixed, gravity-aligned, global frame of reference, R-VIO estimates the relative motion of higher accuracy with respect to a moving, local frame (for example, IMU frame) and updates global pose (orientation and position) estimate through composition. This code is developed with the robocentric sliding-window filtering-based VIO framework that was originally proposed in our *IROS2018* paper and further extended in our recent *IJRR* paper:\n\n- Zheng Huai and Guoquan Huang, **Robocentric visual-inertial odometry**, *The International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)*, July 2019: [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364919853361).\n\n- Zheng Huai and Guoquan Huang, **Robocentric visual-inertial odometry**, *IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)*, Madrid, Spain, Oct 1-5, 2018: [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8593643).\n\nVideo (on **EuRoC** and our handheld datasets): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtiZ0EKa55M.\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/RMecOYlfxEcy4T8JdS/giphy.gif)\n\nVideo (on our 9.8km **urban driving** dataset): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9IC2ddBEYQ.\n![](rvio.gif)\n\n## 1. Prerequisites\n\nWe have tested the code under Ubuntu **16.04** and ROS **Kinetic**.\n\n### ROS\nDownload and install instructions can be found at: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu.\n\nAdditional ROS packages needed: tf, sensor_msgs, geometry_msgs, nav_msgs, cv_bridge, eigen_conversions.\n\n### Eigen\nDownload and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.\n\n### OpenCV\nDownload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 2.4.3**. **Tested with 2.4.11 and 3.3.1**.\n\n## 2. Build and Run\nFirst, `git clone` the repository and `catkin_make` it. Then, to run `rvio` with single camera/IMU inputs from the ROS topics `/camera/image_raw` and `/imu`, a config file in *config* folder and the corresponding launch file in *launch* folder (for example, `rvio_euroc.yaml` and `euroc.launch` are for [EuRoC](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) dataset) are needed, and to visualize the outputs of R-VIO please use `rviz` with the settings file `rvio_rviz.rviz` in *config* folder.\n  ```\n  Terminal 1: roscore\n  ```\n  ```\n  Terminal 2: rviz (AND OPEN rvio_rviz.rviz IN THE CONFIG FOLDER)\n  ```\n  ```\n  Terminal 3: roslaunch rvio euroc.launch\n  ```\n  ```\n  Terminal 4: rosbag play --pause V1_01_easy.bag /cam0/image_raw:=/camera/image_raw /imu0:=/imu\n  ```\nYou can also run R-VIO with your own sensor (data) by creating a config file `rvio_NAME_OF_YOUR_DATA.yaml` in *config* folder and the corresponding launch file `NAME_OF_YOUR_DATA.launch` in *launch* folder referring to the above EuRoC example.\n\n## 3.
