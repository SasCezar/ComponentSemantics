There is no easy way to know what strings are missing or to compare them across languages. \n\n## What does this tool do?\n\nStart the Localization Editor, choose File | Open folder with localization files and point it to the folder where your localization files are stored. The tool finds all the `Localizable.strings`, detects their language and displays your strings side by side as shown on the screenshot above. You can point it to the root of your project but it will take longer to process. \n\nAll the translations are sorted by their key (shown as first column) and you can see and compare them quickly, you can also see missing translations in any language. \n\nWhen you change any of the translations the corresponding `Localizable.strings` gets updated.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Homebrew\n\n```bash\nbrew cask install localizationeditor\n```\n\n### Manual\n\nTo download and run the app\n\n- Go to [Releases](https://github.com/igorkulman/iOSLocalizationEditor/releases) and download the built app archive **LocalizationEditor.app.zip** from the latest release\n- Unzip **LocalizationEditor.app.zip**\n- Right click on the extracted **LocalizationEditor.app** and choose Open (just a double-clicking will show a warning because the app is only signed with a development certificate)\n\n## Contributing\n\nAll contributions are welcomed, including bug reports and pull requests with new features.

If you want to add localization for your language, just translate the [Localizable.strings](https://github.com/igorkulman/iOSLocalizationEditor/blob/master/sources/LocalizationEditor/Resources/en.lproj/Localizable.strings) files. You can use this app do do it!\n\n## Author\n\n- **Igor Kulman** - *Initial work* - igor@kulman.sk\n\nSee also the list of [contributors](https://github.com/igorkulman/iOSLocalizationEditor/contributors) who participated in this project.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n'
