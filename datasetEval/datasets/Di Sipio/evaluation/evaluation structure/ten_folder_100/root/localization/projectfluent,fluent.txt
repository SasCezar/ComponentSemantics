b'# Fluent\n\nFluent is a localization system designed to unleash the expressive power of\nthe natural language.\n\nThis repository contains the specification, the reference implementation of the\nparser and the documentation for Fluent.\n\n## Fluent Syntax (FTL)\n\nFTL is the syntax for describing translation resources in Project Fluent.  FTL\nstands for *Fluent Translation List*. Read the [Fluent Syntax Guide][] to get\nstarted learning Fluent.\n\nThe `syntax/` directory contains the reference implementation of the syntax as\na _LL(infinity)_ parser.\n\nThe `spec/` directory contains the formal EBNF grammar, autogenerated from the\nreference implementation.\n\n## Development\n\nWhile working on the reference parser, use the following commands to test and\nvalidate your work:\n\n    npm test                   # Test the parser against JSON AST fixtures.\n    npm run lint               # Lint the parser code.\n\n    npm run generate:ebnf      # Generate the EBNF from syntax/grammar.js.\n    npm run generate:fixtures  # Generate test fixtures (FTL \xe2\x86\x92 JSON AST).\n\n    npm run build:guide        # Build the HTML version of the Guide.\n\n    npm run bench              # Run the performance benchmark on large FTL.\n\n## Other Implementations\n\nThis repository contains the reference implementation of the parser. Other implementations exist which should be preferred for use in production and in tooling.\n\n  - The JavaScript implementation at [`fluent.js`](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js), including the [React bindings](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-react).\n  - The Python implementation at [`python-fluent`](https://github.com/projectfluent/python-fluent).\n  - The Rust implementation at [`fluent-rs`](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent-rs).\n\nWe also know about the following community-driven implementations:\n\n  - [`Fluent.Net`](https://github.com/blushingpenguin/Fluent.Net) by [@blushingpenguin](https://github.com/blushingpenguin). See [#93](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent/issues/93) for more info.\n  - A Java/Kotlin implementation has been requested in [#158](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent/issues/158).\n  - [`elm-fluent`](https://github.com/elm-fluent/elm-fluent) by [@spookylukey](https://github.com/spookylukey/)\n  - A Lua implementation effort is underway at [`fluent-lua`](https://github.com/alerque/fluent-lua) by [@alerque](https://github.com/alerque).\n  - A D implementation effort is underway at [`fluentd`](https://github.com/SirNickolas/fluentd) by [@SirNickolas](https://github.com/SirNickolas).\n\n## Learn More and Discuss\n\nFind out more about Project Fluent at [projectfluent.org][] and discuss the future of Fluent at [Mozilla Discourse][].\n\n[Fluent Syntax Guide]: http://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide\n[projectfluent.org]: http://projectfluent.org\n[Mozilla Discourse]: https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/fluent\n'
