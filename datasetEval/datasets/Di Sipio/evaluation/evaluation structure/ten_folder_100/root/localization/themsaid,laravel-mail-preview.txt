Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require themsaid/laravel-mail-preview\n```\n\nThen publish the config file:\n\n```\nphp artisan vendor:publish --provider="Themsaid\\MailPreview\\MailPreviewServiceProvider"\n```\n\nFinally, change `MAIL_DRIVER` to `preview` in your `.env` file:\n\n```\nMAIL_DRIVER=preview\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nEverytime an email is sent, an `.html` and `.eml` file will be generated in `storage/email-previews` with a name that includes the first recipient and the subject:\n\n```\n1457904864_jack_at_gmail_com_invoice_000234.html\n1457904864_jack_at_gmail_com_invoice_000234.eml\n```\n\nYou can open the `.html` file in a web browser, or open the `.eml` file in your default email client to have a realistic look\nat the final output.\n\n### Preview in a web browser\n\nWhen you open the `.html` file in a web browser you\'ll be able to see how your email will look, however there might be\nsome differences that varies from one email client to another.\n\nAt the beginning of the generated file you\'ll find an HTML comment with all the message info:\n\n```html\n<!--\nFrom:{"info@acme.com":"Acme HQ"},\nto:{"jack@gmail.com":"Jack Black"},\nreply-to:{"info@acme.com"},\ncc:[{"finance@acme.com":"Acme Finance"}, {"management@acme.com":"Acme Management"}],\nbcc:null,\nsubject:Invoice #000234\n-->\n```\n\n## Package Configurations\nFrom the `config/mailpreview.php` file you\'ll be able to change the output location of the preview files as well as the maximum lifetime for keeping previews, after this time old previews will get removed.\n\n### Logged out after clicked on the preview link\nYou will always lose your current session if you click on the generated notification link. This is because Laravel stores the session in an encrypted cookie. To change this behavior, you have to adjust the `middleware` property in the `config/mailpreview.php` file to match the following snippet:\n\n```php\n    \'middleware\' => [\n        \\App\\Http\\Middleware\\EncryptCookies::class,\n    ],\n```\n'
