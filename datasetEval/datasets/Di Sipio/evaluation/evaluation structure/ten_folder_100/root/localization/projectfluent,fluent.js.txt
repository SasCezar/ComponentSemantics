b"Project Fluent [![Build Status][travisimage]][travislink]\n=========================================================\n\n[travisimage]: https://travis-ci.org/projectfluent/fluent.js.svg?branch=master\n[travislink]: https://travis-ci.org/projectfluent/fluent.js\n\nFluent.js is a JavaScript implementation of Project Fluent, a localization\nframework designed to unleash the expressive power of the natural language.\n\nProject Fluent keeps simple things simple and makes complex things possible.\nThe syntax used for describing translations is easy to read and understand.  At\nthe same time it allows, when necessary, to represent complex concepts from\nnatural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations, and others.\n\n\nPackages\n--------\n\nFluent.js consists of a set of packages which have different use-cases and can\nbe installed independently of each other.\n\n  - [@fluent/bundle](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-bundle)\n  - [@fluent/dedent](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-dedent)\n  - [@fluent/dom](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-dom)\n  - [@fluent/langneg](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-langneg)\n  - [@fluent/react](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-react)\n  - [@fluent/sequence](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-sequence)\n  - [@fluent/syntax](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-syntax)\n\nYou can install each of the above packages via `npm`, e.g. `npm install\nfluent-react`.  See the end of this `README` for instructions on how to build\n`fluent.js` locally.\n\n\nLearn the FTL syntax\n--------------------\n\nFTL is a localization file format used for describing translation resources.\nFTL stands for _Fluent Translation List_.\n\nFTL is designed to be simple to read, but at the same time allows to represent\ncomplex concepts from natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations,\nand others.\n\n    hello-user = Hello, { $username }!\n\n[Read the Fluent Syntax Guide][] in order to learn more about the syntax.  If\nyou're a tool author you may be interested in the formal [EBNF grammar][].\n\n[Read the Fluent Syntax Guide]: https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/\n[EBNF grammar]: https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent/tree/master/spec\n\n\nDiscuss\n-------\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on Project Fluent!  Whether you're a localizer looking \nfor a better way to express yourself in your language, or a developer trying to \nmake your app localizable and multilingual, or a hacker looking for a project \nto contribute to, please do get in touch!\n\n - Discourse: https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/fluent\n\n\nGet Involved\n------------\n\nFluent.js is open-source, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  We \nencourage everyone to take a look at our code and we'll listen to your \nfeedback.\n\n\nLocal Development\n-----------------\n\nHacking on `fluent.js` is easy! To quickly get started clone the repo:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js.git\n    $ cd fluent.js\n\nYou'll need node.js 8 LTS (v8.9.0 and up). Older 8.x versions and 7.x\nversions have been reported to work as well. node.js 6.x is not supported.\n\nInstall the build tools used by all packages (Babel, Rollup, Mocha etc.):\n\n    $ npm install\n\nInstall dependencies of individual `fluent.js` packages which are required for\npassing tests:\n\n    $ make deps\n\nBuild all packages at once:\n\n    $ make\n\n\xe2\x80\xa6which is equivalent to:\n\n    $ make lint\n    $ make test\n    $ make build\n\nYou can also `cd` into a package's directory and issue the above `make`\ncommands from there.  Only this one package will be affected.\n"
