Move the folder to an appropriate location such\nas the Applications folder.\n\n\n\nInstalling OmegaT (Linux)\n=========================\n\nPlace the archive in any suitable folder and unpack it. OmegaT is then ready to\nbe launched.\n\nYou can however obtain a neater and more user-friendly installation by using the\ninstallation script (linux-install.sh). To use this script, open a terminal\nwindow (console), change folder to the folder containing OmegaT.jar and the\nlinux-install.sh script, and execute the script with ./linux-install.sh.\n\n\n\nInstalling OmegaT (Solaris, FreeBSD, etc.)\n=========================================\n\nPlace the archive in any suitable folder and unpack it. OmegaT is then ready to\nbe launched.\n\n\n\nUsing Java Web Start for installing OmegaT (all platforms)\n===========================================================\n\nIf you have already Java installed on your system, one way to install OmegaT is\nto use Java Web Start.\n\nFor this purpose download the following file and then execute it:\n\n  https://omegat.sourceforge.net/webstart/OmegaT.jnlp\n\nIt will install the correct environment for your computer and the application\nitself on the first run. Later calls do not need to be online.\n\n\n\nLaunching OmegaT (Windows)\n==========================\n\nIf, during installation, you have created a shortcut on the desktop,\ndouble-click on that shortcut.\n\nThe installer can create shortcuts for you in the start menu, on the desktop and\nin the quick launch area. You can also manually drag the file OmegaT.exe to the\nstart menu, the desktop or the quick launch area to link it from there.\n\nIf you can see the file OmegaT but not OmegaT.exe in your File Manager (Windows\nExplorer), change the settings so that file extensions are displayed.\n\n\n\nLaunching OmegaT (Mac)\n======================\n\nDouble-click on the OmegaT application.\n\nYou may drag the OmegaT application to your dock or to the toolbar of a Finder\nwindow to be able to launch it from any location. You can also launch it from\nthe Spotlight search field.\n\n\n\nLaunching OmegaT (Linux)\n========================\n\nIf you used linux-install.sh script, you should be able to launch OmegaT with:\n\n    Alt+F2\n\nand then:\n\n    omegat\n\nFor a more user-friendly way of launching OmegaT, you can use the Kaptain script\nprovided (omegat.kaptn). To use this script you must first install Kaptain. You\ncan then launch the Kaptain launch script with:\n\n    Alt+F2\n\nand then:\n\n    omegat.kaptn\n\n\n\nLaunching OmegaT from the command line (all systems)\n====================================================\n\nThe command to launch OmegaT is:\n\n    cd <folder where the file OmegaT.jar is located>\n\n    <name and path of the Java executable file> -jar OmegaT.jar\n\n(The Java executable file is the file java on Linux and java.exe on Windows.  If\nJava is installed at system level and is in the command path, the full path need\nnot be entered.)\n\n\n\nContributors\n============\n\nOmegaT is the original work of Keith Godfrey.\n\nAaron Madlon-Kay is the OmegaT project manager.\n\nCurrent team:\n(alphabetical order)\n\n- Vincent Bidaux (documentation manager)\n- Marco Cevoli (Telegram community manager)\n- Jean-Christophe Helary (Twitter community manager)\n- Kos Ivantsof (localisation manager)\n- Concepci\xc3\xb3n Martin (Facebook community manager)\n- Briac Pilpr\xc3\xa9 (webmaster)\n- Lucie Vecerova (Facebook community manager)\n\nContributions to the code are documented in /docs/contributors.txt.\n\nPrevious contributors include:\n(alphabetical order)\n\n- Anthony Baldwin (localisation manager)\n- Didier Briel (project manager)\n- Alex Buloichik (lead developer)\n- Sabine Cretella\n- Dmitri Gabinski\n- Jean-Christophe Helary (support group owner, localisation manager)\n- Maxym Mykhalchuk (lead developer)\n- Samuel Murray\n- Henry Pijffers (release manager)\n- Marc Prior (project co-ordinator, webmaster)\n- Vito Smolej (documentation manager)\n\nand many, many more very helpful people\n\n(If you think you have significantly contributed to the OmegaT Project but you\n(don't see your name on the lists, feel free to contact us.)\n\n\n\nUseful links\n============\n\nThe most current info about OmegaT can be found at:\n\n  https://omegat.org/\n\nUser support resources:\n\n  https://omegat.org/support\n\nRequests for Enhancements (in English), at the SourceForge site:\n\n  https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/\n\nBug reports (in English), at the SourceForge site:\n\n  https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/\n"
