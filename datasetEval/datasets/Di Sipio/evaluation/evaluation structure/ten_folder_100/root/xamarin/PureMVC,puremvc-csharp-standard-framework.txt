b'## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) C# Standard Framework\n\nPureMVC is a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) design meta-pattern. This is the specific implementation for the [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) language. It does not support [modular programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) since it uses [Singletons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) as Core actors rather than the [Multiton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiton) used in the [MultiCore](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-csharp-multicore-framework/wiki) Version.\n\n* [API Docs](http://puremvc.org/pages/docs/CSharp/standard/)\n* [Unit Tests](http://puremvc.org/pages/images/screenshots/PureMVC-Shot-CSharp-Standard-UnitTests.png)\n* [Discussion](http://forums.puremvc.org/index.php?board=72.0)\n* [Standard Version Overview Presentation](http://puremvc.tv/#P100)\n* [Legacy Implementation](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-csharp-standard-framework/tree/3.2.0)\n\n## Nuget Installation\n`dotnet add package PureMVC`\n\n## Platforms / Technologies\n* [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))\n* [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10)\n* [Xamarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xamarin)\n* [Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox)\n* [Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect)\n* [HoloLens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_HoloLens)\n\n## Status\nProduction - [Version 4.1](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-csharp-standard-framework/blob/master/VERSION)\n\n## License\n* PureMVC Standard Framework for C# - Copyright \xc2\xa9 2017 [Saad Shams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muizz)\n* PureMVC - Copyright \xc2\xa9 2017 [Futurescale, Inc](http://futurescale.com) \n* All rights reserved.\n\n* Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n  * Neither the name of Futurescale, Inc., PureMVC.org, nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
