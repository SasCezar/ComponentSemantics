b'# PdfSharpCore\n\n**PdfSharpCore** is a partial port of [PdfSharp.Xamarin](https://github.com/roceh/PdfSharp.Xamarin/) for .NET Standard\nAdditionally MigraDoc has been ported as well (from version 1.32).\nImages have been implemented with [ImageSharp](https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/), which is still in Alpha. They State on their readme that it is still in Alpha status and shouldn\'t be used in productive environments. Since I didn\'t find any good alternatives it\'s still used.\n\nImageSharp beeing Alpha isn\'t a big issure either since this code isn\'t by far done yet. So please chime in ;)\n\n**PdfSharp.Xamarin** is a partial port of [PdfSharp](http://www.pdfsharp.net/) for iOS and Android using Xamarin, it allows for creation and modification of PDF files.\n\n\n\n###### Example project \n\nThere was an example project here. <br />\nI\'ve removed it from this project, and put it into a separate solution. \nYou can find it [here](https://github.com/ststeiger/Stammbaum).<br />\nThere\'s a default font-resolver in [FontResolver.cs](https://github.com/ststeiger/PdfSharpCore/blob/master/PdfSharpCore/Utils/FontResolver.cs).<br />\nIt should work on Windows, Linux, OSX and Azure. <br />\nSome limitations apply. <br />\nSee open issues. \n\n\n## Example usage \n\n```cs\n//See the "Example" Project for a MigraDoc example\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n    GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver = new FontResolver();\n    \n    var document = new PdfDocument();\n    var page = document.AddPage();\n    var gfx = XGraphics.FromPdfPage(page);\n    var font = new XFont("OpenSans", 20, XFontStyle.Bold);\n            \n    gfx.DrawString("Hello World!", font, XBrushes.Black, new XRect(20, 20, page.Width, page.Height), XStringFormats.Center);\n\n    document.Save("test.pdf");\n}\n\n//This implementation is obviously not very good --> Though it should be enough for everyone to implement their own.\npublic class FontResolver : IFontResolver\n{\n    public byte[] GetFont(string faceName)\n    {\n        using(var ms = new MemoryStream())\n        {\n            using(var fs = File.Open(faceName, FileMode.Open))\n            {\n                fs.CopyTo(ms);\n                ms.Position = 0;\n                return ms.ToArray();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        public FontResolverInfo ResolveTypeface(string familyName, bool isBold, bool isItalic)\n        {\n            if (familyName.Equals("OpenSans", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase))\n            {\n                if (isBold && isItalic)\n                {\n                    return new FontResolverInfo("OpenSans-BoldItalic.ttf");\n                }\n                else if (isBold)\n                {\n                    return new FontResolverInfo("OpenSans-Bold.ttf");\n                }\n                else if (isItalic)\n                {\n                    return new FontResolverInfo("OpenSans-Italic.ttf");\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    return new FontResolverInfo("OpenSans-Regular.ttf");\n                }\n            }\n            return null;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2005-2007 empira Software GmbH, Cologne (Germany)  \nModified work Copyright (c) 2016 David Dunscombe\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
