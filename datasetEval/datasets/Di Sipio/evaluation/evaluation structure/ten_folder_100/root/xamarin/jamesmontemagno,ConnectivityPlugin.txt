b"## Connectivity Plugin for Xamarin and Windows\n\nSimple cross platform plugin to check connection status of mobile device, gather connection type, bandwidths, and more.\n\n## Documentation\nGet started by reading through the [Connectivity Plugin documentation](https://jamesmontemagno.github.io/ConnectivityPlugin/).\n\n## NuGet\n* Available on NuGet: [Xam.Plugin.Connectivity](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugin.Connectivity) [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Xam.Plugin.Connectivity.svg?label=NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugin.Connectivity/)\n\n## Build: \n* [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/k6l4x6ovp5ysfbar?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JamesMontemagno/connectivityplugin)\n* CI NuGet Feed: https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/connectivityplugin\n\n### The Future: [Xamarin.Essentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/essentials/index?WT.mc_id=docs-github-jamont)\n\nI have been working on Plugins for Xamarin for a long time now. Through the years I have always wanted to create a single, optimized, and official package from the Xamarin team at Microsoft that could easily be consumed by any application. The time is now with [Xamarin.Essentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/essentials/index?WT.mc_id=docs-github-jamont), which offers over 50 cross-platform native APIs in a single optimized package. I worked on this new library with an amazing team of developers and I highly highly highly recommend you check it out.\n\nI will continue to work and maintain my Plugins, but I do recommend you checkout Xamarin.Essentials to see if it is a great fit your app as it has been for all of mine!\n\n## Platform Support\n\n|Platform|Version|\n| ------------------- | :------------------: |\n|Xamarin.iOS|iOS 6+|\n|tvOS - Apple TV|All|\n|Xamarin.Android|API 10+|\n|Windows 10 UWP|10+|\n|Xamarin.Mac|All|\n|.NET 4.5/WPF|All|\n|.NET Core|2.0+|\n|Tizen|4.0+|\n\n### Created By: [@JamesMontemagno](http://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno)\n* Twitter: [@JamesMontemagno](http://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno)\n* Blog: [MotzCod.es](http://motzcod.es), [Micro Blog](http://motz.micro.blog)\n* Podcasts: [Merge Conflict](http://mergeconflict.fm), [Coffeehouse Blunders](http://blunders.fm), [The Xamarin Podcast](http://xamarinpodcast.com)\n* Video: [The Xamarin Show on Channel 9](http://xamarinshow.com), [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/jamesmontemagno) \n# Contribution\n\nThank you for your interest in contributing to the Connectivity plugin!
