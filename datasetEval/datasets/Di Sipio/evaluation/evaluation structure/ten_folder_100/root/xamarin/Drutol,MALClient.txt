I\'m not proud of these but I\'m not planning to rewrite them. Stuff that has been added later on is nicer and somewhat decently organised. I started this app when I knew nothing so yeah, works but code is smelly.\n### "Protocol"\n\nIf you\'d like for some reason to launch my app externally you can do so by using this protocol:\n```\nmalclient://<your everyday MAL link>\n```\nList of all accepted urls can be found [here](https://github.com/Drutol/MALClient/blob/714a73a3f4389a3212843fda243c1034c7347144/MALClient.XShared/Utils/MalLinkParser.cs)\n\n### Icon\n\nIcon was donated by @richardbmx!
