b'# Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for .NET, UWP, NetCore, Xamarin Android and iOS\n\nThe MSAL library for .NET is part of the [Microsoft identity platform for developers](https://aka.ms/aaddevv2) (formerly named Azure AD) v2.0. It enables you to acquire security tokens to call protected APIs. It uses industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. The library also supports [Azure AD B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory-b2c/).\n\nQuick links:\n\n| [Conceptual documentation](https://aka.ms/msalnet) | [Getting Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/#quickstarts) | [Sample Code](https://aka.ms/aaddevsamplesv2) | [Library Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client?view=azure-dotnet) | [Support](README.md#community-help-and-support) |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |\n\n## Nuget packages\n\nReleased     | Nightly\n-----------------------------|-------------------------\n [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Microsoft.Identity.Client.svg?style=flat-square&label=nuget&colorB=00b200)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client/) | [![MyGet](https://img.shields.io/myget/aad-clients-nightly/vpre/Microsoft.Identity.Client.svg?style=flat-square&label=myget&colorB=ff0000)](https://www.myget.org/feed/aad-clients-nightly/package/nuget/Microsoft.Identity.Client)\n\n## Build Status\n \n[![Build Status](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_apis/build/status/CI/DotNet/.NET%20MSAL%20CI%20(YAML)?branchName=master)](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_build/latest?definitionId=922&branchName=master)\n\n## Release notes, roadmap and SLA\n\n### Release notes and roadmap\n\nMSAL.NET roadmap is available from [Roadmap](../../wiki#roadmap) in the [Wiki pages](https://aka.ms/msal-net), along with release notes.\n\n### Support SLA\n\nMSAL.NET became Generally Available with MSAL.NET 3.0.8. Since MSAL.NET moved to 4.x\n\n- Major versions are supported for twelve months after the release of the next major version.\n- Minor versions older than N-1 are not supported.\n  > Minor versions are bugfixes or features with non-breaking (additive) API changes.  It is expected apps can upgrade.  Therefore, we will not patch old minor versions of the library. You should also confirm, in issue repros, that you are using the latest minor version before the MSAL.NET team spends time investigating an issue.\n\n## Using MSAL.NET\n\n- The conceptual documentation is currently available from the [Microsoft identity platform documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview) and our [Wiki pages](https://aka.ms/msal-net)\n- The reference documentation is available from the dotnet APIs reference in [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client?view=azure-dotnet)\n- A number of quickstarts are available for:\n  - [.NET desktop application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-windows-desktop)\n  - [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-uwp)\n  - [.NET Core daemon console](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-netcore-daemon)\n- Code samples are available from [Samples](https://aka.ms/aaddevsamplesv2)\n\n## Where do I file issues\n\nThis is the correct repo to file [issues](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues)\n\n## Requirements\n\nOperating system:\n* Windows 7 or greater\n\nPlatform of choice:\n* .NET 4.5 or greater\n* .NET Core 2.1 or greater\n* .NET Standard 1.3\n* Mono Android 9.0\n* UAP 10.0\n* Xamarin.iOS 10\n* Xamarin.Mac 2.0\n \n## Community Help and Support\n\nWe use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/msal) with the community to provide support. We highly recommend you ask your questions on Stack Overflow first and browse existing issues to see if someone has asked your question before.\n\nIf you find and bug or have a feature request, please raise the issue on [GitHub Issues](../../issues).\n\nTo provide a recommendation, visit our [User Voice page](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169401-azure-active-directory).\n\n## Contribute\n\nWe enthusiastically welcome contributions and feedback.

We recommend you always take the latest version of our library in your app when possible. We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) so you can control the risk associated with updating your app. As an example, always downloading the latest minor version number (e.g. x.*y*.x) ensures you get the latest security and feature enhancements but our API surface remains the same. You can always see the latest version and release notes under the Releases tab of GitHub.\n\n## Security Reporting\n\nIf you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) with as much detail as possible. Your submission may be eligible for a bounty through the [Microsoft Bounty](http://aka.ms/bugbounty) program. Please do not post security issues to GitHub Issues or any other public site. We will contact you shortly upon receiving the information. We encourage you to get notifications of when security incidents occur by visiting [this page](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948) and subscribing to Security Advisory Alerts.\n\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
