b'# Parse SDK for .NET\n[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/uoit0ona7m3x9bw6?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ParseCommunity/parse-sdk-dotnet)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/parse-community/Parse-SDK-dotNET/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/parse-community/Parse-SDK-dotNET)\n[![Nuget][nuget-svg]][nuget-link]\n[![License][license-svg]][license-link]\n[![Join The Conversation](https://img.shields.io/discourse/https/community.parseplatform.org/topics.svg)](https://community.parseplatform.org/c/parse-server)\n[![Backers on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/parse-server/backers/badge.svg)](#backers)\n[![Sponsors on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/parse-server/sponsors/badge.svg)](#sponsors)\n![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/ParsePlatform.svg?label=Follow%20us%20on%20Twitter&style=social)\n\n## Getting Started\nThe latest stable release of the SDK is available as a [NuGet package][nuget-link]. Note that the latest package currently available on the official distribution channel is quite old.\nTo use the most up-to-date code, build this project and reference the generated NuGet package.\n\n## Using the Code\nMake sure you are using the project\'s root namespace:\n\n```cs\nusing Parse;\n```\n\nThen, in your program\'s entry point, paste the following code, with the text reflecting your application and Parse Server setup emplaced between the quotation marks.\n\n```cs\nParseClient.Initialize(new ParseClient.Configuration\n{\n    ApplicationID = "",\n    Key = "",\n    ServerURI = ""\n});\n```\n\n`ApplicationID` is your app\'s `ApplicationId` field from your Parse Server.\n`Key` is your app\'s `DotNetKey` field from your Parse Server.\n`ServerURI` is the full URL to your web-hosted Parse Server.\n\nIf you would like to, you can also set the `MasterKey` property, which will allow the SDK to bypass any CLPs and object permissions that are set. This property should be compatible with read-only master keys as well.\n\nThere are also a few optional parameters you can choose to set if you prefer or are experiencing issues with the SDK; sometimes the operation that generates values for these properties automatically can fail unexpectedly, causing the SDK to not be able to initialize, so these properties are provided to give you the ability to bypass that operation by providing the details outright.\n\n`StorageConfiguration` represents some metadata information usually collected reflectively about the project for the purpose of data caching.\n`VersionInfo` represents some version information usually collected reflectively about the project for the purposes of data caching and metadata collection for installation object creation.\n\nTo find full usage instructions for the latest stable release, please visit the [Parse docs website][parse-docs-link]. Please note that the latest stable release is quite old and does not reflect the work being done at the moment.\n\n## Building The Library\nYou can build the library from Visual Studio Code (with the proper extensions), Visual Studio 2017 Community and higher, or Visual Studio for Mac 7 and higher. You can also build the library using the command line:\n\n### On Windows or any .NET Core compatible Unix-based system with the .NET Core SDK installed:\n```batch\ndotnet build Parse.sln\n```\n\nResults can be found in either `Parse/bin/Release/netstandard2.0/` or `Parse/bin/Debug/netstandard2.0/` relative to the root project directory, where `/` is the path separator character for your system.\n\n## How Do I Contribute?\nWe want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.
