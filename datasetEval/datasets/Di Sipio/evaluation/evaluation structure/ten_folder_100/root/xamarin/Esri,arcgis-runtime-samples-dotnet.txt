b'# ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET samples\n\nThis project contains samples for the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET including WPF, UWP and Xamarin platforms.\n\n## Samples tables of contents\n\nSee each platform\'s TOC:\n\n* [WPF](src/WPF)\n* [Universal Windows Platform](src/UWP)\n* [Xamarin.Android](src/Android)\n* [Xamarin.iOS](src/iOS)\n* [Xamarin.Forms](src/Forms)\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Fork and then clone the repo or download the .zip file. \n2. Confirm the supported system configuration for the API of interest in the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET:\n    * [WPF](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/wpf/guide/system-requirements.htm)\n    * [UWP](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/uwp/guide/system-requirements.htm)\n    * [Xamarin.Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/android/guide/system-requirements.htm)\n    * [Xamarin.iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/ios/guide/system-requirements.htm)\n    * [Xamarin.Forms](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/forms/guide/system-requirements.htm)\n3. For the platform you want to view: open the solution, restore NuGet packages, build, and run the application\n    * WPF: `src\\Desktop\\ArcGISRuntime.WPF.Viewer.sln`  \n    * UWP: `src\\Windows\\ArcGISRuntime.UWP.Viewer.sln`  \n    * Xamarin.Android: `src\\Android\\ArcGISRuntime.Xamarin.Samples.Android.sln`  \n    * Xamarin.iOS: `src\\iOS\\ArcGISRuntime.Xamari.Samples.iOS.sln`  \n    * Xamarin.Forms: `src\\Windows\\ArcGISRuntime.Xamarin.Samples.Forms.sln`  \n  \n    or\n  \n    * All: `src\\ArcGISRuntime.Viewers.All.sln`\n    * Windows ( WPF / UWP ): `src\\ArcGISRuntime.Viewers.Windows.sln`\n    * Xamarin (iOS, Android, Forms): `src\\ArcGISRuntime.Viewers.Xamarin.sln`  \n  \nNotes:\n\nWhen compiling Universal Windows Platform samples, make sure that you are compiling against x86/x64/ARM platform and not using AnyCPU.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Supported system configurations for:\n  * [WPF](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/wpf/guide/system-requirements.htm)\n  * [UWP](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/uwp/guide/system-requirements.htm)\n  * [Xamarin.Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/android/guide/system-requirements.htm)\n  * [Xamarin.iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/ios/guide/system-requirements.htm)\n  * [Xamarin.Forms](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/forms/guide/system-requirements.htm)\n\n## Resources\n\n* [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](http://esriurl.com/dotnetsdk)\n\n## Offline data\n\nSeveral samples require local data to function properly. That data is downloaded to local storage automatically at runtime. \nThis process is handled by the `DataManager` class (located in the \'Managers\' folder in each view project). Samples\nthat use the data manager to download their data are differentiated as follows:\n\n* They have `RequiresOfflineData` set to true in their metadata.json files\n* They have one or more entries under `DataItemIds` in their metadata.json files (these are portal item Ids)\n* They use the data manager to identify the correct path for their offline files at run time\n\nSee the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-dotnet/wiki/Contributing) for more detailed information.\n\n## Issues\n\nFind a bug or want to request a new feature?
