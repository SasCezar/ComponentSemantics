b'# XSVim [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/XSVim/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/XSVim/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nosami/XSVim.svg?branch=7.4)](https://travis-ci.org/nosami/XSVim)\n\n\n# Installation\n\nInteract with Visual Studio for Mac as follows:\n\n```\nVisual Studio -> Extensions -> Gallery -> IDE Extensions -> "VIM" -> Install\n```\n\nThen close the current document that you are working on and open a new document to activate the plugin.\n\n## 8.1 New Editor\n\nUnfortunately, this addin does not work yet with the new editor that was made default in 8.1. To use this addin, make sure that the old editor is in use.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/667194/59626372-9de68280-9133-11e9-9fbe-035553d7042e.png)\n\nAlternatively, I have been working on making VsVim work for the new editor. If you want to try this out, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/VsVim/VsVim/pull/2733#issuecomment-538998555)\n\n# What works?\n\nMost Vim commands should work. If you see something that doesn\'t work, please file an issue. There\'s a good chance that I just don\'t know about it.\n\n# What doesn\'t work\n\n- Vim split windows. XSVim uses VS for Mac\'s side by side mode to emulate this, but it\'s only possible to have 2 vertical split windows. `<C-w>s` and `<C-w>v` both switch to side by side mode.\n- Visual block mode works for most tasks, but there are some differences in the way that VS handles virtual spacing at the end of lines.\n- Selecting text with the mouse or using cmd+arrow keys doesn\'t switch to Visual mode\n- No leader key support or configurable key bindings.\n\n# Why don\'t the control keys work?\n\nSome Vim keybindings (such as Ctrl-F, Ctrl-D etc) conflict with VS\'s own built in keybindings. However, there is a keybinding scheme included that you may apply if you want (Visual Studio + Vim)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/667194/37340194-39775566-26b5-11e8-9119-58d171aa9a01.png)\n\n# Extras\n\n- `gd` - Goto declaration\n- `gu` - Find usages\n- `gb` - Go to base symbol\n- `gh` - Show tooltip at current caret location (`G`o `H`over)\n- `hjkl` support on the Solution Explorer pad and Test Explorer pad. Pressing `<esc>` on these will switch focus back to the last editor window. `jk` support on the Search Results pad.\n- Goto Pad shortcuts start with `gp`\n  - `gps` - Go to solution explorer \n  - `gpc` - Go to class pad\n  - `gpe` - Go to error list pad\n  - `gpt` - Go to Task List pad\n  - `gpp` - Go to Property pad\n  - `gpo` - Go to document outline pad\n  - `gpb` - Go to breakpoint pad\n  - `gpl` - Go to locals pad\n  - `gpw` - Go to watch pad\n  - `gpi` - Go to immediate pad\n  - `gpn` - Go to F# Interactive pad\n  - `gpf` - When there is only one search results pad, go to it\n  - `gpf1` - When there is more than one search results pad, go to the 1st\n  - `gpf2` - When there is more than one search results pad, go to the 2nd....etc.\n  - `gpdt` - Go to debugger threads pad\n  - `gpds` - Go to debugger stack trace pad\n  - `gput` - Go to unit test pad\n  - `gpur` - Go to unit test results pad\n- Insert mode escape binding. See example screenshot to see how to configure `jj` to escape when in insert mode.\n\n![Insert mode escape screenshot](screenshots/InsertModeMapping.png)\n# Looking for the latest release?\n\nCheck the [release page](https://github.com/nosami/XSVim/releases) as there is usually a more recent version of the addin here than on the Visual Studio for Mac feed. Grab the .mpack file and install it via Visual Studio -> Extensions -> Install from file\n\n# Support & Contributions\n\nJump in our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/XSVim/Lobby) and introduce yourself. \n\n# With thanks to\n\n- @shirshov\n- @mdizzy\n- @tdfacer\n\n'
