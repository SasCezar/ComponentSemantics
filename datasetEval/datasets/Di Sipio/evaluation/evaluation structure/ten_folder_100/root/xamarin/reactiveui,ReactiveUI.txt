If the technician entered the correct sequence of machine codes in the correct order, then the resulting program behavior would satisfy the business requirements. Instead of telling a computer how to do its job, which error-prone and relies too heavily on the infallibility of the programmer, why don\'t we just tell it what its job is and let it figure the rest out?\n\nReactiveUI is inspired by the paradigm of Functional Reactive Programming, which allows you to model user input as a function that changes over time. This is super cool because it allows you to abstract mutable state away from your user interfaces and expresses the idea around a feature in one readable place whilst improving application testability. Reactive programming can look scary and complex at first glance, but the best way to describe reactive programming is to think of a spreadsheet:\n\n![](https://reactiveui.net/docs/frp-excel.gif)\n\n* Three cells, A, B, and C.\n* C is defined as the sum of A and B.\n* Whenever A or B changes, C reacts to update itself.\n\nThat\'s reactive programming: changes propagate throughout a system automatically. Welcome to the peanut butter and jelly of programming paradigms. For further information, please watch this video from the Xamarin Evolve conference - [Why You Should Be Building Better Mobile Apps with Reactive Programming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYEbUF4xs1Q) by Michael Stonis.\n\n<h2>NuGet Packages</h2>\n\nInstall the following packages to start building your own ReactiveUI app. <b>Note:</b> some of the platform-specific packages are required. This means your app won\'t perform as expected until you install the packages properly. See the <a href="https://reactiveui.net/docs/getting-started/installation/">Installation</a> docs page for more info.\n\n| Platform          | ReactiveUI Package                  | NuGet

have a text field, and whenever the user types something into it, you want to make a network request which searches for that query.\n\n![](http://i.giphy.com/xTka02wR2HiFOFACoE.gif)\n\n```csharp\npublic interface ISearchViewModel\n{\n    string SearchQuery { get; set; }\t \n    ReactiveCommand<string, IEnumerable<SearchResult>> Search { get; }\n    IEnumerable<SearchResult> SearchResults { get; }\n}\n```\n\n<h3>Define under what conditions a network request will be made</h3>\n\nWe\'re describing here, in a *declarative way*, the conditions in which the Search command is enabled. Now our Command IsEnabled is perfectly efficient, because we\'re only updating the UI in the scenario when it should change.\n\n```csharp\nvar canSearch = this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.SearchQuery, query => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(query));\n```\n\n<h3>Make the network connection</h3>\n\nReactiveCommand has built-in support for background operations and guarantees that this block will only run exactly once at a time, and that the CanExecute will auto-disable and that property IsExecuting will be set accordingly whilst it is running.\n\n```csharp\nSearch = ReactiveCommand.CreateFromTask(_ => searchService.Search(this.SearchQuery), canSearch);\n```\n\n<h3>Update the user interface</h3>\n\nReactiveCommands are themselves `IObservables`, whose values are the results from the async method, guaranteed to arrive on the UI thread. We\'re going to take the list of search results that the background operation loaded, and turn them into our SearchResults property declared as [`ObservableAsPropertyHelper<T>`](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/oaph/#example).\n\n```csharp\n_searchResults = Search.ToProperty(this, x => x.SearchResults);\n```\n\n<h3>Handling failures</h3>\n\nAny exception thrown from the [`ReactiveCommand.CreateFromTask`](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/commands/) gets piped to the `ThrownExceptions` Observable. Subscribing to this allows you to handle errors on the UI thread.\n\n```csharp\nSearch.ThrownExceptions.Subscribe(error => { /* Handle exceptions. */ });\n```\n\n<h3>Throttling network requests and automatic search execution behaviour</h3>\n\nWhenever the Search query changes, we\'re going to wait for one second of "dead airtime", then automatically invoke the subscribe command.\n\n```csharp\nthis.WhenAnyValue(x => x.SearchQuery)\n    .Throttle(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), RxApp.MainThreadScheduler)\n    .InvokeCommand(Search);\n```\n\n<h3>Binding our ViewModel to the platform-specific UI</h3>\n\nReactiveUI fully supports XAML markup bindings, but we have more to offer. [ReactiveUI Bindings](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/data-binding/) work on **all platforms**, including Xamarin Native and Windows Forms, and operate the same. Those bindings are strongly typed, and renaming a ViewModel property, or a control in the UI layout without updating the binding, the build will fail.\n\n```csharp\nthis.WhenActivated(cleanup => \n{\n    this.Bind(ViewModel, x => x.SearchQuery, x => x.TextBox)\n        .DisposeWith(cleanup);\n    this.OneWayBind(ViewModel, x => x.SearchResults, x => x.ListView)\n        .DisposeWith(cleanup);\n    this.BindCommand(ViewModel, x => x.Search, x => x.Button)\n        .DisposeWith(cleanup);\n});\n```\n\n<h3>Forget about INotifyPropertyChanged boilerplate code</h3>\n\n[ReactiveUI.Fody](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReactiveUI.Fody/) package allows you to decorate read-write properties with `Reactive` attribute \xe2\x80\x94 and code responsible for property change notifications will get injected into your property setters automatically at compile time. We use [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody) tooling to make this magic work.\n\n```csharp\npublic class ReactiveViewModel : ReactiveObject\n{\n    [Reactive] \n    public string SearchQuery { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nThe code above gets compiled into the following code:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ReactiveViewModel : ReactiveObject\n{\n    private string searchQuery;\n    public string SearchQuery \n    {\n        get => searchQuery;\n        set => this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged(ref searchQuery, value);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<h3>Validate user input on the fly</h3>\n\n[ReactiveUI.Validation](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI.Validation) provides a subset of functions to create validations, functioning in a reactive way. For those ViewModels which need validation, implement `ISupportsValidation`, then add validation rules to the ViewModel and finally bind to the validation rules in the View! See the [documentation](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/user-input-validation/) for more info. This package was created based on [jcmm33 work](https://github.com/jcmm33/ReactiveUI.Validation) and maintained by [alexmartinezm](https://github.com/alexmartinezm).\n\n```csharp\n// # ViewModel\n// Search query must not be empty. The selector is the property \n// name and the line below is a single property validator.\nthis.ValidationRule(\n    vm => vm.SearchQuery,\n    query => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(query),\n    "Please, provide a non-empty search query!");\n\n// # View\n// Bind any validations which reference the SearchQuery property \n// to the text of the QueryValidation UI control!\nthis.BindValidation(ViewModel, vm => vm.SearchQuery, view => view.QueryValidation.Text);\n```\n\n<h3>Add view model-based routing to your XAML views</h3>\n\nView model-based routing is supported for Xamarin.Forms, WinRT, UWP, Windows Forms, WPF and Avalonia Desktop applications. Create an [`IScreen`](https://reactiveui.net/api/reactiveui/iscreen/), register views for view models and navigate to your [`IRoutableViewModel`](https://reactiveui.net/api/reactiveui/iroutableviewmodel/)s by calling `Router.Navigate`. Then, bind the [`RoutingState`](https://reactiveui.net/api/reactiveui/routingstate/) to the platform-specific routed view host. See [routing documentation](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/routing/) for a getting started guide.\n\n```xml\n<rxui:ReactiveWindow\n    xmlns:rxui="http://reactiveui.net" \n    x:Class="ReactiveRouting.MainWindow"\n    x:TypeArguments="vm:MainViewModel"\n    xmlns:vm="clr-namespace:ReactiveRouting"\n    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"\n    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml">\n    <rxui:RoutedViewHost\n        Router="{Binding Router}"\n        HorizontalContentAlignment="Stretch"\n        VerticalContentAlignment="Stretch" />\n</rxui:ReactiveWindow>\n```\n\n<h2>Support</h2>\n\nIf you have a question, please see if any discussions in our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactiveui) have already answered it.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, here is our [Slack room](https://reactiveui.net/slack), where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are twitter savvy, you can tweet #reactiveui with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a \xf0\x9f\x90\x9c or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on GitHub.\n\n<h2>Contribute</h2>\n\nReactiveUI is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use.
