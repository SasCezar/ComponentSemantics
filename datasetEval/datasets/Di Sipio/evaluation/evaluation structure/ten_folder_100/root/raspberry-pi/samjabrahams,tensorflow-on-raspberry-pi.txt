b"# TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi\n\n## It's officially supported!\n\nAs of TensorFlow 1.9, Python wheels for TensorFlow are being [officially supported](https://medium.com/tensorflow/tensorflow-1-9-officially-supports-the-raspberry-pi-b91669b0aa0). As such, this repository is no longer recommended for your TensorFlow on RPi needs; use the official sources!\n\n## Pip installation\n\nYou can install the official wheel with the following commands, assuming you are using Raspbian 9:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install libatlas-base-dev\npip3 install tensorflow\n```\n\n[Check out the official TensorFlow website for more information.](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_raspbian)\n\n---\n\nIt was a fun ride! With Raspberry Pi support now official, I will no longer be looking to update this repository. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to continue maintaining the repo as much as I wanted, but it was amazing watching the community continue to thrive.\n\n-Sam"
