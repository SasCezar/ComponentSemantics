b'# It\'s Alive!\n![Lightning over Plexpod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MycroftAI/enclosure-picroft/stretch/lightning-2018-08-01.jpg )\n\n## Picroft - 2019-07-20 Stretch Lightning release\n\nPicroft is an enclosure for a Raspberry Pi 3 or 3B+ connected to a speaker and\nmicrophone, bringing Mycroft to anyone who wants a simple voice interface they\nhave complete control over.  This is built on top of the official Raspbian\nStretch Lite image.\n\nThe entire project is available as a pre-built micro-SD image ready to be\nburned and placed into a Raspberry Pi. You can download the pre-built image\nhere:\n\n [![Download img](https://github.com/MycroftAI/enclosure-picroft/raw/master/microsd-icon.png "Download img") Picroft Stable 2019-09-26 Stretch image](https://mycroft.ai/to/picroft-image)\n\nSHA-256: 2c1ec01d3e81beb910e5ff7275fb5b21537b58f071d2b10a33675d6597c71011\n\n[![Download img](https://github.com/MycroftAI/enclosure-picroft/raw/master/microsd-icon.png "Download img") Picroft Unstable 2019-11-01 Buster image](https://mycroft.ai/to/picroft-unstable)\n\nSHA-256: 53825a7a92851c6a35076c609121a27eddd4d9b17433455852023e759b753d5c\n\nOptionally you can build it yourself by following the [Recipe for building the image](image_recipe.md)\n\n## Requirements\n\n* **Stable Stretch image - Raspberry Pi 3 or 3B+**\n  <br>_Older Raspberry Pi versions do not have sufficient processing power,\n  and if they work they will be very slow_  \n  **Unstable Buster image - Raspberry Pi 4**  \n  The current unstable image is our first official image that supports the Raspberry Pi 4.\n* **Speaker**\n  <br>Any analog speaker, or an HDMI monitor with speaker\n* **Microphone**\n  <br>A [list of Community tested hardware](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/using-mycroft-ai/get-mycroft/picroft#tested-hardware) is available in our documentation.\n* **2.5 Amp or better power supply**\n  <br>Don\'t skimp on this!  It might appear to work, but you\'ll have weird\n  issues with a cheapo supply.\n* **MicroSD Card**\n  <br>8 GB or larger\n* HDMI Monitor and keyboard, only required during setup\n\n\n## Installation\n\n1) Download and burn the image to the SD card.<br/>See the RaspberryPi.org\'s\n   guide to\n   [Installing Operating System Images](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)\n   for detailed instructions on how to burn an image to your SD card.\n2) Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi\n3) Connect speaker, microphone, monitor and keyboard\n4) Apply power\n5) Follow the on-screen prompts to setup Picroft\n6) Follow the verbal prompts to pair your device to an account at\n   [Mycroft Home](http://home.mycroft.ai/#/device/add)\n7) Talk to Mycroft and enjoy!\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply speak to Picroft as you would to any Mycroft.  For example:\n\n    "Hey Mycroft, what time is it?"\n    "Mycroft, how tall was Abraham Lincoln?"\n\n\n## Older Versions\n* [Raspbian Jessie version](https://github.com/MycroftAI/enclosure-picroft/tree/master)\n\n## Help and more info\nTo re-run the setup wizard, use `mycroft-setup-wizard`.\nCheck out the Picroft wiki [here](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/picroft/).\nThere\'s also the general [Documentation](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/).\n\n## Customization\n* `audio_setup.sh` configures your specific audio setup.\n* `custom_setup.sh` is a stub meant to initialize anything before Mycroft\n  starts.  For example, initializing connected devices, or launching services.\n\n## Getting Help\n\nThere is an active *Picroft* community within the [Mycroft\'s Mattermost chat](https://chat.mycroft.ai/community/channels/picroft) which all are welcome to join!\n\n---\n\n### FAQ\n##### Q1) Why "Stretch Lightning"?\nBecause the image is built on Raspbian Stretch, and the lightning seen above\nwas captured from the roof the night I started this rework.\n\n##### Q2) Can I run this with a the Raspbian desktop GUI?\nSadly, not really.  A Raspberry Pi is powerful, but still not well suited to do\n_everything_ at once.  You can add other basic services on top of Picroft, but\nthe desktop GUI requires too many additional resources and neither Mycroft nor\nthe GUI end up running well.\n\n##### Q3) Can I run this with anything else?\nDepends on what you want to add.  Serving simple webpages or polling devices\nperiodically is probably fine.  Mining bitcoin won\'t.\n\n##### Q4) Can I run this on a Pi4?\nNot yet.  The current Picroft image is based on Raspbian Stretch Lite, and the\nRaspberry Pi 4 requires the Raspbian Buster.  Users have reported success with\na generic Linux install of Mycroft on top of a Raspbian Buster image, and we\nwill be creating an unstable Buster image very soon.\n'
