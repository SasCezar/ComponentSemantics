b'hcxdumptool\n==============\n\nSmall tool to capture packets from wlan devices.\nAfter capturing, upload the "uncleaned" cap here (https://wpa-sec.stanev.org/?submit)\nto see if your ap or the client is vulnerable by using common wordlists.\nConvert the cap to hccapx and/or to WPA-PMKID-PBKDF2 hashline (16800) with hcxpcaptool (hcxtools)\nand check if wlan-key or plainmasterkey was transmitted unencrypted.\n\n\nBrief description\n--------------\n\nStand-alone binaries - designed to run on Raspberry Pi\'s with installed Arch Linux.\nIt may work on other Linux systems (notebooks, desktops) and distributions, too.\n\n\nDetailed description\n--------------\n\n| Tool           | Description                                                                                            |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| hcxdumptool    | Tool to run several tests to determine if access points or clients are vulnerable                      |\n| hcxpioff       | Turns Raspberry Pi off via GPIO switch                                                                 |\n\n\nCompile\n--------------\n\nSimply run:\n\n```\nmake\nmake install (as super user)\n```\n\n\nCompile for Android\n--------------\n\nYou need:\n* Android NDK installed in your system and in path variable\n\n* This repository cloned with all submodules (`--recursive` flag in `git clone` or `git submodules update` command run)\n\nJust run `ndk-build` - built executables for some architectures should be created inside `libs` directory.\nCopy it to your phone and enjoy.\n\n\nRequirements\n--------------\n\n* Operatingsystem: Arch Linux (strict), Kernel >= 4.19 (strict). It may work on other Linux systems (notebooks, desktops) and distributions, too (no support for other distributions, no support for other operating systems). Don\'t use Kernel 4.4 (rt2x00 driver regression)\n\n* Chipset must be able to run in monitor mode and driver must support monitor mode. Recommended: MEDIATEK (MT7601) or RALINK (RT2870, RT3070, RT5370) chipset \n\n* libopenssl and openssl-dev installed\n\n* Raspberry Pi A, B, A+, B+, Zero (WH). (Recommended: Zero (WH) or A+, because of a very low power consumption), but notebooks and desktops may work, too.\n\n* GPIO hardware mod recommended (push button and LED).\n\n\nAdapters\n--------------\n\nhcxdumptool need full (monitor mode and full packet injection running all packet types) and exclusive access to the adapter! Otherwise it will not start!\n\nThe driver must support monitor mode and full packet injection, as well as ioctl() calls!\n\nNetlink (libnl) interfaces are not supported!\n\nGet information about VENDOR, model, chipset and driver here: https://wikidevi.com\n\nManufacturers do change chipsets without changing model numbers.

use hcxpcaptool -I to save them to file)\n\n* hcxdumptool is able to capture usernames from the wlan traffic\n  (for example: user name of a server authentication - use hcxpcaptool -U to save them to file)\n\n* Do not use a logical interface and leave the physical interface in managed mode\n\n* Do not use hcxdumptool in combination with aircrack-ng, reaver, bully or other tools which take access to the interface\n\n* Stop all services which take access to the physical interface (NetworkManager, wpa_supplicant,...)\n\n* Do not use tools like macchanger, as they are useless, because hcxdumptool uses its own random mac address space\n'
