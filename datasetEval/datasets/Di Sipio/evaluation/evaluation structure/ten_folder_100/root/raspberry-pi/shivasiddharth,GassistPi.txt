You can choose to either Enable or Disable the custom wakeword activation in the config.yaml file.  \n2. In the config.yaml file, under Wakewords, change the **"Custom_Wakeword"** to \'Enabled\' if you want to use the custom wakeword or set it to \'Disabled\' if you dont want to use the custom wakeword option.  \n3. For changes to take effect, you need to restart the assistant. Changing status while an instance of assistant is already running will not cause any change.  \n4. Create your custom snowboy model [here](https://snowboy.kitt.ai). Add the models to **/GassistPi/src/resources**  directory.\n5. Change the paths to the models in the config.yaml file.  \n6. To disable the default **"Ok Google"** hotword, set the **Ok_Google option to "Disabled"**.  \n7. Users using pushbutton.py or Pi Zero users have an option between using custom wakeword and GPIO trigerring. If custom wakeword is enabled, then GPIO trigger will not work. To enable GPIO triggering, set custom wakeword to \'Disabled\'.    \n\n************************************************\n### **PLAYING SPOTIFY PLAYLIST**  \n************************************************\n**NOTE: Spotify API currently only supports playback in a web browser, but DRM content is being blocked in the Raspberry Pi. As a roundabout approach, I have programmed the assistant to get the playlist details using Spotipy API and then fetch those tracks from YouTube. This custom program has a better accuracy than spotify playlist playback using mpsyt.**   \n\n1. Click [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and register for a spotify developer account, if you already don\'t have one.  \n2. In the developer\'s dashboard, choose "**CREATE A CLIENT ID**". In the pop-up window provide the requested details.  \n3. Click on the new app created and copy the CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET. Paste it in the config.yaml file in the indicated space.\n4.

Music streaming will send the CPU usage of Pi Zero into the orbit.**  \n\n************************************************\n### **MUSIC STREAMING FROM Google Music**  \n************************************************\nThe music streaming from Google Music uses [Gmusicapi](https://unofficial-google-music-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nRun the Google Music Authenticator once using:    \n```\n/home/${USER}/env/bin/python -u /home/${USER}/GassistPi/Extras/gmusicauth.py\n```\n\n### What you can do:\nPlay all your songs in loop using the syntax: **"Hey Google, Play all the songs from Google Music"**\n\nPlay songs added to the user created playlist (does not include: most played playlist, thumsup playlist, etc) using the syntax: **"Hey Google, Play songs from the first playlist from Google Music"**\nPlaylists are sorted by date created, if you have multiple playlists, use a similar syntax replacing first with second, third etc. Also you need to make suitable changes in the main.py (It has been commented in the script to help)\n\nPlay songs by a particular artist using the syntax: **"Hey Google, Play songs by artist YOUR_ARTIST_NAME from Google Music"**\n\nPlay songs from particular album using the syntax: **"Hey Google, Play songs from album YOUR_ALBUM_NAME from Google Music"**\n\n### What you cannot do at the moment: (some features may be added later):\nChange tracks\nShuffle tracks\nRepeat tracks\n\n**Due to the Pi Zero\'s limitations, and computationally intensive nature of the Google Music streaming feature, this action has not been enabled for Pi Zero.**  \n\n\n************************************************\n### **RADIO STREAMING**  \n************************************************\nDefault keyword for streaming radio is **radio**. For example, **play Radio 2** or **play Radio One** command will open the corresponding radio stream listed in the actions.py file.    \n\nRadio streaming has been enabled for both OK-Google and Custom hotwords/wakewords.\n\nUseful links for obtaining radio streaming links:   \nhttp://www.radiosure.com/stations/  \n\nhttp://www.live-radio.net/worldwide.shtml  \n\nhttp://worldradiomap.com/map/  \n\n**Due to the Pi Zero\'s limitations, users are advised to not use the Radio streaming feature. Radio streaming will send the CPU usage of Pi Zero into next galaxy.**  \n\n***********************************************  \n### **PARCEL TRACKING**  \n***********************************************  \nThe default keyword for tracking parcel is **parcel**. For example, you can say **where is my parcel** or **track my parcel**.  \n\nRegsiter for a free account with Aftership at https://www.aftership.com gnereate an API number and add parcels to the tracking list.\nThe generated API number should be added to the **actions.py** at the indicated location. For a better understanding follow the attached youtube video.\n\n<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=WOyYL46s-q0\n" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/WOyYL46s-q0/0.jpg"\nalt="Detailed Youtube Video" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>\n\n************************************************  \n### **RSS FEEDS STREAMING**  \n************************************************  \nDefault keywords for playing RSS feeds is **feed** or **news** or **quote**. Example usage, **top tech news** will play the top technology news, **top world news** will play top news related to different countires, **top sports news** will play the top sports related news and **quote of the day** will give some quotes.\n\nDo not mix the commands with **Play** as that has been associated with music streaming from YouTube.  \n\n**numfeeds** variable within the feed function in actions.py file is the feed limit. Certain RSS feeds can have upto 60 items and **numfeeds** variable limits the number of items to stream. The default value has been set to 10, which if you want can change.  \n\n\n************************************************  \n### **KODI INTEGRATION**  \n************************************************  \n### Enabling Kodi control    \nIn the config.yaml, under kodi, change control option from **\'Disabled\'** to **\'Enabled\'**.  \n\n### Adding YouTube API and Generating API Key\nThe Kodi integration uses YouTube Data API v3  for getting video links. First step is to add the API to the project and create an API KEY.\n1. Go to the projects page on your Google Cloud Console-> https://console.cloud.google.com/project  \n2.
