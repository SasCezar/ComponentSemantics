b'## Welcome to the Kubernetes on ARM project!\n\n#### Kubernetes on a Raspberry Pi? Is that possible?\n\n#### Yes, now it is (and has been since v1.0.1 with this project)\nImagine... Your own testbed for Kubernetes with cheap Raspberry Pis and friends. \n\n![Image of Kubernetes and Raspberry Pi](docs/raspberrypi-joins-kubernetes.png)\n\n#### **Are you convinced too, like me, that cheap ARM boards and Kubernetes is a match made in heaven?**    \n**Then, lets go!**\n\n## Important information\n\nThis project was published in September 2015 as the first fully working way to easily set up Kubernetes on ARM devices.\n\nYou can read my story [here](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2016/11/29/diversity-scholarship-series-programming-journey-becoming-kubernetes-maintainer).\n\nI worked on making it better non-stop until early 2016, when I started contributing the changes I\'ve made back to Kubernetes core.\nI strongly think that most of these features belong to the core, so everyone may take advantage of it, and so Kubernetes can be ported to even more platforms.\n\nSo I opened [kubernetes/kubernetes#17981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/17981) and started working on making Kubernetes cross-platform.\nTo date I\'ve ported the Kubernetes core to ARM, ARM 64-bit and PowerPC 64-bit Little-endian. Already in `v1.2.0`, binaries were released for ARM, and I used the official binaries in `v0.7.0` in Kubernetes on ARM.\n\nSince `v1.3.0` the `hyperkube` image has been built for both `arm` and `arm64`, which have made it possible to run Kubernetes officially the "kick the tires way".\nSo it has been possible to run `v1.3.x` Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi\xc2\xb4s (or whatever arm or arm64 device that runs docker) with the [docker-multinode](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy/tree/master/docker-multinode) deployment.\nHowever, docker-multinode has been [deprecated and removed](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-dev/iBs-EBCQxq0), and shouldn\'be be used anymore.\n\nI\'ve written a proposal about how to make Kubernetes available for multiple platforms [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/multi-platform.md)\n\nThen I also ported `kubeadm` to `arm` and `arm64`, and `kubeadm` is so much better than the docker-multinode deployment method I used earlier (before the features that kubeadm takes advantage of existed).\n\nSo now the officially recommended and supported way of running Kubernetes on ARM is by following the [`kubeadm getting started guide`](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/).\nSince I\'ve moved all the features this project had into the core, there\'s no big need for this project anymore.\n\n### Get your ARM device up and running Kubernetes in less than ten minutes\n\nI have a workshop how to create a Kubernetes cluster on ARM here now: https://github.com/luxas/kubeadm-workshop.\nPlease look there for information how to create a Kubernetes cluster on ARM or look at the [`kubeadm getting started guide`](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/).\n\n### Various related resources\n\n - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdzKQwMjg2w\n - http://slides.com/lucask/kubecon-berlin\n - https://github.com/luxas/kubeadm-workshop\n - http://blog.kubernetes.io/2017/01/stronger-foundation-for-creating-and-managing-kubernetes-clusters.html\n - https://luxaslabs.com/2016/12/31/2016-a-year-of-being-a-member-in-an-open-source-community/\n - https://twitter.com/kubernetesonarm\n - https://opensource.com/article/17/3/kubernetes-raspberry-pi\n - http://blog.hypriot.com/post/setup-kubernetes-raspberry-pi-cluster/\n'
