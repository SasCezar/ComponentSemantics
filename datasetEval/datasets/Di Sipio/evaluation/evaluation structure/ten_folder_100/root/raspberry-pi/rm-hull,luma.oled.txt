Likewise **max7219** has been renamed to\n`luma.led_matrix <https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.led_matrix>`_ so\nit can also take advantage of the common API.\n\nThe consequence is that any existing code that uses the old **ssd1306** package\nwill need to be updated. The changes should be limited to altering import\nstatements only, and are described in the \n`upgrade documentation <https://luma-oled.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrade.html>`_.\n\nLicense\n-------\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014-2019 Richard Hull and contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
