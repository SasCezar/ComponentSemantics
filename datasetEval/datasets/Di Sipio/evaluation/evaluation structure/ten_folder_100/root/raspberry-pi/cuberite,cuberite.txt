Cuberite is compatible with the Java Edition Minecraft client.\n\nCuberite runs on Windows, *nix and Android operating systems. This includes Android phones and tablets as well as Raspberry Pis.\n\nCurrently we support Release 1.8 - 1.12.2 Minecraft protocol versions.\n\nSubscribe to [the newsletter][1] for important updates and project news.\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are several ways to obtain Cuberite.\n\n### Binaries\n\n- The easiest method is downloading for Windows or Linux from the [website][2].\n- You can use the EasyInstall script for Linux and macOS, which automatically downloads the correct binary. The script is described below.\n- You can also obtain a binary from the [buildserver archive][3].\n\n#### The EasyInstall script\n\nThis script will download the correct binary from the project site.\n\n    curl -sSfL https://download.cuberite.org | sh\n\n### Compiling\n\n- You can compile automatically for Linux, macOS and FreeBSD with the `compile.sh` script. The script is described below.\n- You can also compile manually. See [COMPILING.md][4].\n\nCompiling may provide better performance (1.5-3x as fast) and it supports more operating systems.\n\n#### The compile.sh script\n\nThis script downloads the source code and compiles it. The script is smart enough to notify you of missing dependencies and instructing you on how to install them. The script doesn\'t work for Windows.\n\nUsing curl:\n\n    sh -c "$(curl -sSfL -o - https://compile.cuberite.org)"\n\nOr using wget:\n\n    sh -c "$(wget -O - https://compile.cuberite.org)"\n\n### Hosted services\n\n- Hosted Cuberite is available via [Gamocosm][5].\n\n## Contributing\n\nCuberite is licensed under the Apache License V2, and we welcome anybody to fork and submit a Pull Request back with their changes, and if you want to join as a permanent member we can add you to the team.\n\nCuberite is developed in C++ and Lua.
