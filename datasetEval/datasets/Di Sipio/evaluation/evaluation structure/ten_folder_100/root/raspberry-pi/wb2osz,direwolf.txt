Those days are gone.  You can now get better results at lower cost by connecting your radio to the \xe2\x80\x9csoundcard\xe2\x80\x9d interface of a computer and using software to decode the signals.\n\nWhy settle for mediocre receive performance from a 1980\'s technology  TNC using an old modem chip?   Dire Wolf decodes over 1000 error-free frames from Track 2 of the [WA8LMF TNC Test CD](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/tree/dev/doc/WA8LMF-TNC-Test-CD-Results.pdf), leaving all the hardware TNCs, and first generation "soundcard" modems, behind in the dust.\n\n![](tnc-test-cd-results.png)\n\n \nDire Wolf is a modern software replacement for the old 1980\'s style TNC built with special hardware.\n\nWithout any additional software, it can perform as:\n\n - APRS GPS Tracker\n - Digipeater\n - Internet Gateway (IGate)\n- [APRStt](http://www.aprs.org/aprstt.html) gateway\n\n\nIt can also be used as a virtual TNC for other applications such as [APRSIS32](http://aprsisce.wikidot.com/), [UI-View32](http://www.ui-view.net/), [Xastir](http://xastir.org/index.php/Main_Page), [APRS-TW](http://aprstw.blandranch.net/), [YAAC](http://www.ka2ddo.org/ka2ddo/YAAC.html), [UISS](http://users.belgacom.net/hamradio/uiss.htm), [Linux AX25](http://www.linux-ax25.org/wiki/Main_Page), [SARTrack](http://www.sartrack.co.nz/index.html), [Winlink Express (formerly known as RMS Express, formerly known as Winlink 2000 or WL2K)](http://www.winlink.org/RMSExpress), [BPQ32](http://www.cantab.net/users/john.wiseman/Documents/BPQ32.html), [Outpost PM](http://www.outpostpm.org/), and many others.\n \n \n## Features & Benefits ##\n\n![](direwolf-block-diagram.png)\n\n### Dire Wolf includes: ###\n\n\n\n- **Beaconing, Tracker, Telemetry Toolkit.**\n\n     Send periodic beacons to provide information to others.  For tracking the location is provided by a GPS receiver.\n     Build your own telemetry applications with the toolkit.\n\n\n- **APRStt Gateway.**\n\n     Very few hams have portable equipment for APRS but nearly everyone has a handheld radio that can send DTMF tones.  APRStt allows a user, equipped with only DTMF (commonly known as Touch Tone) generation capability, to enter information into the global APRS data network.  Responses can be sent by Morse Code or synthesized speech.\n\n- **Digipeaters for APRS and traditional Packet Radio.**\n\n    Extend the range of other stations by re-transmitting their signals. Unmatched flexibility for cross band repeating and filtering to limit what is retransmitted.\n\n- **Internet Gateway (IGate).**\n\n    IGate stations allow communication between disjoint radio networks by allowing some content to flow between them over the Internet.\n\n\n- **AX.25 v2.2 Link Layer.**\n\n    Traditional connected mode packet radio where the TNC automatically retries transmissions and delivers data in the right order.\n\n- **KISS Interface (TCP/IP, serial port, Bluetooth) & AGW network Interface (TCP/IP).**\n\n    Dire Wolf can be used as a virtual TNC for applications such as   APRSIS32,           UI-View32, Xastir, APRS-TW,YAAC, UISS, Linux  AX25, SARTrack, Winlink / RMS Express, Outpost PM, and many others.  \n\n### Radio Interfaces:   ###\n\n- **Uses computer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csoundcard\xe2\x80\x9d and digital signal processing.**\n\n    Lower cost and better performance than specialized hardware. \n\n    Compatible interfaces include [UDRC](https://nw-digital-radio.groups.io/g/udrc/wiki/UDRC%E2%84%A2-and-Direwolf-Packet-Modem), [SignaLink USB](http://www.tigertronics.com/slusbmain.htm), [DMK URI](http://www.dmkeng.com/URI_Order_Page.htm), [RB-USB RIM](http://www.repeater-builder.com/products/usb-rim-lite.html), [RA-35](http://www.masterscommunications.com/products/radio-adapter/ra35.html), and many others.\n\n\n\n- **Standard 300, 1200 & 9600 bps modems and more.**\n\n- **DTMF (\xe2\x80\x9cTouch Tone\xe2\x80\x9d) Decoding and Encoding.**\n \n- **Speech Synthesizer & Morse code generator.**\n\n    Transmit human understandable messages.\n\n- **Compatible with Software Defined Radios such as gqrx, rtl_fm, and SDR#.**\n\n- **Concurrent operation with up to 3 soundcards and 6 radios.**\n\n### Portable & Open Source:   ###\n\n- **Runs on Windows, Linux (PC/laptop, Raspberry Pi, etc.), Mac OSX.**\n\n\n\n## Documentation ##\n\n[Stable Version](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/tree/master/doc)\n\n[Latest Development Version](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/tree/dev/doc)\n\n[Power Point presentation](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf-presentation)  -- Why not give a talk at a local club meeting?\n\n\n## Installation ##\n\n### Windows ###\n\nGo to the [**releases** page](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/releases).   Download a zip file with "win" in its name, unzip it, and run direwolf.exe from a command window.\n\nFor more details see the **User Guide** in the [**doc** directory](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/tree/master/doc).  \n\n\n\n\n### Linux - Using git clone (recommended) ###\n\n\tcd ~\n\tgit clone https://www.github.com/wb2osz/direwolf\n\tcd direwolf\n\tmake\n\tsudo make install\n\tmake install-conf\n\nThis should give you the most recent stable release.  If you want the latest (possibly unstable) development version, use "git checkout dev" before the first "make" command.\n\nFor more details see the **User Guide** in the [**doc** directory](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/tree/master/doc).  Special considerations for the Raspberry Pi are found in **Raspberry-Pi-APRS.pdf**\n\n\n### Linux - Using apt-get (Debian flavor operating systems) ###\n\nResults will vary depending on your hardware platform and operating system version because it depends on various volunteers who perform the packaging.  \n\n\tsudo apt-get update\n    apt-cache showpkg direwolf\n\tsudo apt-get install direwolf\n\n\n### Linux - Using yum (Red Hat flavor operating systems) ###\n\nResults will vary depending on your hardware platform and operating system version because it depends on various volunteers who perform the packaging.  \n\n\tsudo yum check-update\n    sudo yum list direwolf\n\tsudo yum install direwolf\n\n### Linux - Download source in tar or zip file ###\n\nGo to the [releases page](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/releases).  Chose desired release and download the source as zip or compressed tar file.  Unpack the files, with "unzip" or "tar xfz," and then:\n\n\tcd direwolf-*\n\tmake\n\tsudo make install\n\tmake install-conf\n\nFor more details see the **User Guide** in the [**doc** directory](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/tree/master/doc).  Special considerations for the Raspberry Pi are found in **Raspberry-Pi-APRS.pdf**\n\n\n### Macintosh OS X ###\n\nRead the **User Guide** in the [**doc** directory](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/tree/master/doc).   It is a lot more complicated than Linux.  \n\nIf you have problems,  post them to the [Dire Wolf packet TNC](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/direwolf_packet/info) discussion group.   I don\'t have a Mac and probably won\'t be able to help you.  I rely on others, in the user community, for the Mac version.\n\n\n\n## Join the conversation  ##\n \nHere are some good places to ask questions and share your experience:\n\n- [Dire Wolf packet TNC](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/direwolf_packet/info) \n\n- [Raspberry Pi 4 Ham Radio](https://groups.io/g/RaspberryPi-4-HamRadio)\n\n- [linuxham](https://groups.io/g/linuxham)\n\n- [TAPR aprssig](http://www.tapr.org/pipermail/aprssig/)\n \n\nThe github "issues" section is for reporting software defects and enhancement requests.
