Gitrob will clone repositories belonging to a user or organization down to a configurable depth and iterate through the commit history and flag files that match signatures for potentially sensitive files. The findings will be presented through a web interface for easy browsing and analysis.\n\n## Usage\n\n    gitrob [options] target [target2] ... [targetN]\n\n### Options\n\n```\n-bind-address string\n    Address to bind web server to (default "127.0.0.1")\n-commit-depth int\n    Number of repository commits to process (default 500)\n-debug\n    Print debugging information\n-github-access-token string\n    GitHub access token to use for API requests\n-load string\n    Load session file\n-no-expand-orgs\n    Don\'t add members to targets when processing organizations\n-port int\n    Port to run web server on (default 9393)\n-save string\n    Save session to file\n-silent\n    Suppress all output except for errors\n-threads int\n    Number of concurrent threads (default number of logical CPUs)\n```\n\n### Saving session to a file\n\nBy default, gitrob will store its state for an assessment in memory. This means that the results of an assessment is lost when Gitrob is closed. You can save the session to a file by using the `-save` option:\n\n    gitrob -save ~/gitrob-session.json acmecorp\n\nGitrob will save all the gathered information to the specified file path as a special JSON document. The file can be loaded again for browsing at another point in time, shared with other analysts or parsed for custom integrations with other tools and systems.\n\n### Loading session from a file\n\nA session stored in a file can be loaded with the `-load` option:\n\n    gitrob -load ~/gitrob-session.json\n\nGitrob will start its web interface and serve the results for analysis.\n\n## Installation\n\nA [precompiled version is available](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob/releases) for each release, alternatively you can use the latest version of the source code from this repository in order to build your own binary.\n\nMake sure you have a correctly configured **Go >= 1.8** environment and that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`\n\n    $ go get github.com/michenriksen/gitrob\n\nThis command will download gitrob, install its dependencies, compile it and move the `gitrob` executable to `$GOPATH/bin`.\n\n### Github access token\n\nGitrob will need a Github access token in order to interact with the Github API.  [Create a personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) and save it in an environment variable in your `.bashrc` or similar shell configuration file:\n\n    export GITROB_ACCESS_TOKEN=deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef\n\nAlternatively you can specify the access token with the `-github-access-token` option, but watch out for your command history!\n'
