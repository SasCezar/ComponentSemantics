For example, the plugins will be checked passively but their version with a mixed detection mode (passively + aggressively). Potential config backup files will also be checked, along with other interesting findings.\n\nIf a more stealthy approach is required, then ```wpscan --stealthy --url blog.tld``` can be used.\nAs a result, when using the ```--enumerate``` option, don\'t forget to set the ```--plugins-detection``` accordingly, as its default is \'passive\'.\n\nFor more options, open a terminal and type ```wpscan --help``` (if you built wpscan from the source, you should type the command outside of the git repo)\n\nThe DB is located at ~/.wpscan/db\n\n## Vulnerability Database\n\nThe WPScan CLI tool uses the [WPVulnDB API](https://wpvulndb.com/api) to retrieve WordPress vulnerability data in real time. For WPScan to retrieve the vulnerability data an API token must be supplied via the `--api-token` option, or via a configuration file, as discussed below. An API token can be obtained by registering an account on [WPVulnDB](https://wpvulndb.com/users/sign_up). Up to 50 API requests per day are given free of charge to registered users. Once the 50 API requests are exhausted, WPScan will continue to work as normal but without any vulnerability data. Users can upgrade to paid API usage to increase their API limits within their user profile on [WPVulnDB](https://wpvulndb.com/).\n\n## Load CLI options from file/s\n\nWPScan can load all options (including the --url) from configuration files, the following locations are checked (order: first to last):\n\n- ~/.wpscan/scan.json\n- ~/.wpscan/scan.yml\n- pwd/.wpscan/scan.json\n- pwd/.wpscan/scan.yml\n\nIf those files exist, options from the `cli_options` key will be loaded and overridden if found twice.\n\ne.g:\n\n~/.wpscan/scan.yml:\n\n```yml\ncli_options:\n  proxy: \'http://127.0.0.1:8080\'\n  verbose: true\n```\n\npwd/.wpscan/scan.yml:\n\n```yml\ncli_options:\n  proxy: \'socks5://127.0.0.1:9090\'\n  url: \'http://target.tld\'\n```\n\nRunning ```wpscan``` in the current directory (pwd), is the same as ```wpscan -v --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9090 --url http://target.tld```\n\n## Save API Token in a file\n\nThe feature mentioned above is useful to keep the API Token in a config file and not have to supply it via the CLI each time. To do so, create the ~/.wpscan/scan.yml file containing the below:\n\n```yml\ncli_options:\n  api_token: YOUR_API_TOKEN\n```\n\n## Enumerating usernames\n\n```shell\nwpscan --url https://target.tld/ --enumerate u\n```\n\nEnumerating a range of usernames\n\n```shell\nwpscan --url https://target.tld/ --enumerate u1-100\n```\n\n** replace u1-100 with a range of your choice.\n\n# LICENSE\n\n## WPScan Public Source License\n\nThe WPScan software (henceforth referred to simply as "WPScan") is dual-licensed - Copyright 2011-2019 WPScan Team.\n\nCases that include commercialization of WPScan require a commercial, non-free license.
