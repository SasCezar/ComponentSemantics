b'SOPS: Secrets OPerationS\n========================\n\n**sops** is an editor of encrypted files that supports YAML, JSON, ENV, INI and BINARY\nformats and encrypts with AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault and PGP.\n(`demo <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTEVyLXFiq0>`_)\n\n.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/X0TM5NI.gif\n\n------------\n\n.. image:: https://godoc.org/go.mozilla.org/sops?status.svg\n\t:target: https://godoc.org/go.mozilla.org/sops\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/sops.svg?branch=master\n\t:target: https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/sops\n\nDownload\n--------\n\nStable release\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBinaries and packages of the latest stable release are available at `https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases <https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases>`_.\n\nDevelopment branch\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFor the adventurous, unstable features are available in the `develop` branch, which you can install from source:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ go get -u go.mozilla.org/sops/v3/cmd/sops\n        $ cd $GOPATH/src/go.mozilla.org/sops/\n        $ git checkout develop\n        $ make install\n\n(requires Go >= 1.13)\n\nIf you don\'t have Go installed, set it up with:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ {apt,yum,brew} install golang\n\t$ echo \'export GOPATH=~/go\' >> ~/.bashrc\n\t$ source ~/.bashrc\n\t$ mkdir $GOPATH\n\nOr whatever variation of the above fits your system and shell.\n\nTo use **sops** as a library, take a look at the `decrypt package <https://godoc.org/go.mozilla.org/sops/decrypt>`_.\n\n**Questions?** ping "ulfr" and "autrilla" in ``#security`` on `irc.mozilla.org <https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC>`_\n(use a web client like `mibbit <https://chat.mibbit.com>`_ ).\n\n**What happened to Python Sops?** We rewrote Sops in Go to solve a number of\ndeployment issues, but the Python branch still exists under ``python-sops``. We\nwill keep maintaining it for a while, and you can still ``pip install sops``,\nbut we strongly recommend you use the Go version instead.\n\n.. sectnum::\n.. contents:: Table of Contents\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor a quick presentation of Sops, check out this Youtube tutorial:\n\n.. image:: https://img.youtube.com/vi/V2PRhxphH2w/0.jpg\n   :target: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2PRhxphH2w\n\nIf you\'re using AWS KMS, create one or multiple master keys in the IAM console\nand export them, comma separated, in the **SOPS_KMS_ARN** env variable. It is\nrecommended to use at least two master keys in different regions.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\texport SOPS_KMS_ARN="arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:656532927350:key/920aff2e-c5f1-4040-943a-047fa387b27e,arn:aws:kms:ap-southeast-1:656532927350:key/9006a8aa-0fa6-4c14-930e-a2dfb916de1d"\n\nYour AWS credentials must be present in ``~/.aws/credentials``. sops uses aws-sdk-go.\n\n.. code::\n\n\t$ cat ~/.aws/credentials\n\t[default]\n\taws_access_key_id = AKI.....\n\taws_secret_access_key = mw......\n\nIf you want to use PGP, export the fingerprints of the public keys, comma\nseparated, in the **SOPS_PGP_FP** env variable.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\texport SOPS_PGP_FP="85D77543B3D624B63CEA9E6DBC17301B491B3F21,E60892BB9BD89A69F759A1A0A3D652173B763E8F"\n\nNote: you can use both PGP and KMS simultaneously.\n\nThen simply call ``sops`` with a file path as argument. It will handle the\nencryption/decryption transparently and open the cleartext file in an editor\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n\t$ sops mynewtestfile.yaml\n\tmynewtestfile.yaml doesn\'t exist, creating it.\n\tplease wait while an encryption key is being generated and stored in a secure fashion\n\tfile written to mynewtestfile.yaml\n\nEditing will happen in whatever ``$EDITOR`` is set to, or, if it\'s not set, in vim.\nKeep in mind that sops will wait for the editor to exit, and then try to reencrypt\nthe file. Some GUI editors (atom, sublime) spawn a child process and then exit\nimmediately. They usually have an option to wait for the main editor window to be\nclosed before exiting. See `#127 <https://github.com/mozilla/sops/issues/127>`_ for\nmore information.\n\nThe resulting encrypted file looks like this:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    myapp1: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:Tr7o=,iv:1=,aad:No=,tag:k=]\n    app2:\n        db:\n            user: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:CwE4O1s=,iv:2k=,aad:o=,tag:w==]\n            password: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:p673w==,iv:YY=,aad:UQ=,tag:A=]\n        # private key for secret operations in app2\n        key: |-\n            ENC[AES256_GCM,data:Ea3kL5O5U8=,iv:DM=,aad:FKA=,tag:EA==]\n    an_array:\n    - ENC[AES256_GCM,data:v8jQ=,iv:HBE=,aad:21c=,tag:gA==]\n    - ENC[AES256_GCM,data:X10=,iv:o8=,aad:CQ=,tag:Hw==]\n    - ENC[AES256_GCM,data:KN=,iv:160=,aad:fI4=,tag:tNw==]\n    sops:\n        kms:\n        -   created_at: 1441570389.775376\n            enc: CiC....Pm1Hm\n            arn: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:656532927350:key/920aff2e-c5f1-4040-943a-047fa387b27e\n        -   created_at: 1441570391.925734\n            enc: Ci...awNx\n            arn: arn:aws:kms:ap-southeast-1:656532927350:key/9006a8aa-0fa6-4c14-930e-a2dfb916de1d\n        pgp:\n        -   fp: 85D77543B3D624B63CEA9E6DBC17301B491B3F21\n            created_at: 1441570391.930042\n            enc: |\n                -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\n                hQIMA0t4uZHfl9qgAQ//UvGAwGePyHuf2/zayWcloGaDs0MzI+zw6CmXvMRNPUsA\n\t\t\t\t...=oJgS\n                -----END PGP MESSAGE-----\n\nA copy of the encryption/decryption key is stored securely in each KMS and PGP\nblock. As long as one of the KMS or PGP method is still usable, you will be able\nto access your data.\n\nTo decrypt a file in a ``cat`` fashion, use the ``-d`` flag:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops -d mynewtestfile.yaml\n\n``sops`` encrypted files contain the necessary information to decrypt their content.\nAll a user of ``sops`` needs is valid AWS credentials and the necessary\npermissions on KMS keys.\n\nGiven that, the only command a ``sops`` user needs is:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops <file>\n\n`<file>` will be opened, decrypted, passed to a text editor (vim by default),\nencrypted if modified, and saved back to its original location. All of these\nsteps, apart from the actual editing, are transparent to the user.\n\nTest with the dev PGP key\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you want to test **sops** without having to do a bunch of setup, you can use\nthe example files and pgp key provided with the repository::\n\n\t$ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/sops.git\n\t$ cd sops\n\t$ gpg --import pgp/sops_functional_tests_key.asc\n\t$ sops example.yaml\n\nThis last step will decrypt ``example.yaml`` using the test private key.\n\n\nEncrypting using GCP KMS\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGCP KMS uses `Application Default Credentials\n<https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials>`_.\nIf you already logged in using\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ gcloud auth login\n\nyou can enable application default credentials using the sdk::\n\n\t$ gcloud auth application-default login\n\nEncrypting/decrypting with GCP KMS requires a KMS ResourceID. You can use the\ncloud console the get the ResourceID or you can create one using the gcloud\nsdk:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ gcloud kms keyrings create sops --location global\n\t$ gcloud kms keys create sops-key --location global --keyring sops --purpose encryption\n\t$ gcloud kms keys list --location global --keyring sops\n\n\t# you should see\n\tNAME                                                                   PURPOSE          PRIMARY_STATE\n\tprojects/my-project/locations/global/keyRings/sops/cryptoKeys/sops-key ENCRYPT_DECRYPT  ENABLED\n\nNow you can encrypt a file using::\n\n\t$ sops --encrypt --gcp-kms projects/my-project/locations/global/keyRings/sops/cryptoKeys/sops-key test.yaml > test.enc.yaml\n\nAnd decrypt it using::\n\n\t $ sops --decrypt test.enc.yaml\n\nEncrypting using Azure Key Vault\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Azure Key Vault integration tries several authentication methods, in\nthis order:\n\n  1. Client credentials\n  2. Client Certificate\n  3. Username Password\n  4. MSI\n  5. Azure CLI auth\n\nYou can force a specific authentication method through the AZURE_AUTH_METHOD\nenvironment variable, which may be one of: clientcredentials, clientcertificate,\nusernamepassword, msi, or cli (default).\n\nFor example, you can use service principals with the following environment variables:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\tAZURE_TENANT_ID\n\tAZURE_CLIENT_ID\n\tAZURE_CLIENT_SECRET\n\nYou can create a service principal using the cli like this:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ az ad sp create-for-rbac -n my-keyvault-sp\n\n\t{\n\t\t"appId": "<some-uuid>",\n\t\t"displayName": "my-keyvault-sp",\n\t\t"name": "http://my-keyvault-sp",\n\t\t"password": "<some-uuid>",\n\t\t"tenant": "<tenant-id>"\n\t}\n\nThe appId is the client id, and the password is the client secret.\n\nEncrypting/decrypting with Azure Key Vault requires the resource identifier for\na key. This has the following form::\n\n\thttps://${VAULT_URL}/keys/${KEY_NAME}/${KEY_VERSION}\n\nTo create a Key Vault and assign your service principal permissions on it\nfrom the commandline:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t# Create a resource group if you do not have one:\n\t$ az group create --name sops-rg --location westeurope\n\t# Key Vault names are globally unique, so generate one:\n\t$ keyvault_name=sops-$(uuidgen | tr -d - | head -c 16)\n\t# Create a Vault, a key, and give the service principal access:\n\t$ az keyvault create --name $keyvault_name --resource-group sops-rg --location westeurope\n\t$ az keyvault key create --name sops-key --vault-name $keyvault_name --protection software --ops encrypt decrypt\n\t$ az keyvault set-policy --name $keyvault_name --resource-group sops-rg --spn $AZURE_CLIENT_ID \\\n\t\t--key-permissions encrypt decrypt\n\t# Read the key id:\n\t$ az keyvault key show --name sops-key --vault-name $keyvault_name --query key.kid\n\n\thttps://sops.vault.azure.net/keys/sops-key/some-string\n\nNow you can encrypt a file using::\n\n\t$ sops --encrypt --azure-kv https://sops.vault.azure.net/keys/sops-key/some-string test.yaml > test.enc.yaml\n\nAnd decrypt it using::\n\n\t $ sops --decrypt test.enc.yaml\n\n\nAdding and removing keys\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhen creating new files, ``sops`` uses the PGP, KMS and GCP KMS defined in the\ncommand line arguments ``--kms``, ``--pgp``, ``--gcp-kms`` or ``--azure-kv``, or from\nthe environment variables ``SOPS_KMS_ARN``, ``SOPS_PGP_FP``, ``SOPS_GCP_KMS_IDS``,\n``SOPS_AZURE_KEYVAULT_URLS``. That information is stored in the file under the\n``sops`` section, such that decrypting files does not require providing those\nparameters again.\n\nMaster PGP and KMS keys can be added and removed from a ``sops`` file in one of\nthree ways::\n\n1. By using a .sops.yaml file and the ``updatekeys`` command.\n\n2. By using command line flags.\n\n3. By editing the file directly.\n\nThe sops team recommends the ``updatekeys`` approach.\n\n\n``updatekeys`` command\n**********************\n\nThe ``updatekeys`` command uses the `.sops.yaml <#29using-sopsyaml-conf-to-select-kmspgp-for-new-files>`_\nconfiguration file to update (add or remove) the corresponding secrets in the\nencrypted file. Note that the example below uses the\n`Block Scalar yaml construct <https://yaml-multiline.info/>`_ to build a space\nseparated list.\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    creation_rules:\n        - pgp: >-\n            85D77543B3D624B63CEA9E6DBC17301B491B3F21,\n            FBC7B9E2A4F9289AC0C1D4843D16CEE4A27381B4\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops updatekeys test.enc.yaml\n\nSops will prompt you with the changes to be made. This interactivity can be\ndisabled by supplying the ``-y`` flag.\n\nCommand Line\n************\n\nCommand line flag ``--add-kms``, ``--add-pgp``, ``--add-gcp-kms``, ``--add-azure-kv``,\n``--rm-kms``, ``--rm-pgp``, ``--rm-gcp-kms`` and ``--rm-azure-kv`` can be used to add\nand remove keys from a file.\nThese flags use the comma separated syntax as the ``--kms``, ``--pgp``, ``--gcp-kms``\nand ``--azure-kv`` arguments when creating new files.\n\nNote that ``-r`` or ``--rotate`` is mandatory in this mode. Not specifying\nrotate will ignore the ``--add-*`` options. Use ``updatekeys`` if you want to\nadd a key without rotating the data key.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t# add a new pgp key to the file and rotate the data key\n\t$ sops -r -i --add-pgp 85D77543B3D624B63CEA9E6DBC17301B491B3F21 example.yaml\n\n\t# remove a pgp key from the file and rotate the data key\n\t$ sops -r -i --rm-pgp 85D77543B3D624B63CEA9E6DBC17301B491B3F21 example.yaml\n\n\nDirect Editing\n**************\n\nAlternatively, invoking ``sops`` with the flag **-s** will display the master keys\nwhile editing. This method can be used to add or remove kms or pgp keys under the\nsops section. Invoking ``sops`` with the **-i** flag will perform an in-place edit\ninstead of redirecting output to ``stdout``.\n\nFor example, to add a KMS master key to a file, add the following entry while\nediting:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n\tsops:\n\t    kms:\n\t    - arn: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:656532927350:key/920aff2e-c5f1-4040-943a-047fa387b27e\n\nAnd, similarly, to add a PGP master key, we add its fingerprint:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n\tsops:\n\t    pgp:\n\t    - fp: 85D77543B3D624B63CEA9E6DBC17301B491B3F21\n\nWhen the file is saved, ``sops`` will update its metadata and encrypt the data key\nwith the freshly added master keys. The removed entries are simply deleted from\nthe file.\n\nWhen removing keys, it is recommended to rotate the data key using ``-r``,\notherwise owners of the removed key may have add access to the data key in the\npast.\n\nKMS AWS Profiles\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you want to use a specific profile, you can do so with `aws_profile`:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n\tsops:\n\t    kms:\n\t    -\tarn: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:656532927350:key/920aff2e-c5f1-4040-943a-047fa387b27e\n\t        aws_profile: foo\n\nIf no AWS profile is set, default credentials will be used.\n\nSimilarly the `--aws-profile` flag can be set with the command line with any of the KMS commands.\n\n\nAssuming roles and using KMS in various AWS accounts\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSOPS has the ability to use KMS in multiple AWS accounts by assuming roles in\neach account. Being able to assume roles is a nice feature of AWS that allows\nadministrators to establish trust relationships between accounts, typically from\nthe most secure account to the least secure one. In our use-case, we use roles\nto indicate that a user of the Master AWS account is allowed to make use of KMS\nmaster keys in development and staging AWS accounts. Using roles, a single file\ncan be encrypted with KMS keys in multiple accounts, thus increasing reliability\nand ease of use.\n\nYou can use keys in various accounts by tying each KMS master key to a role that\nthe user is allowed to assume in each account. The `IAM roles\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html>`_\ndocumentation has full details on how this needs to be configured on AWS\'s side.\n\nFrom the point of view of ``sops``, you only need to specify the role a KMS key\nmust assume alongside its ARN, as follows:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n\tsops:\n\t    kms:\n\t    -\tarn: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:656532927350:key/920aff2e-c5f1-4040-943a-047fa387b27e\n\t        role: arn:aws:iam::927034868273:role/sops-dev-xyz\n\nThe role must have permission to call Encrypt and Decrypt using KMS. An example\npolicy is shown below.\n\n.. code:: json\n\n\t{\n\t  "Sid": "Allow use of the key",\n\t  "Effect": "Allow",\n\t  "Action": [\n\t\t"kms:Encrypt",\n\t\t"kms:Decrypt",\n\t\t"kms:ReEncrypt*",\n\t\t"kms:GenerateDataKey*",\n\t\t"kms:DescribeKey"\n\t  ],\n\t  "Resource": "*",\n\t  "Principal": {\n\t\t"AWS": [\n\t\t  "arn:aws:iam::927034868273:role/sops-dev-xyz"\n\t\t]\n\t  }\n\t}\n\nYou can specify a role in the ``--kms`` flag and ``SOPS_KMS_ARN`` variable by\nappending it to the ARN of the master key, separated by a **+** sign::\n\n\t<KMS ARN>+<ROLE ARN>\n\tarn:aws:kms:us-west-2:927034868273:key/fe86dd69-4132-404c-ab86-4269956b4500+arn:aws:iam::927034868273:role/sops-dev-xyz\n\nAWS KMS Encryption Context\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSOPS has the ability to use `AWS KMS key policy and encryption context\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/encryption-context.html>`_\nto refine the access control of a given KMS master key.\n\nWhen creating a new file, you can specify encryption context in the\n``--encryption-context`` flag by comma separated list of key-value pairs:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops --encryption-context Environment:production,Role:web-server test.dev.yaml\n\nThe format of the Encrypt Context string is ``<EncryptionContext Key>:<EncryptionContext Value>,<EncryptionContext Key>:<EncryptionContext Value>,...``\n\nThe encryption context will be stored in the file metadata and does\nnot need to be provided at decryption.\n\nEncryption contexts can be used in conjunction with KMS Key Policies to define\nroles that can only access a given context. An example policy is shown below:\n\n.. code:: json\n\n    {\n      "Effect": "Allow",\n      "Principal": {\n        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/RoleForExampleApp"\n      },\n      "Action": "kms:Decrypt",\n      "Resource": "*",\n      "Condition": {\n        "StringEquals": {\n          "kms:EncryptionContext:AppName": "ExampleApp",\n          "kms:EncryptionContext:FilePath": "/var/opt/secrets/"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nKey Rotation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt is recommended to renew the data key on a regular basis. ``sops`` supports key\nrotation via the ``-r`` flag. Invoking it on an existing file causes sops to\nreencrypt the file with a new data key, which is then encrypted with the various\nKMS and PGP master keys defined in the file.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\tsops -r example.yaml\n\nUsing .sops.yaml conf to select KMS/PGP for new files\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt is often tedious to specify the ``--kms`` ``--gcp-kms`` and ``--pgp`` parameters for creation\nof all new files. If your secrets are stored under a specific directory, like a\n``git`` repository, you can create a ``.sops.yaml`` configuration file at the root\ndirectory to define which keys are used for which filename.\n\nLet\'s take an example:\n\n* file named **something.dev.yaml** should use one set of KMS A\n* file named **something.prod.yaml** should use another set of KMS B\n* other files use a third set of KMS C\n* all live under **mysecretrepo/something.{dev,prod,gcp}.yaml**\n\nUnder those circumstances, a file placed at **mysecretrepo/.sops.yaml**\ncan manage the three sets of configurations for the three types of files:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n\t# creation rules are evaluated sequentially, the first match wins\n\tcreation_rules:\n\t\t# upon creation of a file that matches the pattern *.dev.yaml,\n\t\t# KMS set A is used\n\t\t- path_regex: \\.dev\\.yaml$\n\t\t  kms: \'arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:927034868273:key/fe86dd69-4132-404c-ab86-4269956b4500,arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:361527076523:key/5052f06a-5d3f-489e-b86c-57201e06f31e+arn:aws:iam::361527076523:role/hiera-sops-prod\'\n\t\t  pgp: \'FBC7B9E2A4F9289AC0C1D4843D16CEE4A27381B4\'\n\n\t\t# prod files use KMS set B in the PROD IAM\n\t\t- path_regex: \\.prod\\.yaml$\n\t\t  kms: \'arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:361527076523:key/5052f06a-5d3f-489e-b86c-57201e06f31e+arn:aws:iam::361527076523:role/hiera-sops-prod,arn:aws:kms:eu-central-1:361527076523:key/cb1fab90-8d17-42a1-a9d8-334968904f94+arn:aws:iam::361527076523:role/hiera-sops-prod\'\n\t\t  pgp: \'FBC7B9E2A4F9289AC0C1D4843D16CEE4A27381B4\'\n\n\t\t# gcp files using GCP KMS\n\t\t- path_regex: \\.gcp\\.yaml$\n\t\t  gcp_kms: projects/mygcproject/locations/global/keyRings/mykeyring/cryptoKeys/thekey\n\n\t\t# Finally, if the rules above have not matched, this one is a\n\t\t# catchall that will encrypt the file using KMS set C\n\t\t# The absence of a path_regex means it will match everything\n\t\t- kms: \'arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:927034868273:key/fe86dd69-4132-404c-ab86-4269956b4500,arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:142069644989:key/846cfb17-373d-49b9-8baf-f36b04512e47,arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:361527076523:key/5052f06a-5d3f-489e-b86c-57201e06f31e\'\n\t\t  pgp: \'FBC7B9E2A4F9289AC0C1D4843D16CEE4A27381B4\'\n\nWhen creating any file under **mysecretrepo**, whether at the root or under\na subdirectory, sops will recursively look for a ``.sops.yaml`` file. If one is\nfound, the filename of the file being created is compared with the filename\nregexes of the configuration file. The first regex that matches is selected,\nand its KMS and PGP keys are used to encrypt the file. It should be noted that\nthe looking up of ``.sops.yaml`` is from the working directory (CWD) instead of\nthe directory of the encrypting file (see `Issue 242 <https://github.com/mozilla/sops/issues/242>`_).\n\nThe path_regex checks the full path of the encrypting file. Here is another example:\n\n* files located under directory **development** should use one set of KMS A\n* files located under directory **production** should use another set of KMS B\n* other files use a third set of KMS C\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    creation_rules:\n        # upon creation of a file under development,\n        # KMS set A is used\n        - path_regex: .*/development/.*\n          kms: \'arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:927034868273:key/fe86dd69-4132-404c-ab86-4269956b4500,arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:361527076523:key/5052f06a-5d3f-489e-b86c-57201e06f31e+arn:aws:iam::361527076523:role/hiera-sops-prod\'\n          pgp: \'FBC7B9E2A4F9289AC0C1D4843D16CEE4A27381B4\'\n\n        # prod files use KMS set B in the PROD IAM\n        - path_regex: .*/production/.*\n          kms: \'arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:361527076523:key/5052f06a-5d3f-489e-b86c-57201e06f31e+arn:aws:iam::361527076523:role/hiera-sops-prod,arn:aws:kms:eu-central-1:361527076523:key/cb1fab90-8d17-42a1-a9d8-334968904f94+arn:aws:iam::361527076523:role/hiera-sops-prod\'\n          pgp: \'FBC7B9E2A4F9289AC0C1D4843D16CEE4A27381B4\'\n\n        # other files use KMS set C\n        - kms: \'arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:927034868273:key/fe86dd69-4132-404c-ab86-4269956b4500,arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:142069644989:key/846cfb17-373d-49b9-8baf-f36b04512e47,arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:361527076523:key/5052f06a-5d3f-489e-b86c-57201e06f31e\'\n          pgp: \'FBC7B9E2A4F9289AC0C1D4843D16CEE4A27381B4\'\n\nCreating a new file with the right keys is now as simple as\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops <newfile>.prod.yaml\n\nNote that the configuration file is ignored when KMS or PGP parameters are\npassed on the sops command line or in environment variables.\n\nSpecify a different GPG executable\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``sops`` checks for the ``SOPS_GPG_EXEC`` environment variable. If specified,\nit will attempt to use the executable set there instead of the default\nof ``gpg``.\n\nExample: place the following in your ``~/.bashrc``\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\tSOPS_GPG_EXEC = \'your_gpg_client_wrapper\'\n\n\nSpecify a different GPG key server\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBy default, ``sops`` uses the key server ``gpg.mozilla.org`` to retrieve the GPG\nkeys that are not present in the local keyring.\nTo use a different GPG key server, set the ``SOPS_GPG_KEYSERVER`` environment\nvariable.\n\nExample: place the following in your ``~/.bashrc``\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\tSOPS_GPG_KEYSERVER = \'gpg.example.com\'\n\n\nKey groups\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBy default, ``sops`` encrypts the data key for a file with each of the master keys,\nsuch that if any of the master keys is available, the file can be decrypted.\nHowever, it is sometimes desirable to require access to multiple master keys\nin order to decrypt files. This can be achieved with key groups.\n\nWhen using key groups in sops, data keys are split into parts such that keys from\nmultiple groups are required to decrypt a file. ``sops`` uses Shamir\'s Secret Sharing\nto split the data key such that each key group has a fragment, each key in the\nkey group can decrypt that fragment, and a configurable number of fragments (threshold)\nare needed to decrypt and piece together the complete data key. When decrypting a\nfile using multiple key groups, ``sops`` goes through key groups in order, and in\neach group, tries to recover the fragment of the data key using a master key from\nthat group. Once the fragment is recovered, ``sops`` moves on to the next group,\nuntil enough fragments have been recovered to obtain the complete data key.\n\nBy default, the threshold is set to the number of key groups. For example, if\nyou have three key groups configured in your SOPS file and you don\'t override\nthe default threshold, then one master key from each of the three groups will\nbe required to decrypt the file.\n\nManagement of key groups is done with the ``sops groups`` command.\n\nFor example, you can add a new key group with 3 PGP keys and 3 KMS keys to the\nfile ``my_file.yaml``:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ sops groups add --file my_file.yaml --pgp fingerprint1 --pgp fingerprint2 --pgp fingerprint3 --kms arn1 --kms arn2 --kms arn3\n\nOr you can delete the 1st group (group number 0, as groups are zero-indexed)\nfrom ``my_file.yaml``:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ sops groups delete --file my_file.yaml 0\n\nKey groups can also be specified in the ``.sops.yaml`` config file,\nlike so:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    creation_rules:\n        - path_regex: .*keygroups.*\n          key_groups:\n          # First key group\n          - pgp:\n            - fingerprint1\n            - fingerprint2\n            kms:\n            - arn: arn1\n              role: role1\n              context:\n                foo: bar\n            - arn: arn2\n          # Second key group\n          - pgp:\n            - fingerprint3\n            - fingerprint4\n            kms:\n            - arn: arn3\n            - arn: arn4\n          # Third key group\n          - pgp:\n            - fingerprint5\n\nGiven this configuration, we can create a new encrypted file like we normally\nwould, and optionally provide the ``--shamir-secret-sharing-threshold`` command line\nflag if we want to override the default threshold. ``sops`` will then split the data\nkey into three parts (from the number of key groups) and encrypt each fragment with\nthe master keys found in each group.\n\nFor example:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ sops --shamir-secret-sharing-threshold 2 example.json\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the Shamir threshold for each creation rule in the ``.sops.yaml`` config\nwith ``shamir_threshold``:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    creation_rules:\n        - path_regex: .*keygroups.*\n          shamir_threshold: 2\n          key_groups:\n          # First key group\n          - pgp:\n            - fingerprint1\n            - fingerprint2\n            kms:\n            - arn: arn1\n              role: role1\n              context:\n                foo: bar\n            - arn: arn2\n          # Second key group\n          - pgp:\n            - fingerprint3\n            - fingerprint4\n            kms:\n            - arn: arn3\n            - arn: arn4\n          # Third key group\n          - pgp:\n            - fingerprint5\n\nAnd then run ``sops example.json``.\n\nThe threshold (``shamir_threshold``) is set to 2, so this configuration will require\nmaster keys from two of the three different key groups in order to decrypt the file.\nYou can then decrypt the file the same way as with any other SOPS file:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ sops -d example.json\n\nKey service\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThere are situations where you might want to run ``sops`` on a machine that\ndoesn\'t have direct access to encryption keys such as PGP keys. The ``sops`` key\nservice allows you to forward a socket so that ``sops`` can access encryption\nkeys stored on a remote machine. This is similar to GPG Agent, but more\nportable.\n\nSOPS uses a client-server approach to encrypting and decrypting the data\nkey. By default, SOPS runs a local key service in-process. SOPS uses a key\nservice client to send an encrypt or decrypt request to a key service, which\nthen performs the operation. The requests are sent using gRPC and Protocol\nBuffers. The requests contain an identifier for the key they should perform\nthe operation with, and the plaintext or encrypted data key. The requests do\nnot contain any cryptographic keys, public or private.\n\n**WARNING: the key service connection currently does not use any sort of\nauthentication or encryption. Therefore, it is recommended that you make sure\nthe connection is authenticated and encrypted in some other way, for example\nthrough an SSH tunnel.**\n\nWhenever we try to encrypt or decrypt a data key, SOPS will try to do so first\nwith the local key service (unless it\'s disabled), and if that fails, it will\ntry all other remote key services until one succeeds.\n\nYou can start a key service server by running ``sops keyservice``.\n\nYou can specify the key services the ``sops`` binary uses with ``--keyservice``.\nThis flag can be specified more than once, so you can use multiple key\nservices. The local key service can be disabled with\n``enable-local-keyservice=false``.\n\nFor example, to decrypt a file using both the local key service and the key\nservice exposed on the unix socket located in ``/tmp/sops.sock``, you can run:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ sops --keyservice unix:///tmp/sops.sock -d file.yaml`\n\nAnd if you only want to use the key service exposed on the unix socket located\nin ``/tmp/sops.sock`` and not the local key service, you can run:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ sops --enable-local-keyservice=false --keyservice unix:///tmp/sops.sock -d file.yaml\n\nAuditing\n~~~~~~~~\n\nSometimes, users want to be able to tell what files were accessed by whom in an\nenvironment they control. For this reason, SOPS can generate audit logs to\nrecord activity on encrypted files. When enabled, SOPS will write a log entry\ninto a pre-configured PostgreSQL database when a file is decrypted. The log\nincludes a timestamp, the username SOPS is running as, and the file that was\ndecrypted.\n\nIn order to enable auditing, you must first create the database and credentials\nusing the schema found in ``audit/schema.sql``. This schema defines the\ntables that store the audit events and a role named ``sops`` that only has\npermission to add entries to the audit event tables. The default password for\nthe role ``sops`` is ``sops``. You should change this password.\n\nOnce you have created the database, you have to tell SOPS how to connect to it.\nBecause we don\'t want users of SOPS to be able to control auditing, the audit\nconfiguration file location is not configurable, and must be at\n``/etc/sops/audit.yaml``. This file should have strict permissions such\nthat only the root user can modify it.\n\nFor example, to enable auditing to a PostgreSQL database named ``sops`` running\non localhost, using the user ``sops`` and the password ``sops``,\n``/etc/sops/audit.yaml`` should have the following contents:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    backends:\n        postgres:\n            - connection_string: "postgres://sops:sops@localhost/sops?sslmode=verify-full"\n\n\nYou can find more information on the ``connection_string`` format in the\n`PostgreSQL docs <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-connect.html#libpq-connstring>`_.\n\nUnder the ``postgres`` map entry in the above YAML is a list, so one can\nprovide more than one backend, and SOPS will log to all of them:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    backends:\n        postgres:\n            - connection_string: "postgres://sops:sops@localhost/sops?sslmode=verify-full"\n            - connection_string: "postgres://sops:sops@remotehost/sops?sslmode=verify-full"\n\nSaving Output to a File\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBy default ``sops`` just dumps all the output to the standard output. We can use the\n``--output`` flag followed by a filename to save the output to the file specified.\nBeware using both ``--in-place`` and ``--output`` flags will result in an error.\n\nPassing Secrets to Other Processes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn addition to writing secrets to standard output and to files on disk, ``sops``\nhas two commands for passing decrypted secrets to a new process: ``exec-env``\nand ``exec-file``. These commands will place all output into the environment of\na child process and into a temporary file, respectively. For example, if a\nprogram looks for credentials in its environment, ``exec-env`` can be used to\nensure that the decrypted contents are available only to this process and never\nwritten to disk.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   # print secrets to stdout to confirm values\n   $ sops -d out.json\n   {\n           "database_password": "jf48t9wfw094gf4nhdf023r",\n           "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",\n           "AWS_SECRET_KEY": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"\n   }\n   \n   # decrypt out.json and run a command\n   # the command prints the environment variable and runs a script that uses it\n   $ sops exec-env out.json \'echo secret: $database_password; ./database-import\'\n   secret: jf48t9wfw094gf4nhdf023r\n   \n   # launch a shell with the secrets available in its environment\n   $ sops exec-env out.json \'sh\'\n   sh-3.2# echo $database_password\n   jf48t9wfw094gf4nhdf023r\n   \n   # the secret is not accessible anywhere else\n   sh-3.2$ exit\n   $ echo your password: $database_password\n   your password: \n\n\nIf the command you want to run only operates on files, you can use ``exec-file``\ninstead. By default ``sops`` will use a FIFO to pass the contents of the\ndecrypted file to the new program. Using a FIFO, secrets are only passed in\nmemory which has two benefits: the plaintext secrets never touch the disk, and\nthe child process can only read the secrets once. In contexts where this won\'t\nwork, eg platforms like Windows where FIFOs unavailable or secret files that need\nto be available to the child process longer term, the ``--no-fifo`` flag can be\nused to instruct ``sops`` to use a traditional temporary file that will get cleaned\nup once the process is finished executing. ``exec-file`` behaves similar to\n``find(1)`` in that ``{}`` is used as a placeholder in the command which will be\nsubstituted with the temporary file path (whether a FIFO or an actual file).\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   # operating on the same file as before, but as a file this time\n   $ sops exec-file out.json \'echo your temporary file: {}; cat {}\'\n   your temporary file: /tmp/.sops894650499/tmp-file\n   {\n           "database_password": "jf48t9wfw094gf4nhdf023r",\n           "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",\n           "AWS_SECRET_KEY": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"\n   }\n   \n   # launch a shell with a variable TMPFILE pointing to the temporary file\n   $ sops exec-file --no-fifo out.json \'TMPFILE={} sh\'\n   sh-3.2$ echo $TMPFILE\n   /tmp/.sops506055069/tmp-file291138648\n   sh-3.2$ cat $TMPFILE\n   {\n           "database_password": "jf48t9wfw094gf4nhdf023r",\n           "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",\n           "AWS_SECRET_KEY": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"\n   }\n   sh-3.2$ ./program --config $TMPFILE\n   sh-3.2$ exit\n\n   # try to open the temporary file from earlier\n   $ cat /tmp/.sops506055069/tmp-file291138648\n   cat: /tmp/.sops506055069/tmp-file291138648: No such file or directory\n\nAdditionally, on unix-like platforms, both ``exec-env`` and ``exec-file``\nsupport dropping privileges before executing the new program via the\n``--user <username>`` flag. This is particularly useful in cases where the\nencrypted file is only readable by root, but the target program does not\nneed root privileges to function. This flag should be used where possible\nfor added security.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   # the encrypted file can\'t be read by the current user\n   $ cat out.json\n   cat: out.json: Permission denied\n   \n   # execute sops as root, decrypt secrets, then drop privileges\n   $ sudo sops exec-env --user nobody out.json \'sh\'\n   sh-3.2$ echo $database_password\n   jf48t9wfw094gf4nhdf023r\n\n   # dropped privileges, still can\'t load the original file\n   sh-3.2$ id\n   uid=4294967294(nobody) gid=4294967294(nobody) groups=4294967294(nobody)\n   sh-3.2$ cat out.json\n   cat: out.json: Permission denied\n\nUsing the publish command\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n``sops publish $file`` publishes a file to a pre-configured destination (this lives in the sops\nconfig file). Additionally, support re-encryption rules that work just like the creation rules.\n\nThis command requires a ``.sops.yaml`` configuration file. Below is an example:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n   destination_rules:\n      - s3_bucket: "sops-secrets"\n        path_regex: s3/*\n        recreation_rule:\n           pgp: F69E4901EDBAD2D1753F8C67A64535C4163FB307\n      - gcs_bucket: "sops-secrets"\n        path_regex: gcs/*\n        recreation_rule:\n           pgp: F69E4901EDBAD2D1753F8C67A64535C4163FB307\n      - vault_path: "sops/"\n        vault_kv_mount_name: "secret/" # default\n        vault_kv_version: 2 # default\n        path_regex: vault/*\n\nThe above configuration will place all files under ``s3/*`` into the S3 bucket ``sops-secrets``,\nall files under ``gcs/*`` into the GCS bucket ``sops-secrets``, and the contents of all files under\n``vault/*`` into Vault\'s KV store under the path ``secrets/sops/``. For the files that will be\npublished to S3 and GCS, it will decrypt them and re-encrypt them using the\n``F69E4901EDBAD2D1753F8C67A64535C4163FB307`` pgp key.\n\nYou would deploy a file to S3 with a command like: ``sops publish s3/app.yaml``\n\nPublishing to Vault\n*******************\n\nThere are a few settings for Vault that you can place in your destination rules. The first\nis ``vault_path``, which is required. The others are optional, and they are\n``vault_address``, ``vault_kv_mount_name``, ``vault_kv_version``.\n\n``sops`` uses the official Vault API provided by Hashicorp, which makes use of `environment\nvariables <https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/#environment-variables>`_ for\nconfiguring the client.\n\n``vault_kv_mount_name`` is used if your Vault KV is mounted somewhere other than ``secret/``.\n``vault_kv_version`` supports ``1`` and ``2``, with ``2`` being the default.\n\nBelow is an example of publishing to Vault (using token auth with a local dev instance of Vault).\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   $ export VAULT_TOKEN=...\n   $ export VAULT_ADDR=\'http://127.0.0.1:8200\'\n   $ sops -d vault/test.yaml\n   example_string: bar\n   example_number: 42\n   example_map:\n       key: value\n   $ sops publish vault/test.yaml\n   uploading /home/user/sops_directory/vault/test.yaml to http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/data/sops/test.yaml ? (y/n): y\n   $ vault kv get secret/sops/test.yaml\n   ====== Metadata ======\n   Key              Value\n   ---              -----\n   created_time     2019-07-11T03:32:17.074792017Z\n   deletion_time    n/a\n   destroyed        false\n   version          3\n\n   ========= Data =========\n   Key               Value\n   ---               -----\n   example_map       map[key:value]\n   example_number    42\n   example_string    bar\n\n\nImportant information on types\n------------------------------\n\nYAML and JSON type extensions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``sops`` uses the file extension to decide which encryption method to use on the file\ncontent. ``YAML``, ``JSON``, ``ENV``, and ``INI`` files are treated as trees of data, and key/values are\nextracted from the files to only encrypt the leaf values. The tree structure is also\nused to check the integrity of the file.\n\nTherefore, if a file is encrypted using a specific format, it need to be decrypted\nin the same format. The easiest way to achieve this is to conserve the original file\nextension after encrypting a file. For example:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops -e -i myfile.json\n\t$ sops -d myfile.json\n\nIf you want to change the extension of the file once encrypted, you need to provide\nsops with the ``--input-type`` flag upon decryption. For example:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops -e myfile.json > myfile.json.enc\n\n\t$ sops -d --input-type json myfile.json.enc\n\nWhen operating on stdin, use the ``--input-type`` and ``--output-type`` flags as follows:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cat myfile.json | sops --input-type json --output-type json -d /dev/stdin\n\nYAML anchors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n``sops`` only supports a subset of ``YAML``\'s many types. Encrypting YAML files that\ncontain strings, numbers and booleans will work fine, but files that contain anchors\nwill not work, because the anchors redefine the structure of the file at load time.\n\nThis file will not work in ``sops``:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n\tbill-to:  &id001\n\t    street: |\n\t        123 Tornado Alley\n\t        Suite 16\n\t    city:   East Centerville\n\t    state:  KS\n\n\tship-to:  *id001\n\n``sops`` uses the path to a value as additional data in the AEAD encryption, and thus\ndynamic paths generated by anchors break the authentication step.\n\nJSON and TEXT file types do not support anchors and thus have no such limitation.\n\nYAML Streams\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``YAML`` supports having more than one "document" in a single file, while\nformats like ``JSON`` do not. ``sops`` is able to handle both. This means the\nfollowing multi-document will be encrypted as expected:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n\t---\n\tdata: foo\n\t---\n\tdata: bar\n\nNote that the ``sops`` metadata, i.e. the hash, etc, is computed for the physical\nfile rather than each internal "document".\n\nTop-level arrays\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n``YAML`` and ``JSON`` top-level arrays are not supported, because ``sops``\nneeds a top-level ``sops`` key to store its metadata.\n\nThis file will not work in sops:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n\t---\n\t  - some\n\t  - array\n\t  - elements\n\nBut this one will because because the ``sops`` key can be added at the same level as the\n``data`` key.\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n\tdata:\n\t  - some\n\t  - array\n\t  - elements\n\nSimilarly, with ``JSON`` arrays, this document will not work:\n\n.. code:: json\n\n\t[\n\t  "some",\n\t  "array",\n\t  "elements"\n\t]\n\n\nBut this one will work just fine:\n\n.. code:: json\n\n\t{\n\t  "data": [\n\t    "some",\n\t    "array",\n\t    "elements"\n\t  ]\n\t}\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nTake a look into the `examples <https://github.com/mozilla/sops/tree/master/examples>`_ folder for detailed use cases of sops in a CI environment. The section below describes specific tips for common use cases.\n\nCreating a new file\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe command below creates a new file with a data key encrypted by KMS and PGP.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops --kms "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:927034868273:key/fe86dd69-4132-404c-ab86-4269956b4500" --pgp C9CAB0AF1165060DB58D6D6B2653B624D620786D /path/to/new/file.yaml\n\nEncrypting an existing file\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSimilar to the previous command, we tell sops to use one KMS and one PGP key.\nThe path points to an existing cleartext file, so we give sops flag ``-e`` to\nencrypt the file, and redirect the output to a destination file.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ export SOPS_KMS_ARN="arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:927034868273:key/fe86dd69-4132-404c-ab86-4269956b4500"\n\t$ export SOPS_PGP_FP="C9CAB0AF1165060DB58D6D6B2653B624D620786D"\n\t$ sops -e /path/to/existing/file.yaml > /path/to/new/encrypted/file.yaml\n\nDecrypt the file with ``-d``.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops -d /path/to/new/encrypted/file.yaml\n\nEncrypt or decrypt a file in place\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRather than redirecting the output of ``-e`` or ``-d``, sops can replace the\noriginal file after encrypting or decrypting it.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t# file.yaml is in cleartext\n\t$ sops -e -i /path/to/existing/file.yaml\n\t# file.yaml is now encrypted\n\t$ sops -d -i /path/to/existing/file.yaml\n\t# file.yaml is back in cleartext\n\nEncrypting binary files\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``sops`` primary use case is encrypting YAML and JSON configuration files, but it\nalso has the ability to manage binary files. When encrypting a binary, sops will\nread the data as bytes, encrypt it, store the encrypted base64 under\n``tree[\'data\']`` and write the result as JSON.\n\nNote that the base64 encoding of encrypted data can actually make the encrypted\nfile larger than the cleartext one.\n\nIn-place encryption/decryption also works on binary files.\n\n.. code::\n\n\t$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/somerandom bs=1024\n\tcount=512\n\t512+0 records in\n\t512+0 records out\n\t524288 bytes (524 kB) copied, 0.0466158 s, 11.2 MB/s\n\n\t$ sha512sum /tmp/somerandom\n\t9589bb20280e9d381f7a192000498c994e921b3cdb11d2ef5a986578dc2239a340b25ef30691bac72bdb14028270828dad7e8bd31e274af9828c40d216e60cbe /tmp/somerandom\n\n\t$ sops -e -i /tmp/somerandom\n\tplease wait while a data encryption key is being generated and stored securely\n\n\t$ sops -d -i /tmp/somerandom\n\n\t$ sha512sum /tmp/somerandom\n\t9589bb20280e9d381f7a192000498c994e921b3cdb11d2ef5a986578dc2239a340b25ef30691bac72bdb14028270828dad7e8bd31e274af9828c40d216e60cbe /tmp/somerandom\n\nExtract a sub-part of a document tree\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``sops`` can extract a specific part of a YAML or JSON document, by provided the\npath in the ``--extract`` command line flag. This is useful to extract specific\nvalues, like keys, without needing an extra parser.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops -d --extract \'["app2"]["key"]\' ~/git/svc/sops/example.yaml\n\t-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n\tMIIBPAIBAAJBAPTMNIyHuZtpLYc7VsHQtwOkWYobkUblmHWRmbXzlAX6K8tMf3Wf\n\tImcbNkqAKnELzFAPSBeEMhrBN0PyOC9lYlMCAwEAAQJBALXD4sjuBn1E7Y9aGiMz\n\tbJEBuZJ4wbhYxomVoQKfaCu+kH80uLFZKoSz85/ySauWE8LgZcMLIBoiXNhDKfQL\n\tvHECIQD6tCG9NMFWor69kgbX8vK5Y+QL+kRq+9HK6yZ9a+hsLQIhAPn4Ie6HGTjw\n\tfHSTXWZpGSan7NwTkIu4U5q2SlLjcZh/AiEA78NYRRBwGwAYNUqzutGBqyXKUl4u\n\tErb0xAEyVV7e8J0CIQC8VBY8f8yg+Y7Kxbw4zDYGyb3KkXL10YorpeuZR4LuQQIg\n\tbKGPkMM4w5blyE1tqGN0T7sJwEx+EUOgacRNqM2ljVA=\n\t-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n\nThe tree path syntax uses regular python dictionary syntax, without the\nvariable name. Extract keys by naming them, and array elements by numbering\nthem.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops -d --extract \'["an_array"][1]\' ~/git/svc/sops/example.yaml\n\tsecretuser2\n\nSet a sub-part in a document tree\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``sops`` can set a specific part of a YAML or JSON document, by providing\nthe path and value in the ``--set`` command line flag. This is useful to\nset specific values, like keys, without needing an editor.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops --set \'["app2"]["key"] "app2keystringvalue"\'  ~/git/svc/sops/example.yaml\n\nThe tree path syntax uses regular python dictionary syntax, without the\nvariable name. Set to keys by naming them, and array elements by\nnumbering them.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops --set \'["an_array"][1] "secretuser2"\' ~/git/svc/sops/example.yaml\n\nThe value must be formatted as json.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops --set \'["an_array"][1] {"uid1":null,"uid2":1000,"uid3":["bob"]}\' ~/git/svc/sops/example.yaml\n\nUsing sops as a library in a python script\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can import sops as a module and use it in your python program.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n\timport sops\n\n\tpathtype = sops.detect_filetype(path)\n\ttree = sops.load_file_into_tree(path, pathtype)\n\tsops_key, tree = sops.get_key(tree)\n\ttree = sops.walk_and_decrypt(tree, sops_key)\n\tsops.write_file(tree, path=path, filetype=pathtype)\n\nNote: this uses the previous implemenation of `sops` written in python,\nand so doesn\'t support newer features such as GCP-KMS.\nTo use the current version, call out to `sops` using `subprocess.check_output`\n\nShowing diffs in cleartext in git\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou most likely want to store encrypted files in a version controlled repository.\nSops can be used with git to decrypt files when showing diffs between versions.\nThis is very handy for reviewing changes or visualizing history.\n\nTo configure sops to decrypt files during diff, create a ``.gitattributes`` file\nat the root of your repository that contains a filter and a command.\n\n.. code::\n\n\t*.yaml diff=sopsdiffer\n\nHere we only care about YAML files. ``sopsdiffer`` is an arbitrary name that we map\nto a sops command in the git configuration file of the repository.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ git config diff.sopsdiffer.textconv "sops -d"\n\n\t$ grep -A 1 sopsdiffer .git/config\n\t[diff "sopsdiffer"]\n\t\ttextconv = "sops -d"\n\nWith this in place, calls to ``git diff`` will decrypt both previous and current\nversions of the target file prior to displaying the diff. And it even works with\ngit client interfaces, because they call git diff under the hood!\n\nEncrypting only parts of a file\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNote: this only works on YAML and JSON files, not on BINARY files.\n\nBy default, ``sops`` encrypts all the values of a YAML or JSON file and leaves the\nkeys in cleartext. In some instances, you may want to exclude some values from\nbeing encrypted. This can be accomplished by adding the suffix **_unencrypted**\nto any key of a file. When set, all values underneath the key that set the\n**_unencrypted** prefix will be left in cleartext.\n\nNote that, while in cleartext, unencrypted content is still added to the\nchecksum of the file, and thus cannot be modified outside of sops without\nbreaking the file integrity check.\n\nThe unencrypted suffix can be set to a different value using the\n``--unencrypted-suffix`` option.\n\nConversely, you can opt in to only encrypt some values in a YAML or JSON file,\nby adding a chosen suffix to those keys and passing it to the ``--encrypted-suffix`` option.\n\nA third method is to use the ``--encrypted-regex`` which will only encrypt values under\nkeys that match the supplied regular expression.  For example, this command:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops --encrypt --encrypted-regex \'^(data|stringData)$\' k8s-secrets.yaml\n\nwill encrypt the values under the ``data`` and ``stringData`` keys in a YAML file\ncontaining kubernetes secrets.  It will not encrypt other values that help you to\nnavigate the file, like ``metadata`` which contains the secrets\' names.\n\nYou can also specify these options in the ``.sops.yaml`` config file.\n\nNote: these three options ``--unencrypted-suffix``, ``--encrypted-suffix``, and ``--encrypted-regex`` are\nmutually exclusive and cannot all be used in the same file.\n\nEncryption Protocol\n-------------------\n\nWhen sops creates a file, it generates a random 256 bit data key and asks each\nKMS and PGP master key to encrypt the data key. The encrypted version of the data\nkey is stored in the ``sops`` metadata under ``sops.kms`` and ``sops.pgp``.\n\nFor KMS:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    sops:\n        kms:\n        -   enc: CiC6yCOtzsnFhkfdIslYZ0bAf//gYLYCmIu87B3sy/5yYxKnAQEBAQB4usgjrc7JxYZH3SLJWGdGwH//4GC2ApiLvOwd7Mv+cmMAAAB+MHwGCSqGSIb3DQEHBqBvMG0CAQAwaAYJKoZIhvcNAQcBMB4GCWCGSAFlAwQBLjARBAyGdRODuYMHbA8Ozj8CARCAO7opMolPJUmBXd39Zlp0L2H9fzMKidHm1vvaF6nNFq0ClRY7FlIZmTm4JfnOebPseffiXFn9tG8cq7oi\n            enc_ts: 1439568549.245995\n            arn: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:656532927350:key/920aff2e-c5f1-4040-943a-047fa387b27e\n\nFor PGP:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    sops:\n        pgp:\n        -   fp: 85D77543B3D624B63CEA9E6DBC17301B491B3F21\n            created_at: 1441570391.930042\n            enc: |\n                -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\n                Version: GnuPG v1\n\n                hQIMA0t4uZHfl9qgAQ//UvGAwGePyHuf2/zayWcloGaDs0MzI+zw6CmXvMRNPUsA\n                pAgRKczJmDu4+XzN+cxX5Iq9xEWIbny9B5rOjwTXT3qcUYZ4Gkzbq4MWkjuPp/Iv\n                qO4MJaYzoH5YxC4YORQ2LvzhA2YGsCzYnljmatGEUNg01yJ6r5mwFwDxl4Nc80Cn\n                RwnHuGExK8j1jYJZu/juK1qRbuBOAuruIPPWVdFB845PA7waacG1IdUW3ZtBkOy3\n                O0BIfG2ekRg0Nik6sTOhDUA+l2bewCcECI8FYCEjwHm9Sg5cxmP2V5m1mby+uKAm\n                kewaoOyjbmV1Mh3iI1b/AQMr+/6ZE9MT2KnsoWosYamFyjxV5r1ZZM7cWKnOT+tu\n                KOvGhTV1TeOfVpajNTNwtV/Oyh3mMLQ0F0HgCTqomQVqw5+sj7OWAASuD3CU/dyo\n                pcmY5Qe0TNL1JsMNEH8LJDqSh+E0hsUxdY1ouVsg3ysf6mdM8ciWb3WRGxih1Vmf\n                unfLy8Ly3V7ZIC8EHV8aLJqh32jIZV4i2zXIoO4ZBKrudKcECY1C2+zb/TziVAL8\n                qyPe47q8gi1rIyEv5uirLZjgpP+JkDUgoMnzlX334FZ9pWtQMYW4Y67urAI4xUq6\n                /q1zBAeHoeeeQK+YKDB7Ak/Y22YsiqQbNp2n4CKSKAE4erZLWVtDvSp+49SWmS/S\n                XgGi+13MaXIp0ecPKyNTBjF+NOw/I3muyKr8EbDHrd2XgIT06QXqjYLsCb1TZ0zm\n                xgXsOTY3b+ONQ2zjhcovanDp7/k77B+gFitLYKg4BLZsl7gJB12T8MQnpfSmRT4=\n                =oJgS\n                -----END PGP MESSAGE-----\n\n``sops`` then opens a text editor on the newly created file. The user adds data to the\nfile and saves it when done.\n\nUpon save, sops browses the entire file as a key/value tree. Every time sops\nencounters a leaf value (a value that does not have children), it encrypts the\nvalue with AES256_GCM using the data key and a 256 bit random initialization\nvector.\n\nEach file uses a single data key to encrypt all values of a document, but each\nvalue receives a unique initialization vector and has unique authentication data.\n\nAdditional data is used to guarantee the integrity of the encrypted data\nand of the tree structure: when encrypting the tree, key names are concatenated\ninto a byte string that is used as AEAD additional data (aad) when encrypting\nvalues. We expect that keys do not carry sensitive information, and\nkeeping them in cleartext allows for better diff and overall readability.\n\nAny valid KMS or PGP master key can later decrypt the data key and access the\ndata.\n\nMultiple master keys allow for sharing encrypted files without sharing master\nkeys, and provide a disaster recovery solution. The recommended way to use sops\nis to have two KMS master keys in different regions and one PGP public key with\nthe private key stored offline. If, by any chance, both KMS master keys are\nlost, you can always recover the encrypted data using the PGP private key.\n\nMessage Authentication Code\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn addition to authenticating branches of the tree using keys as additional\ndata, sops computes a MAC on all the values to ensure that no value has been\nadded or removed fraudulently. The MAC is stored encrypted with AES_GCM and\nthe data key under tree->`sops`->`mac`.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nAutomating the distribution of secrets and credentials to components of an\ninfrastructure is a hard problem. We know how to encrypt secrets and share them\nbetween humans, but extending that trust to systems is difficult. Particularly\nwhen these systems follow devops principles and are created and destroyed\nwithout human intervention. The issue boils down to establishing the initial\ntrust of a system that just joined the infrastructure, and providing it access\nto the secrets it needs to configure itself.\n\nThe initial trust\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn many infrastructures, even highly dynamic ones, the initial trust is\nestablished by a human. An example is seen in Puppet by the way certificates are\nissued: when a new system attempts to join a Puppetmaster, an administrator\nmust, by default, manually approve the issuance of the certificate the system\nneeds. This is cumbersome, and many puppetmasters are configured to auto-sign\nnew certificates to work around that issue. This is obviously not recommended\nand far from ideal.\n\nAWS provides a more flexible approach to trusting new systems. It uses a\npowerful mechanism of roles and identities. In AWS, it is possible to verify\nthat a new system has been granted a specific role at creation, and it is\npossible to map that role to specific resources. Instead of trusting new systems\ndirectly, the administrator trusts the AWS permission model and its automation\ninfrastructure. As long as AWS keys are safe, and the AWS API is secure, we can\nassume that trust is maintained and systems are who they say they are.\n\nKMS, Trust and secrets distribution\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUsing the AWS trust model, we can create fine grained access controls to\nAmazon\'s Key Management Service (KMS). KMS is a service that encrypts and\ndecrypts data with AES_GCM, using keys that are never visible to users of the\nservice. Each KMS master key has a set of role-based access controls, and\nindividual roles are permitted to encrypt or decrypt using the master key. KMS\nhelps solve the problem of distributing keys, by shifting it into an access\ncontrol problem that can be solved using AWS\'s trust model.\n\nOperational requirements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhen Mozilla\'s Services Operations team started revisiting the issue of\ndistributing secrets to EC2 instances, we set a goal to store these secrets\nencrypted until the very last moment, when they need to be decrypted on target\nsystems. Not unlike many other organizations that operate sufficiently complex\nautomation, we found this to be a hard problem with a number of prerequisites:\n\n1. Secrets must be stored in YAML files for easy integration into hiera\n\n2. Secrets must be stored in GIT, and when a new CloudFormation stack is\n   built, the current HEAD is pinned to the stack. (This allows secrets to\n   be changed in GIT without impacting the current stack that may\n   autoscale).\n\n3. Entries must be encrypted separately. Encrypting entire files as blobs makes\n   git conflict resolution almost impossible. Encrypting each entry\n   separately is much easier to manage.\n\n4. Secrets must always be encrypted on disk (admin laptop, upstream\n   git repo, jenkins and S3) and only be decrypted on the target\n   systems\n\nSOPS can be used to encrypt YAML, JSON and BINARY files. In BINARY mode, the\ncontent of the file is treated as a blob, the same way PGP would encrypt an\nentire file. In YAML and JSON modes, however, the content of the file is\nmanipulated as a tree where keys are stored in cleartext, and values are\nencrypted. hiera-eyaml does something similar, and over the years we learned\nto appreciate its benefits, namely:\n\n* diffs are meaningful. If a single value of a file is modified, only that\n  value will show up in the diff. The diff is still limited to only showing\n  encrypted data, but that information is already more granular that\n  indicating that an entire file has changed.\n\n* conflicts are easier to resolve. If multiple users are working on the\n  same encrypted files, as long as they don\'t modify the same values,\n  changes are easy to merge. This is an improvement over the PGP\n  encryption approach where unsolvable conflicts often happen when\n  multiple users work on the same file.\n\nOpenPGP integration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOpenPGP gets a lot of bad press for being an outdated crypto protocol, and while\ntrue, what really made us look for alternatives is the difficulty of managing and\ndistributing keys to systems. With KMS, we manage permissions to an API, not keys,\nand that\'s a lot easier to do.\n\nBut PGP is not dead yet, and we still rely on it heavily as a backup solution:\nall our files are encrypted with KMS and with one PGP public key, with its\nprivate key stored securely for emergency decryption in the event that we lose\nall our KMS master keys.\n\nSOPS can be used without KMS entirely, the same way you would use an encrypted\nPGP file: by referencing the pubkeys of each individual who has access to the file.\nIt can easily be done by providing sops with a comma-separated list of public keys\nwhen creating a new file:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n\t$ sops --pgp "E60892BB9BD89A69F759A1A0A3D652173B763E8F,84050F1D61AF7C230A12217687DF65059EF093D3,85D77543B3D624B63CEA9E6DBC17301B491B3F21" mynewfile.yaml\n\nThreat Model\n------------\n\nThe security of the data stored using sops is as strong as the weakest\ncryptographic mechanism. Values are encrypted using AES256_GCM which is the\nstrongest symmetric encryption algorithm known today. Data keys are encrypted\nin either KMS, which also uses AES256_GCM, or PGP which uses either RSA or\nECDSA keys.\n\nGoing from the most likely to the least likely, the threats are as follows:\n\nCompromised AWS credentials grant access to KMS master key\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAn attacker with access to an AWS console can grant itself access to one of\nthe KMS master keys used to encrypt a sops data key. This threat should be\nmitigated by protecting AWS accesses with strong controls, such as multi-factor\nauthentication, and also by performing regular audits of permissions granted\nto AWS users.\n\nCompromised PGP key\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPGP keys are routinely mishandled, either because owners copy them from\nmachine to machine, or because the key is left forgotten on an unused machine\nan attacker gains access to. When using PGP encryption, sops users should take\nspecial care of PGP private keys, and store them on smart cards or offline\nas often as possible.\n\nFactorized RSA key\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nsops doesn\'t apply any restriction on the size or type of PGP keys. A weak PGP\nkeys, for example 512 bits RSA, could be factorized by an attacker to gain\naccess to the private key and decrypt the data key. Users of sops should rely\non strong keys, such as 2048+ bits RSA keys, or 256+ bits ECDSA keys.\n\nWeak AES cryptography\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA vulnerability in AES256_GCM could potentially leak the data key or the KMS\nmaster key used by a sops encrypted file. While no such vulnerability exists\ntoday, we recommend that users keep their encrypted files reasonably private.\n\nBackward compatibility\n----------------------\n\n``sops`` will remain backward compatible on the major version, meaning that all\nimprovements brought to the 1.X and 2.X branches (current) will maintain the\nfile format introduced in **1.0**.\n\nSecurity\n--------\n\nPlease report security issues to jvehent at mozilla dot com, or by using one\nof the contact method available on keybase: `https://keybase.io/jvehent <https://keybase.io/jvehent>`_\n\nLicense\n-------\nMozilla Public License Version 2.0\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\nThe core team is composed of:\n\n* Adrian Utrilla @autrilla\n* Julien Vehent @jvehent\n* AJ Banhken @ajvb\n\nAnd a whole bunch of `contributors <https://github.com/mozilla/sops/graphs/contributors>`_\n\nCredits\n-------\n\n`sops` was inspired by `hiera-eyaml <https://github.com/TomPoulton/hiera-eyaml>`_,\n`credstash <https://github.com/LuminalOSS/credstash>`_ ,\n`sneaker <https://github.com/codahale/sneaker>`_,\n`password store <http://www.passwordstore.org/>`_ and too many years managing\nPGP encrypted files by hand...\n'
