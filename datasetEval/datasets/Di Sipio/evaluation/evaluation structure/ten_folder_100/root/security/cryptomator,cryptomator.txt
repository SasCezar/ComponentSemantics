If you are also interested in further development, we offer you the opportunity to support us:\n\n- [One-time or recurring donation via Cryptomator's website.](https://cryptomator.org/#donate)\n- [Become a sponsor via Cryptomator's sponsors website.](https://cryptomator.org/sponsors/)\n\n### Silver Sponsors\n\n[![TheBestVPN](https://cryptomator.org/img/sponsors/thebestvpn.png)](https://thebestvpn.com/)\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nCryptomator offers multi-platform transparent client-side encryption of your files in the cloud.\n\nDownload native binaries of Cryptomator on [cryptomator.org](https://cryptomator.org/) or clone and build Cryptomator using Maven (instructions below).\n\n## Features\n\n- Works with Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, ownCloud, Nextcloud and any other cloud storage service which synchronizes with a local directory\n- Open Source means: No backdoors, control is better than trust\n- Client-side: No accounts, no data shared with any online service\n- Totally transparent: Just work on the virtual drive as if it were a USB flash drive\n- AES encryption with 256-bit key length\n- File names get encrypted\n- Folder structure gets obfuscated\n- Use as many vaults in your Dropbox as you want, each having individual passwords\n- One thousand commits for the security of your data!! :tada:\n\n### Privacy\n\n- 256-bit keys (unlimited strength policy bundled with native binaries)\n- Scrypt key derivation\n- Cryptographically secure random numbers for salts, IVs and the masterkey of course\n- Sensitive data is wiped from the heap asap\n- Lightweight: [Complexity kills security](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/1999/11/a_plea_for_simplicit.html)\n\n### Consistency\n\n- HMAC over file contents to recognize changed ciphertext before decryption\n- I/O operations are transactional and atomic, if the filesystems support it\n- Each file contains all information needed for decryption (except for the key of course), no common metadata means no [SPOF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure)\n\n### Security Architecture\n\nFor more information on the security details visit [cryptomator.org](https://cryptomator.org/architecture/).\n\n## Building\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* JDK 11 (we recommend to use the latest version)\n* Maven 3\n* Optional: OS-dependent build tools for native packaging (see [Windows](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-win), [OS X](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-osx), [Linux](https://github.com/cryptomator/builder-containers))\n\n### Run Maven\n\n```\ncd main\nmvn clean install -Prelease\n```\n\nThis will build all the jars and bundle them together with their OS-specific dependencies under `main/buildkit/target`. This can now be used to build native packages.\n\n### Start Cryptomator\n\nIf you unzip the buildkit for your OS, you will find a launcher script with some basic settings. You might want to adjust these to your needs. To start Cryptomator, simply execute the launcher script from a terminal, e.g. `launcher-linux.sh`, if you're on a Linux system.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is dual-licensed under the GPLv3 for FOSS projects as well as a commercial license for independent software vendors and resellers.
