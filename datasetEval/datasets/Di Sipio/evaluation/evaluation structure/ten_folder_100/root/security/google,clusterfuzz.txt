b'# ClusterFuzz\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="docs/images/logo.png" width="400">\n</p>\n\nClusterFuzz is a scalable [fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)\ninfrastructure that finds security and stability issues in software.\n\nGoogle uses ClusterFuzz to fuzz the Chrome Browser and as the fuzzing\nbackend for [OSS-Fuzz].\n\nClusterFuzz provides many features which help seamlessly integrate fuzzing into\na software project\'s development process:\n- Highly scalable. Google\'s internal instance runs on over 25,000 machines.\n- Accurate deduplication of crashes.\n- Fully automatic bug filing and closing for issue trackers\n  ([Monorail] only for now).\n- Testcase minimization.\n- Regression finding through [bisection].\n- Statistics for analyzing fuzzer performance, and crash rates.\n- Easy to use web interface for management and viewing crashes.\n- [Firebase authentication].\n- Support for coverage guided fuzzing (e.g. libFuzzer and AFL) and blackbox\n  fuzzing.\n\n## Overview\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="docs/images/overview.png">\n</p>\n\n## Documentation\nYou can find detailed documentation [here](https://google.github.io/clusterfuzz).\n\n## Trophies\nAs of January 2019, ClusterFuzz has found [~16,000] bugs\nin Chrome and [~11,000] bugs in over [160] open source projects integrated with\n[OSS-Fuzz].\n\n## Getting Help\nYou can [file an issue](https://github.com/google/clusterfuzz/issues/new) to ask\nquestions, request features, or ask for help.\n\n## Staying Up to Date\nWe will use [clusterfuzz-announce(#)googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clusterfuzz-announce) to make announcements about ClusterFuzz.\n\n[~16,000]: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AClusterFuzz+-status%3AWontFix%2CDuplicate\n[~11,000]: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?can=1&q=-status%3AWontFix%2CDuplicate+-Infra\n[160]: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects\n[OSS-Fuzz]: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz\n[Monorail]: https://opensource.google.com/projects/monorail\n[bisection]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_(software_engineering)\n[Firebase authentication]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth\n'
