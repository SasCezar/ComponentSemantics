b'# OSS-Fuzz: Continuous Fuzzing for Open Source Software\n\n[Fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing) is a well-known\ntechnique for uncovering programming errors in software.\nMany of these detectable errors, like [buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow), can have serious security implications. Google has found [thousands] of security vulnerabilities and stability bugs by deploying [guided in-process fuzzing of Chrome components](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/08/guided-in-process-fuzzing-of-chrome.html),\nand we now want to share that service with the open source community. \n\n[thousands]: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q=label%3AStability-LibFuzzer%2CStability-AFL%20-status%3ADuplicate%2CWontFix&can=1\n\nIn cooperation with the [Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/), \nOSS-Fuzz aims to make common open source software more secure and stable by\ncombining modern fuzzing techniques with scalable,\ndistributed execution.\n\nWe support the [libFuzzer](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) and [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) fuzzing engines\nin combination with [Sanitizers](https://github.com/google/sanitizers), as well as\n[ClusterFuzz](https://github.com/google/clusterfuzz),\na distributed fuzzer execution environment and reporting tool. \n\nCurrently, OSS-Fuzz supports C/C++, Rust, and Go code. Other languages supported by [LLVM](http://llvm.org) may work too.\nOSS-Fuzz supports fuzzing x86_64 and i386 builds.\n\n## Overview\n![OSS-Fuzz process diagram](docs/images/process.png)\n\n## Documentation\nRead our [detailed documentation](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz) to learn how to use OSS-Fuzz.\n\n## Trophies\nAs of August 2019, OSS-Fuzz has found over [14,000] bugs in [200] open source projects.\n\n[14,000]: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?can=1&q=-status%3AWontFix%2CDuplicate+-Infra\n[200]: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects\n\n## Blog posts\n\n* 2016-12-01 - [Announcing OSS-Fuzz: Continuous fuzzing for open source software](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2016/12/announcing-oss-fuzz-continuous-fuzzing.html)\n* 2017-05-08 - [OSS-Fuzz: Five months later, and rewarding projects](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/05/oss-fuzz-five-months-later-and.html)\n* 2018-11-06 - [A New Chapter for OSS-Fuzz](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/11/a-new-chapter-for-oss-fuzz.html)\n\n\n'
