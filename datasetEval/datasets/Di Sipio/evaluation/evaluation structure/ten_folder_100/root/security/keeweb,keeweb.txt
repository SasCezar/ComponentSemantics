b'# Free cross-platform password manager compatible with KeePass\n\nThis webapp is a browser and desktop password manager compatible with KeePass databases. It doesn\'t require any server or additional resources.\nThe app can run either in browser, or as a desktop app.\n\n![screenshot](img/screenshot.png)\n\n# Quick Links\n\nApps: [Web](https://app.keeweb.info/), [Desktop](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/releases/latest)  \nTimeline: [Release Notes](release-notes.md), [TODO](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/wiki/TODO)  \nOn one page: [Features](https://keeweb.info/#features), [FAQ](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/wiki/FAQ)  \nWebsite: [keeweb.info](https://keeweb.info)  \nTwitter: [kee_web](https://twitter.com/kee_web)  \nDonate: [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/keeweb#support), [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/antelle)  \n\n# Status\n\nThe app is quite stable now. Basic stuff, as well as more advanced operations, should be rather reliable.\n\n# Self-hosting\n\nEverything you need to host this app on your server is any static file server. The app is a single HTML file + a service worker (optionally; for offline access).\nYou can download the latest distribution files from [gh-pages](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/archive/gh-pages.zip) branch.  \n\nIf you are using Docker:\n\n1. put your dh.pem, cert.pem, key.pem to /etc/nginx/external/ \n2. run this script:\n```bash\ndocker run --name keeweb -d -p 443:443 -p 80:80 -v $EXT_DIR:/etc/nginx/external/ antelle/keeweb\n```\n\nTo make Dropbox work in your self-hosted app, [go to this Wiki page](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/wiki/Dropbox-and-GDrive).\n\n# Building\n\nThe easiest way to clone all KeeWeb repos is:\n```bash\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keeweb/keeweb/develop/dev-env.sh | bash -\n```\n\nThe app can be built with grunt: `grunt` (html file will be in `dist/`).    \nDesktop apps are built with `grunt desktop`. This works only in macOS as it builds dmg; requires wine.  \nAlso, a hardware token is required.  \nTo run Electron app without building an installer, build the app with `grunt` and start it this way:\n```bash\ngrunt dev\nnpm run-script electron\n```\n\nFor debug build:\n\n1. run `grunt dev`\n2. open `http://localhost:8085`\n\n# Contributing\n\nPlease read contribution guidelines [for pull requests](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).  \nHere\'s a [list of issues](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/labels/help%20wanted) where your help would be very welcome.\nAlso you can help by [translating KeeWeb](https://keeweb.oneskyapp.com) to your language.  \n\n### Important notes for pull requests\n\n- please branch from `develop`, not `master`\n- don\'t edit translation files except base.json, they will be replaced\n\n# Donations\n\nKeeWeb is not free to develop. It takes time, requires paid code signing certificates and domains.  \nYou can help the project or say "thank you" with this button:  \n[<img src="https://opencollective.com/keeweb/tiers/backer.svg?avatarHeight=42&width=880" alt="OpenCollective">](https://opencollective.com/keeweb#support)\n\nYou can also sponsor the developer directly [on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/antelle).  \n\nPlease note: donation does not imply any type of service contract.  \n\n\n# License\n\n[MIT](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/blob/master/LICENSE)\n'
