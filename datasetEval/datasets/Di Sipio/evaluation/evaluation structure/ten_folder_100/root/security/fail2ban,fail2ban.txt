It does this by updating system firewall rules\nto reject new connections from those IP addresses, for a configurable amount\nof time. Fail2Ban comes out-of-the-box ready to read many standard log files,\nsuch as those for sshd and Apache, and is easily configured to read any log\nfile of your choosing, for any error you wish.\n\nThough Fail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of incorrect authentication\nattempts, it cannot eliminate the risk presented by weak authentication.\nSet up services to use only two factor, or public/private authentication\nmechanisms if you really want to protect services.\n     \n<img src="http://www.worldipv6launch.org/wp-content/themes/ipv6/downloads/World_IPv6_launch_logo.svg" height="52pt"/> | Since v0.10 fail2ban supports the matching of IPv6 addresses.\n------|------\n\nThis README is a quick introduction to Fail2Ban. More documentation, FAQ, and HOWTOs\nto be found on fail2ban(1) manpage, [Wiki](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/wiki),\n[Developers documentation](https://fail2ban.readthedocs.io/)\nand the website: https://www.fail2ban.org\n\nInstallation:\n-------------\n\n**It is possible that Fail2Ban is already packaged for your distribution.  In\nthis case, you should use that instead.**\n\nRequired:\n- [Python2 >= 2.6 or Python >= 3.2](https://www.python.org) or [PyPy](https://pypy.org)\n\nOptional:\n- [pyinotify >= 0.8.3](https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify), may require:\n  * Linux >= 2.6.13\n- [gamin >= 0.0.21](http://www.gnome.org/~veillard/gamin)\n- [systemd >= 204](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd) and python bindings:\n  * [python-systemd package](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/python-systemd/index.html)\n- [dnspython](http://www.dnspython.org/)\n\n\nTo install:\n\n    tar xvfj fail2ban-0.11.0.tar.bz2\n    cd fail2ban-0.11.0\n    sudo python setup.py install\n   \nAlternatively, you can clone the source from GitHub to a directory of Your choice, and do the install from there. Pick the correct branch, for example, 0.11\n\n    git clone https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban.git\n    cd fail2ban\n    sudo python setup.py install \n    \nThis will install Fail2Ban into the python library directory. The executable\nscripts are placed into `/usr/bin`, and configuration in `/etc/fail2ban`.\n\nFail2Ban should be correctly installed now. Just type:\n\n    fail2ban-client -h\n\nto see if everything is alright. You should always use fail2ban-client and\nnever call fail2ban-server directly.\nYou can verify that you have the correct version installed with \n\n    fail2ban-client version\n\nPlease note that the system init/service script is not automatically installed.\nTo enable fail2ban as an automatic service, simply copy the script for your\ndistro from the `files` directory to `/etc/init.d`. Example (on a Debian-based\nsystem):\n\n    cp files/debian-initd /etc/init.d/fail2ban\n    update-rc.d fail2ban defaults\n    service fail2ban start\n\nConfiguration:\n--------------\n\nYou can configure Fail2Ban using the files in `/etc/fail2ban`. It is possible to\nconfigure the server using commands sent to it by `fail2ban-client`. The\navailable commands are described in the fail2ban-client(1) manpage.  Also see\nfail2ban(1) and jail.conf(5)  manpages for further references.\n\nCode status:\n------------\n\n* travis-ci.org: [![tests status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/fail2ban/fail2ban.svg?branch=0.11)](https://travis-ci.org/fail2ban/fail2ban?branch=0.11) (0.11 branch) / [![tests status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/fail2ban/fail2ban.svg?branch=0.10)](https://travis-ci.org/fail2ban/fail2ban?branch=0.10) (0.10 branch) \n\n* coveralls.io: [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/fail2ban/fail2ban/badge.svg?branch=0.11)](https://coveralls.io/github/fail2ban/fail2ban?branch=0.11) (0.11 branch) / [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/fail2ban/fail2ban/badge.svg?branch=0.10)](https://coveralls.io/github/fail2ban/fail2ban?branch=0.10) / (0.10 branch)\n\n* codecov.io: [![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/gh/fail2ban/fail2ban/coverage.svg?branch=0.11)](https://codecov.io/gh/fail2ban/fail2ban/branch/0.11) (0.11 branch) / [![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/gh/fail2ban/fail2ban/coverage.svg?branch=0.10)](https://codecov.io/gh/fail2ban/fail2ban/branch/0.10) (0.10 branch)\n\nContact:\n--------\n\n### Bugs, feature requests, discussions?\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### You just appreciate this program:\nSend kudos to the original author ([Cyril Jaquier](mailto:cyril.jaquier@fail2ban.org))\nor *better* to the [mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fail2ban-users)\nsince Fail2Ban is "community-driven" for years now.\n\nThanks:\n-------\n\nSee [THANKS](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/blob/master/THANKS) file.\n\nLicense:\n--------\n\nFail2Ban is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the\nterms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\nFoundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later\nversion.\n\nFail2Ban is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\nWARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE.
