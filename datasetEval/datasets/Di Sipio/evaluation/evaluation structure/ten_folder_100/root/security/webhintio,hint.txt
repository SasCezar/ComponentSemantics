That means that the code\nfor all the webhint flavors (CLI, browser and VS Code extension,\nhints, formatters, etc.) are in here and are published as separate\nnpm packages.\n\nTo build the project from the source you will need to install\na recent version of node and [yarn][]. Once you\'ve done this run\nthe following from the root of your cloned version:\n\n```bash\nyarn\nyarn build\n```\n\nThis can take a bit so please be patient.\n\nTo learn more about the internals of `webhint`, the structure of the\nproject, how to create new hints, parsers, formatters, etc, take\na look at the online [contributor guide][contributor guide] (or the\n[local version][local contributor guide]).\n\n### Contributing to the browser and VS Code extensions\n\nTo learn about how to build one of the extensions please check\nthe `CONTRIBUTING.md` files for each of these packages:\n\n* [`packages/extension-browser/CONTRIBUTING.md`][contrib browser]\n  for the browser extension.\n* [`packages/extension-vscode/CONTRIBUTING.md`][contrib vscode]\n  for the VS Code extension.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nAll projects in the `webhintio` organization follow this [CoC][coc]\nwhich adheres to the [OpenJS Foundation Code of Conduct][ojs coc].\n\n## License\n\nThe code is available under the [Apache 2.0 license][license].\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwebhintio%2Fhint.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwebhintio%2Fhint?ref=badge_large)\n\n<!-- Link labels: -->\n\n[browser extension]: https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/extensions/extension-browser/\n[coc]: https://github.com/webhintio/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT\n[contrib browser]: ./packages/extension-browser/CONTRIBUTING.md\n[contrib vscode]: ./packages/extension-vscode/CONTRIBUTING.md\n[contributor guide]: https://webhint.io/docs/contributor-guide/\n[license]: LICENSE.txt\n[local contributor guide]: ./packages/hint/docs/contributor-guide/index.md\n[local user guide]: ./packages/hint/docs/user-guide/index.md\n[node]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/\n[npx]: https://github.com/zkat/npx\n[ojs coc]: https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n[online service]: https://webhint.io/scanner/\n[user guide]: https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/\n[VS Code extension]: https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/extensions/vscode-webhint/\n[yarn]: http://yarnpkg.com/\n'
