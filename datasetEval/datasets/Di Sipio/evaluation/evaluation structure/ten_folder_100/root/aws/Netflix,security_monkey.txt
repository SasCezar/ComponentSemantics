b'# NOTE: Security Monkey is in maintenance mode and will be end-of-life in 2020.\n\n- For AWS users, please make use of [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/).\n- For GCP users, please make use of [Cloud Asset Inventory](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview).\n\nSecurity Monkey\n===============\n\n<img align="right" alt="Security Monkey Logo 2017" src="docs/images/Security_Monkey.png" width="50%">\n\nSecurity Monkey monitors your [AWS and GCP accounts](https://medium.com/@Netflix_Techblog/netflix-security-monkey-on-google-cloud-platform-gcp-f221604c0cc7) for policy changes and alerts on insecure configurations.  Support is available for OpenStack public and private clouds.  Security Monkey can also watch and monitor your GitHub organizations, teams, and repositories.\n\nIt provides a single UI to browse and search through all of your accounts, regions, and cloud services.  The monkey remembers previous states and can show you exactly what changed, and when.\n\nSecurity Monkey can be extended with [custom account types](docs/plugins.md), [custom watchers](docs/development.md#adding-a-watcher), [custom auditors](docs/development.md#adding-an-auditor), and [custom alerters](docs/misc.md#custom-alerters).\n\nIt works on CPython 2.7. It is known to work on Ubuntu Linux and OS X.\n\n[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/Netflix/security_monkey)\n\n| Develop Branch  | Master Branch |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Netflix/security_monkey.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Netflix/security_monkey)  | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Netflix/security_monkey.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Netflix/security_monkey)  |\n| [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Netflix/security_monkey/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/Netflix/security_monkey?branch=develop)  | [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Netflix/security_monkey/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Netflix/security_monkey?branch=master) |\n\n### Special Note:\nNetflix\'s support for Security Monkey has been reduced for minor bug fixes only.
