b'aws-shell - The interactive productivity booster for the AWS CLI\n================================================================\n\n.. image:: https://aws-developer-blog-media.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cli/Super-Charge-Your-AWS-Command-Line-Experience-with-aws-shell/aws-shell-final.gif\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThe aws-shell requires python and `pip`_ to install.\nYou can install the aws-shell using `pip`_::\n\n    $ pip install aws-shell\n\nIf you are not installing into a virtualenv you can run::\n\n    $ sudo pip install aws-shell\n\n**Mac OS X (10.11 El Capitan) users**: There is a known issue with Apple and\nits included python package dependencies (more info at\nhttps://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3165).\nWe are investigating ways to fix this issue but in the meantime,\nto install the aws-shell, you can run:\n``sudo pip install aws-shell --upgrade --ignore-installed six``\n\nOnce you\'ve installed the aws-shell, you can now run::\n\n    $ aws-shell\n\nTo exit the shell, press ``Ctrl-D``.\n\nUpgrading the aws-shell\n-----------------------\n\nIf you want to upgrade to the latest version of the aws-shell,\nyou can run::\n\n    $ pip install --upgrade aws-shell\n\nYou can also use this upgrade command whenever a new version of the AWS CLI is\nreleased that includes new services and API updates.  You will then be\nable to use these new services and API updates in the aws-shell.\n\nSupported Python Versions\n-------------------------\n\nThe aws-shell works on the same python versions supported by the AWS CLI:\n\n* 2.6.5 and greater\n* 2.7.x and greater\n* 3.3.x and greater\n* 3.4.x and greater\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nThe aws-shell uses the same configuration settings as the AWS CLI.\nIf you\'ve never used the AWS CLI before, the easiest way to get\nstarted is to run the ``configure`` command::\n\n    $ aws-shell\n    aws> configure\n    AWS Access Key ID [None]: your-access-key-id\n    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: your-secret-access-key\n    Default region name [None]: region-to-use (e.g us-west-2, us-west-1, etc).\n    Default output format [None]:\n    aws>\n\nFor more information about configure settings, see the\n`AWS CLI Getting Started Guide`_.\n\nBasic Usage\n===========\n\nThe aws-shell accepts the same commands as the AWS CLI, except you don\'t\nneed to provide the ``aws`` prefix.  For example, here are a few commands\nyou can try::\n\n\n    $ aws-shell\n    aws> ec2 describe-regions\n    {\n        "Regions": [\n            {\n                "Endpoint": "ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com",\n                "RegionName": "eu-west-1"\n            },\n            ...\n    aws> s3 ls\n    2015-12-07 15:03:34 bucket1\n    2015-12-07 15:03:34 bucket2\n    aws> dynamodb list-tables --output text\n    TABLENAMES     First\n    TABLENAMES     Second\n    TABLENAMES     Third\n\nProfiles\n--------\n\nThe aws-shell supports AWS CLI profiles.  You have two options to use\nprofiles.  First, you can provide a profile when you start the aws-shell::\n\n    $ aws-shell --profile prod\n    aws>\n\nWhen you do this all the server side completion as well as CLI commands\nyou run will automatically use the ``prod`` profile.\n\nYou can also change the current profile while you\'re in the aws-shell::\n\n    $ aws-shell\n    aws> .profile demo\n    Current shell profile changed to: demo\n\nYou can also check what profile you\'ve configured in the aws-shell using::\n\n    aws> .profile\n    Current shell profile: demo\n\nAfter changing your profile using the ``.profile`` dot command, all\nserver side completion as well as CLI commands will automatically use\nthe new profile you\'ve configured.\n\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nAuto Completion of Commands and Options\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe aws-shell provides auto completion of commands and\noptions as you type.\n\n\n.. image:: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/368057/11824078/784a613e-a32c-11e5-8ac5-f1d1873cc643.png\n\n\nShorthand Auto Completion\n-------------------------\n\nThe aws-shell can also fill in an example of the\nshorthand syntax used for various AWS CLI options:\n\n.. image:: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/368057/11823453/e95d85da-a328-11e5-8b8d-67566eccf9e3.png\n\n\nServer Side Auto Completion\n---------------------------\n\nThe aws-shell also leverages `boto3`_, the AWS SDK for Python, to auto complete\nserver side resources such as Amazon EC2 instance Ids, Amazon Dynamodb table\nnames, AWS IAM user names, Amazon S3 bucket names, etc.\n\nThis feature is under active development.  The list of supported resources\ncontinues to grow.\n\n.. image:: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/368057/11824022/3648b4fc-a32c-11e5-8e18-92f028eb1cee.png\n\n\nFuzzy Searching\n---------------\n\nEvery auto completion value supports fuzzy searching.  This enables you to\nspecify the commands, options, and values you want to run with even less\ntyping.  You can try typing:\n\n* The first letter of each sub word: ``ec2 describe-reserved-instances-offerings``\n  -> ``ec2 drio``\n* A little bit of each word: ``ec2 describe-instances`` -> ``ec2 descinst``\n* Any part of the command: ``dynamodb table`` -> Offers all commands that\n  contain the subsequence ``table``.\n\n\n.. image:: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/368057/11823996/18e69d16-a32c-11e5-80a2-defbaa6a8a80.png\n\nInline Documentation\n--------------------\n\nThe aws-shell will automatically pull up documentation as you type commands.\nIt will show inline documentation for CLI options.  There is also a separate\ndocumentation panel that will show documentation for the current command or\noption you are typing. Pressing F9 will toggle focus to the documentation panel\nallowing you to navigate it using your selected keybindings.\n\n\n.. image:: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/368057/11823320/36ae9b04-a328-11e5-9661-81abfc0afe5a.png\n\n\nFish-Style Auto Suggestions\n---------------------------\n\nThe aws-shell supports Fish-style auto-suggestions. Use the right arrow key to\ncomplete a suggestion.\n\n.. image:: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/368057/11822961/4bceff94-a326-11e5-87fa-c664e1e82be4.png\n\nCommand History\n---------------\n\nThe aws-shell records the commands you run and writes them to\n``~/.aws/shell/history``.  You can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll\nthrough your history.\n\n.. image:: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/368057/11823211/b5851e9a-a327-11e5-877f-687dc1f90e27.png\n\nToolbar Options\n---------------\n\nThe aws-shell has a bottom toolbar that provides several options:\n\n* ``F2`` toggles between fuzzy and substring matching\n* ``F3`` toggles between VI and Emacs key bindings\n* ``F4`` toggles between single and multi column auto completions\n* ``F5`` shows and hides the help documentation pane\n* ``F9`` toggles focus between the cli and documentation pane\n* ``F10`` or ``Ctrl-D`` exits the aws-shell\n\nAs you toggle options in the toolbar, your preferences are persisted\nto the ``~/.aws/shell/awsshellrc`` file so that the next time you run\nthe aws-shell, your preferences will be restored.\n\n.. image:: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/368057/11823907/8c3f1e60-a32b-11e5-9f99-fe504ea0a5dc.png\n\nDot Commands\n------------\n\nThe aws-shell provides additional commands specific to the aws-shell.\nThe commands are available by adding the ``.`` prefix before a command.\n\nExiting the Shell\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nYou can run the ``.exit`` or ``.quit`` commands to exit the shell.\n\nCreating Shell Scripts with .edit\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThere are times when you may want to take a sequence of commands\nyou\'ve run in the aws-shell and combine them into a shell script.\nIn addition to the command history that\'s persisted to the\nhistory file, the aws-shell also keeps track of all the commands\nyou\'ve run since you first started your aws-shell session.\n\nYou can run the ``.edit`` command to open all these commands in\nan editor.  The aws-shell will use the ``EDITOR`` environment\nvariable before defaulting to ``notepad`` on Windows and\n``vi`` on other platforms.\n\n::\n\n    aws> ec2 describe-instances\n    aws> dynamodb list-tables\n    aws> .edit\n\nChanging Profiles with .profile\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can change the current AWS CLI profile used by the aws-shell\nby using the ``.profile`` dot command.  If you run the ``.profile``\ncommand with no arguments, the currently configured shell profile\nwill be printed.\n\n::\n\n    aws> .profile demo\n    Current shell profile changed to: demo\n    aws> .profile\n    Current shell profile: demo\n\n\n.cd\n~~~\n\nYou can change the current working directory of the aws-shell by using\nthe ``.cd`` command::\n\n    aws> !pwd\n    /usr\n    aws> .cd /tmp\n    aws> !pwd\n    /tmp\n\n\nExecuting Shell Commands\n------------------------\n\nThe aws-shell integrates with other commands in several ways.\nFirst, you can pipe AWS CLI commands to other processes as well\nas redirect output to a file::\n\n    aws> dynamodb list-tables --output text | head -n 1\n    TABLENAMES     First\n    aws> dynamodb list-tables --output text > /tmp/foo.txt\n\nSecond, if you want to run a shell command rather than an AWS CLI\ncommand, you can add the ``!`` prefix to your command::\n\n    aws> !ls /tmp/\n    foo.txt                                    bar.txt\n\nDeveloper Preview Status\n========================\n\nThe aws-shell is currently in developer preview.\nWe welcome feedback, feature requests, and bug reports.\nThere may be backwards incompatible changes made in order\nto respond to customer feedback as we continue to iterate\non the aws-shell.\n\n\nMore Information\n================\n\nBelow are miscellaneous links for more information:\n\n* `AWS CLI Reference Docs`_\n* `AWS CLI User Guide`_\n* `AWS CLI Blog`_\n* `AWS CLI Github Repo`_\n\n.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/\n.. _AWS CLI Getting Started Guide: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html\n.. _boto3: https://github.com/boto/boto3\n.. _AWS CLI Reference Docs: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/\n.. _AWS CLI User Guide: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/\n.. _AWS CLI Blog: https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/cli/\n.. _AWS CLI Github Repo: https://github.com/aws/aws-cli\n'
