b'dev-setup\n============\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/repo-header.gif">\n</p>\n\n## Motivation\n\nSetting up a new developer machine can be an **ad-hoc, manual, and time-consuming** process.  `dev-setup` aims to **simplify** the process with **easy-to-understand instructions** and **dotfiles/scripts** to **automate the setup** of the following:\n\n* **OS X updates and Xcode Command Line Tools**\n* **OS X defaults** geared towards developers\n* **Developer tools**: Vim, bash, tab completion, curl, git, GNU core utils, Python, Ruby, etc\n* **Developer apps**: iTerm2, Sublime Text, Atom, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker, Chrome, etc\n* **Python data analysis**: IPython Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc\n* **Big Data platforms**: Spark (with IPython Notebook integration) and MapReduce\n* **Cloud services**: Amazon Web Services (Boto, AWS CLI, S3cmd, etc) and Heroku\n* **Common data stores**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch\n* **Javascript web development**: Node.js, JSHint, and Less\n* **Android development**: Java, Android SDK, Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA\n\n### But...I Don\'t Need All These Tools!\n\n**`dev-setup` is geared to be more of an organized *reference* of various developer tools.**\n\n**You\'re *not* meant to install everything.**\n\nIf you\'re interested in automation, `dev-setup` provides a customizable [setup script](#single-setup-script).  There\'s really no one-size-fits-all solution for developers so you\'re encouraged to make tweaks to suit your needs.\n\n[Credits](#credits): This repo builds on the awesome work from [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) and [Nicolas Hery](https://github.com/nicolashery).\n\n### For Automation, What About Vagrant, Docker, or Boxen?\n\n[Vagrant](#vagrant) and [Docker](#docker) are great tools and are set up by this repo. I\'ve found that Vagrant works well to ensure dev matches up with test and production tiers. I\'ve only started playing around with Docker for side projects and it looks very promising. However, for Mac users, Docker and Vagrant both rely on **virtual machines**, which have their own considerations/pros/cons.\n\n[Boxen](https://boxen.github.com/) is a cool solution, although some might find it better geared towards "more mature companies or devops teams". I\'ve seen some discussions of [difficulties as it is using Puppet under the hood](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/issues/742).\n\nThis repo takes a more **light-weight** approach to automation using a combination of **Homebrew, Homebrew Cask, and shell scripts** to do basic system setup.  It also provides **easy-to understand instructions** for installation, configuration, and usage for each developer app or tool.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/iterm2.png">\n</p>\n\n### Sections Summary\n* Section 1 contains the dotfiles/scripts and instructions to set up your system.\n* Sections 2 through 7 detail more information about installation, configuration, and usage for topics in Section 1.\n\n## Section 1: Installation\n\n**Scripts tested on OS X 10.10 Yosemite and 10.11 El Capitan.**\n\n* [Single Setup Script](#single-setup-script)\n* [bootstrap.sh script](#bootstrapsh-script)\n    * Syncs dev-setup to your local home directory `~`\n* [osxprep.sh script](#osxprepsh-script)\n    * Updates OS X and installs Xcode command line tools\n* [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script)\n    * Installs common Homebrew formulae and apps\n* [osx.sh script](#osxsh-script)\n    * Sets up OS X defaults geared towards developers\n* [pydata.sh script](#pydatash-script)\n    * Sets up python for data analysis\n* [aws.sh script](#awssh-script)\n    * Sets up Spark, Hadoop MapReduce, and Amazon Web Services\n* [datastores.sh script](#datastoressh-script)\n    * Sets up common data stores\n* [web.sh script](#websh-script)\n    * Sets up JavaScript web development\n* [android.sh script](#androidsh-script)\n    * Sets up Android development\n\n## Section 2: General Apps and Tools\n\n* [Sublime Text](#sublime-text)\n* [Atom](#atom)\n* [Terminal Customization](#terminal-customization)\n* [iTerm2](#iterm2)\n* [Vim](#vim)\n* [Git](#git)\n* [VirtualBox](#virtualbox)\n* [Vagrant](#vagrant)\n* [Docker](#docker)\n* [Homebrew](#homebrew)\n* [Ruby and rbenv](#ruby-and-rbenv)\n* [Python](#python)\n* [Pip](#pip)\n* [Virtualenv](#virtualenv)\n* [Virtualenvwrapper](#virtualenvwrapper)\n\n## Section 3: Python Data Analysis\n\n* [Anaconda](#anaconda)\n* [IPython Notebook](#ipython-notebook)\n* [NumPy](#numpy)\n* [Pandas](#pandas)\n* [Matplotlib](#matplotlib)\n* [Seaborn](#seaborn)\n* [Scikit-learn](#scikit-learn)\n* [SciPy](#scipy)\n* [Flask](#flask)\n* [Bokeh](#bokeh)\n\n## Section 4: Big Data, AWS, and Heroku\n\n* [Spark](#spark)\n* [MapReduce](#mapreduce)\n* [Awesome AWS](#awesome-aws-)\n* [AWS Account](#aws-account)\n* [AWS CLI](#aws-cli)\n* [SAWS](#saws)\n* [Boto](#boto)\n* [S3cmd](#s3cmd)\n* [S3DistCp](#s3distcp)\n* [S3-parallel-put](#s3-parallel-put)\n* [Redshift](#redshift)\n* [Kinesis](#kinesis)\n* [Lambda](#lambda)\n* [AWS Machine Learning](#aws-machine-learning)\n* [Heroku](#heroku)\n\n## Section 5: Data Stores\n\n* [MySQL](#mysql)\n* [MySQL Workbench](#mysql-workbench)\n* [MongoDB](#mongodb)\n* [Redis](#redis)\n* [Elasticsearch](#elasticsearch)\n\n## Section 6: JavaScript Web Development\n\n* [Node.js](#nodejs)\n* [JSHint](#jshint)\n* [Less](#less)\n\n## Section 7: Android Development\n\n* [Java](#java)\n* [Android SDK](#android-sdk)\n* [Android Studio](#android-studio)\n* [IntelliJ IDEA](#intellij-idea)\n\n## Section 8: Misc\n\n* [Contributions](#contributions)\n* [Credits](#credits)\n* [Contact Info](#contact-info)\n* [License](#license)\n\n## Section 1: Installation\n\n### Single Setup Script\n\n#### Running with Git\n\n##### Clone the Repo\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup.git && cd dev-setup\n\n##### Run the .dots Script with Command Line Arguments\n\n**Since you probably don\'t want to install every section**, the `.dots` script supports command line arguments to run only specified sections.  Simply pass in the [scripts](#scripts) that you want to install.  Below are some examples.\n\n**For more customization, you can [clone](#clone-the-repo) or [fork](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/fork) the repo and tweak the `.dots` script and its associated components to suit your needs.**\n\nRun all:\n\n    $ ./.dots all\n\nRun `bootstrap.sh`, `osxprep.sh`, `brew.sh`, and `osx.sh`:\n\n    $ ./.dots bootstrap osxprep brew osx\n\nRun `bootstrap.sh`, `osxprep.sh`, `brew.sh`, and `osx.sh`, `pydata.sh`, `aws.sh`, and `datastores.sh`:\n\n    $ ./.dots bootstrap osxprep brew osx pydata aws datastores\n\n#### Running without Git\n\n    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/master/.dots && ./.dots [Add ARGS Here]\n\n#### Scripts\n\n* [.dots](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/.dots)\n    * Runs specified scripts\n* [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/bootstrap.sh)\n    * Syncs dev-setup to your local home directory `~`\n* [osxprep.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/osxprep.sh)\n    * Updates OS X and installs Xcode command line tools\n* [brew.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/brew.sh)\n    * Installs common Homebrew formulae and apps\n* [osx.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/osx.sh)\n    * Sets up OS X defaults geared towards developers\n* [pydata.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/pydata.sh)\n    * Sets up python for data analysis\n* [aws.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/aws.sh)\n    * Sets up Spark, Hadoop MapReduce, and Amazon Web Services\n* [datastores.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/datastores.sh)\n    * Sets up common data stores\n* [web.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/web.sh)\n    * Sets up JavaScript web development\n* [android.sh](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/android.sh)\n    * Sets up Android development\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* `.dots` will initially prompt you to enter your password.\n* `.dots` might ask you to re-enter your password at certain stages of the installation.\n* If OS X updates require a restart, simply run `.dots` again to resume where you left off.\n* When installing the Xcode command line tools, a dialog box will confirm installation.\n    * Once Xcode is installed, follow the instructions on the terminal to continue.\n* `.dots` runs `brew.sh`, which takes awhile to complete as some formulae need to be installed from source.\n* **When `.dots` completes, be sure to restart your computer for all updates to take effect.**\n\nI encourage you to read through Section 1 so you have a better idea of what each installation script does.  The following discussions describe in greater detail what is executed when running the [.dots](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/.dots) script.\n\n### bootstrap.sh script\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/commands.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nThe `bootstrap.sh` script will sync the dev-setup repo to your local home directory.  This will include customizations for Vim, bash, curl, git, tab completion, aliases, a number of utility functions, etc.  Section 2 of this repo describes some of the customizations.\n\n#### Running with Git\n\nFirst, fork or [clone the repo](#clone-the-repo).  The `bootstrap.sh` script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder `~`:\n\n    $ source bootstrap.sh\n\nTo update later on, just run that command again.\n\nAlternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:\n\n    $ set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh\n\n#### Running without Git\n\nTo sync dev-setup to your local home directory without Git, run the following:\n\n    $ cd ~; curl -#L https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh,LICENSE}\n\nTo update later on, just run that command again.\n\n#### Optional: Specify PATH\n\nIf `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files before any feature testing (such as detecting which version of `ls` is being used takes place.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"\n```\n\n#### Optional: Add Custom Commands\n\nIf `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to commit to a public repository.\n\nMy `~/.extra` looks something like this:\n\n```bash\n# Git credentials\nGIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Donne Martin"\nGIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"\ngit config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"\nGIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="donne.martin@gmail.com"\nGIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"\ngit config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"\n\n# Pip should only run if there is a virtualenv currently activated\nexport PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true\n\n# Install or upgrade a global package\n# Usage: gpip install \xe2\x80\x93upgrade pip setuptools virtualenv\ngpip(){\n   PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV="" pip "$@"\n}\n```\n\nYou could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions, and aliases from the dev-setup repository, although it\xe2\x80\x99s probably better to [fork the dev-setup repository](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/fork).\n\n### osxprep.sh script\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/xcode.jpg">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nRun the `osxprep.sh` script:\n\n    $ ./osxprep.sh\n\n`osxprep.sh` will first install all updates.  If a restart is required, simply run the script again.  Once all updates are installed, `osxprep.sh` will then [Install Xcode Command Line Tools](#install-xcode-command-line-tools).\n\nIf you want to go the manual route, you can also install all updates by running "App Store", selecting the "Updates" icon, then updating both the OS and installed apps.\n\n#### Install Xcode Command Line Tools\n\nAn important dependency before many tools such as Homebrew can work is the **Command Line Tools for Xcode**. These include compilers like gcc that will allow you to build from source.\n\nIf you are running **OS X 10.9 Mavericks or later**, then you can install the Xcode Command Line Tools directly from the command line with:\n\n    $ xcode-select --install\n\n**Note**: the `osxprep.sh` script executes this command.\n\nRunning the command above will display a dialog where you can either:\n* Install Xcode and the command line tools\n* Install the command line tools only\n* Cancel the install\n\n##### OS X 10.8 and Older\n\nIf you\'re running 10.8 or older, you\'ll need to go to [http://developer.apple.com/downloads](http://developer.apple.com/downloads), and sign in with your Apple ID (the same one you use for iTunes and app purchases). Unfortunately, you\'re greeted by a rather annoying questionnaire. All questions are required, so feel free to answer at random.\n\nOnce you reach the downloads page, search for "command line tools", and download the latest **Command Line Tools (OS X Mountain Lion) for Xcode**. Open the **.dmg** file once it\'s done downloading, and double-click on the **.mpkg** installer to launch the installation. When it\'s done, you can unmount the disk in Finder.\n\n### brew.sh script\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/homebrew2.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nWhen setting up a new Mac, you may want to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), a package manager that simplifies installing and updating applications or libraries.\n\nSome of the apps installed by the `brew.sh` script include: Chrome, Firefox, Sublime Text, Atom, Dropbox, Evernote, Skype, Slack, Alfred, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker, etc.  **For a full listing of installed formulae and apps, refer to the commented [brew.sh source file](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/brew.sh) directly and tweak it to suit your needs.**\n\nRun the `brew.sh` script:\n\n    $ ./brew.sh\n\nThe `brew.sh` script takes awhile to complete, as some formulae need to be installed from source.\n\n**For your terminal customization to take full effect, quit and re-start the terminal**\n\n### osx.sh script\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/osx.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nWhen setting up a new Mac, you may want to set OS X defaults geared towards developers.  The `osx.sh` script also configures common third-party apps such Sublime Text and Chrome.\n\n**Note**: **I strongly encourage you read through the commented [osx.sh source file](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/osx.sh) and tweak any settings based on your personal preferences.  The script defaults are intended for you to customize.**  For example, if you are not running an SSD you might want to change some of the settings listed in the SSD section.\n\nRun the `osx.sh` script:\n\n    $ ./osx.sh\n\n**For your terminal customization to take full effect, quit and re-start the terminal.**\n\n### pydata.sh script\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/pydata.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nTo set up a development environment to work with Python and data analysis without relying on the more heavyweight [Anaconda](#anaconda) distribution, run the `pydata.sh` script:\n\n    $ ./pydata.sh\n\nThis will install [Virtualenv](#virtualenv) and [Virtualenvwrapper](#virtualenvwrapper).  It will then set up two virtual environments loaded with the packages you will need to work with data in Python 2 and Python 3.\n\nTo switch to the Python 2 virtual environment, run the following Virtualenvwrapper command:\n\n    $ workon py2-data\n\nTo switch to the Python 3 virtual environment, run the following Virtualenvwrapper command:\n\n    $ workon py3-data\n\nThen start working with the installed packages, for example:\n\n    $ ipython notebook\n\n[Section 3: Python Data Analysis](#section-3-python-data-analysis) describes the installed packages and usage.\n\n### aws.sh script\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/aws.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nTo set up a development environment to work with Spark, Hadoop MapReduce, and Amazon Web Services, run the `aws.sh` script:\n\n    $ ./aws.sh\n\n[Section 4: Big Data, AWS, and Heroku](#section-4-big-data-aws-and-heroku) describes the installed packages and usage.\n\n### datastores.sh script\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/datastores.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nTo set up common data stores, run the `datastores.sh` script:\n\n    $ ./datastores.sh\n\n[Section 5: Data Stores](#section-5-data-stores) describes the installed packages and usage.\n\n### web.sh script\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/webdev.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nTo set up a JavaScript web development environment, Run the `web.sh` script:\n\n    $ ./web.sh\n\n[Section 6: Web Development](#section-6-web-development) describes the installed packages and usage.\n\n### android.sh script\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/android.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nTo set up an Android development environment, run the `android.sh` script:\n\n    $ ./android.sh\n\n[Section 7: Android Development](#section-7-android-development) describes the installed packages and usage.\n\n## Section 2: General Apps and Tools\n\n### Sublime Text\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/sublime.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nWith the terminal, the text editor is a developer\'s most important tool. Everyone has their preferences, but unless you\'re a hardcore [Vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) user, a lot of people are going to tell you that [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is currently the best one out there.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Sublime Text.\n\nIf you prefer to install it separately, go ahead and [download](http://www.sublimetext.com/) it. Open the **.dmg** file, drag-and-drop in the **Applications** folder.\n\n**Note**: At this point I\'m going to create a shortcut on the OS X Dock for both for Sublime Text. To do so, right-click on the running application and select **Options > Keep in Dock**.\n\nSublime Text is not free, but I think it has an unlimited "evaluation period". Anyhow, we\'re going to be using it so much that even the seemingly expensive $70 price tag is worth every penny. If you can afford it, I suggest you [support](http://www.sublimetext.com/buy) this awesome tool.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nThe [osx.sh script](#osxsh-script) contains Sublime Text configurations.\n\n#### Soda Theme\n\nThe [Soda Theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme) is a great UI theme for Sublime Text, especially if you use a dark theme and think the side bar sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\n##### Installation with Sublime Package Control\n\nIf you are using Will Bond\'s excellent [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you can easily install Soda Theme via the `Package Control: Install Package` menu item. The Soda Theme package is listed as `Theme - Soda` in the packages list.\n\n##### Installation with Git\n\nAlternatively, if you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text application settings area.\n\nYou can locate your Sublime Text `Packages` directory by using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.\n\nWhile inside the `Packages` directory, clone the theme repository using the command below:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/ "Theme - Soda"\n\n##### Activating the Theme on Sublime Text 2\n\n* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`\n* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme"` or `"theme": "Soda Dark.sublime-theme"`\n\n**Example Sublime Text 2 User Settings**\n\n    {\n        "theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme"\n    }\n\n##### Activating the Theme on Sublime Text 3\n\n* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User`\n* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Soda Light 3.sublime-theme"` or `"theme": "Soda Dark 3.sublime-theme"`\n\n**Example Sublime Text 3 User Settings**\n\n    {\n        "theme": "Soda Light 3.sublime-theme"\n    }\n\n##### Changing Monokai Comment Color\n\nAlthough Monokai is a great color scheme, I find that comments can be difficult to see.  You can follow these [instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32686509) to change the color of the default theme.\n\nI set my comments color to `#E6DB74`.\n\n```\n<dict>\n    ...\n    <dict>\n        <key>foreground</key>\n        <string>#E6DB74</string>\n    </dict>\n    ...\n</dict>\n```\n\n### Atom\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/atom.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\n[Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) is a great open-source editor from GitHub that is rapidly gaining contributors and popularity.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Atom.\n\nIf you prefer to install it separately, [download](https://atom.io/) it, open the **.dmg** file, drag-and-drop in the **Applications** folder.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nAtom has a great package manager that allows you to easily install both core and community packages.\n\n### Terminal Customization\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/terminal.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nSince we spend so much time in the terminal, we should try to make it a more pleasant and colorful place.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nThe [bootstrap.sh script](#bootstrapsh-script) and [osx.sh script](#osxsh-script) contain terminal customizations.\n\n### iTerm2\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/iterm2.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nI prefer iTerm2 over the stock Terminal, as it has some additional [great features](https://www.iterm2.com/features.html). Download and install iTerm2 (the newest version, even if it says "beta release").\n\nIn Finder, drag and drop the iTerm Application file into the Applications folder.\n\nYou can now launch iTerm, through the Launchpad for instance.\n\nLet\'s just quickly change some preferences. In iTerm > Preferences..., in the tab Profiles, create a new one with the "+" icon, and rename it to your first name for example. Then, select Other Actions... > Set as Default. Under the section Window, change the size to something better, like Columns: 125 and Rows: 35.  I also like to set General > Working Directory > Reuse previous session\'s directory.  Finally, I change the way the option key works so that I can quickly jump between words as described [here](https://coderwall.com/p/h6yfda/use-and-to-jump-forwards-backwards-words-in-iterm-2-on-os-x).\n\nWhen done, hit the red "X" in the upper left (saving is automatic in OS X preference panes). Close the window and open a new one to see the size change.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nSince we spend so much time in the terminal, we should try to make it a more pleasant and colorful place. What follows might seem like a lot of work, but trust me, it\'ll make the development experience so much better.\n\nNow let\'s add some color. I\'m a big fan of the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme. It is supposed to be scientifically optimal for the eyes. I just find it pretty.\n\n- In **iTerm2 Preferences**, under **Profiles** and **Colors**, go to **Load Presets...** and select **Solarized Dark** to activate it. Voila!\n\nAt this point you can also change your computer\'s name, which shows up in this terminal prompt. If you want to do so, go to **System Preferences** > **Sharing**. For example, I changed mine from "Donne\'s MacBook Pro" to just "MacBook Pro", so it shows up as `MacBook-Pro` in the terminal.\n\nNow we have a terminal we can work with!\n\n### Vim\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/vim.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nAlthough Sublime Text will be our main editor, it is a good idea to learn some very basic usage of [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). It is a very popular text editor inside the terminal, and is usually pre-installed on any Unix system.\n\nFor example, when you run a Git commit, it will open Vim to allow you to type the commit message.\n\nI suggest you read a tutorial on Vim. Grasping the concept of the two "modes" of the editor, **Insert** (by pressing `i`) and **Normal** (by pressing `Esc` to exit Insert mode), will be the part that feels most unnatural. After that it\'s just remembering a few important keys.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nThe [bootstrap.sh script](#bootstrapsh-script) contains Vim customizations.\n\n### VirtualBox\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/virtualbox.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nVirtualBox creates and manages virtual machines.  It\'s a solid free solution to its commercial rival VMware.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs VirtualBox\n\nIf you prefer to install it separately, you can download it [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or run:\n\n    $ brew update\n    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask\n    $ brew cask install --appdir="/Applications" virtualbox\n\n### Vagrant\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/vagrant.jpeg">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nVagrant creates and configures development environments.  You can think of it as a higher-level wrapper around VirtualBox and configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and Salt.  Vagrant also supports Docker containers and server environments like Amazon EC2.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Vagrant.\n\nIf you prefer to install it separately, you can download it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or run:\n\n    $ brew update\n    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask\n    $ brew cask install --appdir="/Applications" vagrant\n\n### Docker\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/docker.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nDocker automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.  I think the following [quote](http://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/cloud-computing/731454-docker-a-shipping-container-for-linux-code) explains docker nicely: "Docker is a tool that can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux server. This helps enable flexibility and portability on where the application can run, whether on premise, public cloud, private cloud, bare metal, etc".\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Docker.\n\nIf you prefer to install it separately, you can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/) or run:\n\n    $ brew update\n    $ brew install docker\n    $ brew install boot2docker\n\n#### Configuration\n\nInitialize and start `boot2docker` (only need to do this once):\n\n    $ boot2docker init\n\nStart the VM:\n\n    $ boot2docker up\n\nSet the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable and fill in IP and PORT based on the output from the `boot2coker up` command:\n\n    $ export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://IP:PORT\n\n### Git\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/git.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nWhat\'s a developer without [Git](http://git-scm.com/)?\n\n#### Installation\n\nGit should have been installed when you ran through the [Install Xcode Command Line Tools](#install-xcode-command-line-tools) section.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nTo check your version of Git, run the following command:\n\n    $ git --version\n\nAnd `$ which git` should output `/usr/local/bin/git`.\n\nLet\'s set up some basic configuration. Download the [.gitconfig](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/master/.gitconfig) file to your home directory:\n\n    $ cd ~\n    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/master/.gitconfig\n\nIt will add some color to the `status`, `branch`, and `diff` Git commands, as well as a couple aliases. Feel free to take a look at the contents of the file, and add to it to your liking.\n\nNext, we\'ll define your Git user (should be the same name and email you use for [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)):\n\n    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"\n    $ git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"\n\nThey will get added to your `.gitconfig` file.\n\nTo push code to your GitHub repositories, we\'re going to use the recommended HTTPS method (versus SSH). So you don\'t have to type your username and password everytime, let\'s enable Git password caching as described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git):\n\n    $ git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain\n\n**Note**: On a Mac, it is important to remember to add `.DS_Store` (a hidden OS X system file that\'s put in folders) to your `.gitignore` files. You can take a look at this repository\'s [.gitignore](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/.gitignore) file for inspiration.  Also check out GitHub\'s [collection of .gitignore templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore).\n\n### Homebrew\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/homebrew.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nPackage managers make it so much easier to install and update applications (for Operating Systems) or libraries (for programming languages). The most popular one for OS X is [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Homebrew and a number of useful Homebrew formulae and apps.\n\nIf you prefer to install it separately, run the following command and follow the steps on the screen:\n\n    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"\n\n#### Usage\n\nTo install a package (or **Formula** in Homebrew vocabulary) simply type:\n\n    $ brew install <formula>\n\nTo update Homebrew\'s directory of formulae, run:\n\n    $ brew update\n\n**Note**: I\'ve seen that command fail sometimes because of a bug. If that ever happens, run the following (when you have Git installed):\n\n    $ cd /usr/local\n    $ git fetch origin\n    $ git reset --hard origin/master\n\nTo see if any of your packages need to be updated:\n\n    $ brew outdated\n\nTo update a package:\n\n    $ brew upgrade <formula>\n\nHomebrew keeps older versions of packages installed, in case you want to roll back. That rarely is necessary, so you can do some cleanup to get rid of those old versions:\n\n    $ brew cleanup\n\nTo see what you have installed (with their version numbers):\n\n    $ brew list --versions\n\n### Ruby and rbenv\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/ruby.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\n[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) is already installed on Unix systems, but we don\'t want to mess around with that installation. More importantly, we want to be able to use the latest version of Ruby.\n\n#### Installation\n\n`brew.sh` provides [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) which allow you to manage multiple versions of Ruby on the same machine.  `brew.sh` adds the following line to your `.extra` file to initialize `rbenv`:\n\n```\neval "$(rbenv init -)"\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\n`rbenv` uses `ruby-build` to download, compile, and install new versions of Ruby. You can see all versions available to download and install:\n\n```\n$ ruby-build --definitions\n```\n\nTo install a new version of Ruby:\n\n```\n# list all available versions installed on the system:\n$ rbenv install -l\n\n# install a Ruby version:\n$ rbenv install 2.2.3\n```\n\nTo switch Ruby versions:\n\n```\n# set a local application-specific Ruby version in the current directory\n$ rbenv local 1.9.3\n\n# set the global version of Ruby to be used in all shells\n$ rbenv global 2.0.0\n\n```\n\n`rbenv` by default will install Ruby versions into a directory of the same name under `~/.rbenv/versions`. Because your user owns this directory, you no longer need to use `sudo` to install gems.\n\n### Python\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/python.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nOS X, like Linux, ships with [Python](http://python.org/) already installed. But you don\'t want to mess with the system Python (some system tools rely on it, etc.), so we\'ll install our own version with Homebrew. It will also allow us to get the very latest version of Python 2.7 and Python 3.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs the latest versions of Python 2 and Python 3.\n\n### Pip\n\n[Pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) is the Python package manager.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [pydata.sh script](#pydatash-script) installs pip.\n\n#### Usage\n\nHere are a couple Pip commands to get you started. To install a Python package:\n\n    $ pip install <package>\n\nTo upgrade a package:\n\n    $ pip install --upgrade <package>\n\nTo see what\'s installed:\n\n    $ pip freeze\n\nTo uninstall a package:\n\n    $ pip uninstall <package>\n\n### Virtualenv\n\n[Virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/) is a tool that creates an isolated Python environment for each of your projects. For a particular project, instead of installing required packages globally, it is best to install them in an isolated folder in the project (say a folder named `venv`), that will be managed by virtualenv.\n\nThe advantage is that different projects might require different versions of packages, and it would be hard to manage that if you install packages globally. It also allows you to keep your global `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages` folder clean.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [pydata.sh script](#pydatash-script) installs Virtualenv.\n\n#### Usage\n\nLet\'s say you have a project in a directory called `myproject`. To set up virtualenv for that project:\n\n    $ cd myproject/\n    $ virtualenv venv --distribute\n\nIf you want your virtualenv to also inherit globally installed packages (like IPython or Numpy mentioned above), use:\n\n    $ virtualenv venv --distribute --system-site-packages\n\nThese commands create a `venv` subdirectory in your project where everything is installed. You need to **activate** it first though (in every terminal where you are working on your project):\n\n    $ source venv/bin/activate\n\nYou should see a `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt indicating that you are working inside the virtualenv. Now when you install something:\n\n    $ pip install <package>\n\nIt will get installed in the `venv` folder, and not conflict with other projects.\n\n**Important**: Remember to add `venv` to your project\'s `.gitignore` file so you don\'t include all of that in your source code!\n\n### Virtualenvwrapper\n\n[Virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is a set of extensions that includes wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their dependencies.\n\nMain features include:\n\n* Organizes all of your virtual environments in one place.\n* Wrappers for managing your virtual environments (create, delete, copy).\n* Use a single command to switch between environments.\n* Tab completion for commands that take a virtual environment as argument.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [pydata.sh script](#pydatash-script) installs Virtualenvwrapper.\n\n#### Usage\n\nCreate a new virtual environment. When you create a new environment it automatically becomes the active environment:\n\n    $ mkvirtualenv [env name]\n\nRemove an existing virtual environment. The environment must be deactivated (see below) before it can be removed:\n\n    $ rmvirtualenv [env name]\n\nActivate a virtual environment. Will also list all existing virtual environments if no argument is passed:\n\n    $ workon [env name]\n\nDeactivate the currently active virtual environment. Note that workonwill automatically deactivate the current environment before activating a new one:\n\n    $ deactivate\n\n## Section 3: Python Data Analysis\n\n### Anaconda\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/anaconda.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nAnaconda is a free distribution of the Python programming language for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing that aims to simplify package management and deployment.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [pydata.sh script](#pydatash-script) installs packages you need to run Python data applications.

However, sometimes I just want to hack away at a command line to do my work.\n\nI\'ve found S3cmd to be a great command line tool for interacting with S3 on AWS.  S3cmd is written in Python, is open source, and is free even for commercial use.  It offers more advanced features than those found in the [AWS CLI](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/).\n\n#### Installation\n\n**S3cmd is Python 2 only.**\n\nThe [aws.sh script](#aws-script) installs s3cmd.  If you prefer to install it separately, run:\n\n    $ pip install s3cmd\n\nRunning the following command will prompt you to enter your AWS access and AWS secret keys. To follow security best practices, make sure you are using an IAM account as opposed to using the root account.\n\nI also suggest enabling GPG encryption which will encrypt your data at rest, and enabling HTTPS to encrypt your data in transit. Note this might impact performance.\n\n    $ s3cmd --configure\n\nAlternatively, the aws.sh script also syncs the template ```.s3cfg``` file to your home folder.  Note running the aws.sh script will overwrite any existing ```~/.s3cfg``` file.  Update the config file with your credentials and location:\n\n```\n[Credentials]\naws_access_key_id = YOURACCESSKEY\naws_secret_access_key = YOURSECRETKEY\n...\nbucket_location = US\n...\ngpg_passphrase = YOURPASSPHRASE\n```\n\n**Be careful you do not accidentally check in your credentials.**  The .gitignore file is set to ignore files with credentials.\n\n#### Usage\n\nRefer to the following [s3cmd IPython Notebook](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks#aws).\n\n### S3DistCp\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/s3distcp.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\n[S3DistCp](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingEMR_s3distcp.html) is an extension of DistCp that is optimized to work with Amazon S3.  S3DistCp is useful for combining smaller files and aggregate them together, taking in a pattern and target file to combine smaller input files to larger ones.  S3DistCp can also be used to transfer large volumes of data from S3 to your Hadoop cluster.\n\n#### Installation\n\nS3DistCp comes bundled with the AWS CLI.\n\n#### Usage\n\nRefer to the following [S3DistCp IPython Notebook](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks#aws).\n\n### S3-parallel-put\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/s3-parallel-put.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\n[s3-parallel-put](https://github.com/twpayne/s3-parallel-put.git) is a great tool for uploading multiple files to S3 in parallel.\n\n#### Installation\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/twpayne/s3-parallel-put.git\n\n#### Usage\n\nRefer to the following [s3-parallel-put IPython Notebook](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks#aws).\n\n### Redshift\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/aws_redshift.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nRedshift is a fast data warehouse built on top of technology from massive parallel processing (MPP).\n\n#### Setup\n\nFollow these [instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/rs-gsg-prereq.html).\n\n#### Usage\n\nRefer to the following [Redshift IPython Notebook](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks#aws).\n\n### Kinesis\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/aws_kinesis.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nKinesis streams data in real time with the ability to process thousands of data streams per second.\n\n#### Setup\n\nFollow these [instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/before-you-begin.html).\n\n#### Usage\n\nRefer to the following [Kinesis IPython Notebook](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks#aws).\n\n### Lambda\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/aws_lambda.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nLambda runs code in response to events, automatically managing compute resources.\n\n#### Setup\n\nFollow these [instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/setting-up.html).\n\n#### Usage\n\nRefer to the following [Lambda IPython Notebook](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks#aws).\n\n### AWS Machine Learning\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/aws_ml.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nAmazon Machine Learning is a service that makes it easy for developers of all skill levels to use machine learning technology. Amazon Machine Learning provides visualization tools and wizards that guide you through the process of creating machine learning (ML) models without having to learn complex ML algorithms and technology. Once your models are ready, Amazon Machine Learning makes it easy to obtain predictions for your application using simple APIs, without having to implement custom prediction generation code, or manage any infrastructure.\n\n#### Setup\n\nFollow these [instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/setting_up.html).\n\n#### Usage\n\n[Coming Soon] Refer to the following [AWS Machine Learning IPython Notebook](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks#aws).\n\n### Heroku\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/heroku.jpg">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\n[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/), if you\'re not already familiar with it, is a [Platform-as-a-Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) (PaaS) that makes it really easy to deploy your apps online. There are other similar solutions out there, but Heroku was among the first and is currently the most popular. Not only does it make a developer\'s life easier, but I find that having Heroku deployment in mind when building an app forces you to follow modern app development [best practices](http://www.12factor.net/).\n\n#### Installation\n\nAssuming that you have an account (sign up if you don\'t), let\'s install the [Heroku Client](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-the-cli) for the command-line. Heroku offers a Mac OS X installer, the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/), that includes the client. But for these kind of tools, I prefer using Homebrew. It allows us to keep better track of what we have installed. Luckily for us, Homebrew includes a `heroku-toolbelt` formula:\n\n    $ brew install heroku-toolbelt\n\nThe formula might not have the latest version of the Heroku Client, which is updated pretty often. Let\'s update it now:\n\n    $ brew upgrade heroku-toolbelt\n\nDon\'t be afraid to run `heroku update` every now and then to always have the most recent version.\n\n#### Usage\n\nLogin to your Heroku account using your email and password:\n\n    $ heroku login\n\nIf this is a new account, and since you don\'t already have a public **SSH key** in your `~/.ssh` directory, it will offer to create one for you. Say yes! It will also upload the key to your Heroku account, which will allow you to deploy apps from this computer.\n\nIf it didn\'t offer create the SSH key for you (i.e. your Heroku account already has SSH keys associated with it), you can do so manually by running:\n\n     $ mkdir ~/.ssh\n     $ ssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nKeep the default file name and skip the passphrase by just hitting Enter both times. Then, add the key to your Heroku account:\n\n    $ heroku keys:add\n\nOnce the key business is done, you\'re ready to deploy apps! Heroku has a great [Getting Started](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python) guide, so I\'ll let you refer to that (the one linked here is for Python, but there is one for every popular language). Heroku uses Git to push code for deployment, so make sure your app is under Git version control. A quick cheat sheet (if you\'ve used Heroku before):\n\n    $ cd myapp/\n    $ heroku create myapp\n    $ git push heroku master\n    $ heroku ps\n    $ heroku logs -t\n\nThe [Heroku Dev Center](https://devcenter.heroku.com/) is full of great resources, so be sure to check it out!\n\n## Section 5: Data Stores\n\n### MySQL\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/mysql.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [datastores.sh script](#datastoressh-script) installs MySQL.  If you prefer to install it separately, run:\n\n    $ brew update # Always good to do\n    $ brew install mysql\n\nAs you can see in the ouput from Homebrew, before we can use MySQL we first need to set it up with:\n\n    $ unset TMPDIR\n    $ mkdir /usr/local/var\n    $ mysql_install_db --verbose --user=`whoami` --basedir="$(brew --prefix mysql)" --datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql --tmpdir=/tmp\n\n#### Usage\n\nTo start the MySQL server, use the `mysql.server` tool:\n\n    $ mysql.server start\n\nTo stop it when you are done, run:\n\n    $ mysql.server stop\n\nYou can see the different commands available for `mysql.server` with:\n\n    $ mysql.server --help\n\nTo connect with the command-line client, run:\n\n    $ mysql -uroot\n\n(Use `exit` to quit the MySQL shell.)\n\n**Note**: By default, the MySQL user `root` has no password. It doesn\'t really matter for a local development database. If you wish to change it though, you can use `$ mysqladmin -u root password \'new-password\'`.\n\n### MySQL Workbench\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/mysql_workbench.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nIn terms of a GUI client for MySQL, I\'m used to the official and free [MySQL Workbench](http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). But feel free to use whichever you prefer.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [datastores.sh script](#datastoressh-script) installs MySQL Workbench.  If you prefer to install it separately, run:\n\n    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask\n    $ brew cask install --appdir="/Applications" mysqlworkbench\n\nYou can also find the MySQL Workbench download [here](http://www.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/). (**Note**: It will ask you to sign in, you don\'t need to, just click on "No thanks, just start my download!" at the bottom.)\n\n### MongoDB\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/mongodb.jpeg">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\n[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) is a popular [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [datastores.sh script](#datastoressh-script) installs MongoDB. If you prefer to install it separately, run:\n\n    $ brew update\n    $ brew install mongo\n\n#### Usage\n\nIn a terminal, start the MongoDB server:\n\n    $ mongod\n\nIn another terminal, connect to the database with the Mongo shell using:\n\n    $ mongo\n\nI\'ll let you refer to MongoDB\'s [Getting Started](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/getting-started/) guide for more!\n\n### Redis\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/redis.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\n[Redis](http://redis.io/) is a blazing fast, in-memory, key-value store, that uses the disk for persistence. It\'s kind of like a NoSQL database, but there are a lot of [cool things](http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/take-advantage-of-redis-adding-it-to-your-stack.html) that you can do with it that would be hard or inefficient with other database solutions. For example, it\'s often used as session management or caching by web apps, but it has many other uses.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [datastores.sh script](#datastoressh-script) installs Redis. If you prefer to install it separately, run:\n\n    $ brew update\n    $ brew install redis\n\n#### Usage\n\nStart a local Redis server using the default configuration settings with:\n\n    $ redis-server\n\nFor advanced usage, you can tweak the configuration file at `/usr/local/etc/redis.conf` (I suggest making a backup first), and use those settings with:\n\n    $ redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf\n\nIn another terminal, connect to the server with the Redis command-line interface using:\n\n    $ redis-cli\n\nI\'ll let you refer to Redis\' [documentation](http://redis.io/documentation) or other tutorials for more information.\n\n### Elasticsearch\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/elasticsearch.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nAs it says on the box, [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) is a "powerful open source, distributed real-time search and analytics engine". It uses an HTTP REST API, making it really easy to work with from any programming language.\n\nYou can use elasticsearch for such cool things as real-time search results, autocomplete, recommendations, machine learning, and more.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [datastores.sh script](#datastoressh-script) installs Elasticsearch.  If you prefer to install it separately, check out the following discussion.\n\nElasticsearch runs on Java, so check if you have it installed by running:\n\n    $ java -version\n\nIf Java isn\'t installed yet, a window will appear prompting you to install it. Go ahead and click "Install".\n\nNext, install elasticsearch with:\n\n    $ brew install elasticsearch\n\n**Note**: Elasticsearch also has a `plugin` program that gets moved to your `PATH`. I find that too generic of a name, so I rename it to `elasticsearch-plugin` by running (will need to do that again if you update elasticsearch):\n\n    $ mv /usr/local/bin/plugin /usr/local/bin/elasticsearch-plugin\n\nBelow I will use `elasticsearch-plugin`, just replace it with `plugin` if you haven\'t followed this step.\n\nAs you guessed, you can add plugins to elasticsearch. A popular one is [elasticsearch-head](http://mobz.github.io/elasticsearch-head/), which gives you a web interface to the REST API. Install it with:\n\n    $ elasticsearch-plugin --install mobz/elasticsearch-head\n\n### Usage\n\nStart a local elasticsearch server with:\n\n    $ elasticsearch\n\nTest that the server is working correctly by running:\n\n    $ curl -XGET \'http://localhost:9200/\'\n\nIf you installed the elasticsearch-head plugin, you can visit its interface at `http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/`.\n\nElasticsearch\'s [documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/) is more of a reference. To get started, I suggest reading some of the blog posts linked on this [StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11593035/beginners-guide-to-elasticsearch/11767610#11767610).\n\n## Section 6: Web Development\n\n### Node.js\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/nodejs.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [web.sh script](#websh-script) installs [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).  You can also install it manually with Homebrew:\n\n    $ brew update\n    $ brew install node\n\nThe formula also installs the [npm](https://npmjs.org/) package manager. However, as suggested by the Homebrew output, we need to add `/usr/local/share/npm/bin` to our path so that npm-installed modules with executables will have them picked up.\n\nTo do so, add this line to your `~/.path` file, before the `export PATH` line:\n\n```bash\nPATH=/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH\n```\n\nOpen a new terminal for the `$PATH` changes to take effect.\n\nWe also need to tell npm where to find the Xcode Command Line Tools, by running:\n\n    $ sudo xcode-select -switch /usr/bin\n\n(If Xcode Command Line Tools were installed by Xcode, try instead:)\n\n    $ sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\n\nNode modules are installed locally in the `node_modules` folder of each project by default, but there are at least two that are worth installing globally. Those are [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/):\n\n    $ npm install -g coffee-script\n    $ npm install -g grunt-cli\n\n#### Npm usage\n\nTo install a package:\n\n    $ npm install <package> # Install locally\n    $ npm install -g <package> # Install globally\n\nTo install a package and save it in your project\'s `package.json` file:\n\n    $ npm install <package> --save\n\nTo see what\'s installed:\n\n    $ npm list # Local\n    $ npm list -g # Global\n\nTo find outdated packages (locally or globally):\n\n    $ npm outdated [-g]\n\nTo upgrade all or a particular package:\n\n    $ npm update [<package>]\n\nTo uninstall a package:\n\n    $ npm uninstall <package>\n\n### JSHint\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/jshint.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nJSHint is a JavaScript developer\'s best friend.\n\nIf the extra credit assignment to install Sublime Package Manager was completed, JSHint can be run as part of Sublime Text.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [web.sh script](#websh-script) installs JSHint.  You can also install it manually via via npm:\n\n    $ npm install -g jshint\n\nFollow additional instructions on the [JSHint Package Manager page](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/JSHint) or [build it manually](https://github.com/jshint/jshint).\n\n### LESS\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/less.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nCSS preprocessors are becoming quite popular, the most popular processors are [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com). Preprocessing is a lot like compiling code for CSS. It allows you to reuse CSS in many different ways. Let\'s start out with using LESS as a basic preprocessor, it\'s used by a lot of popular CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [web.sh script](#websh-script) installs LESS.  To install LESS manually you have to use NPM / Node, which you installed earlier using Homebrew. In the terminal use:\n\n    $ npm install -g less\n\nNote: the `-g` flag is optional but it prevents having to mess around with file paths. You can install without the flag, just know what you\'re doing.\n\nYou can check that it installed properly by using:\n\n    $ lessc --version\n\nThis should output some information about the compiler:\n\n    lessc 1.5.1 (LESS Compiler) [JavaScript]\n\nOkay, LESS is installed and running. Great!\n\n#### Usage\n\nThere\'s a lot of different ways to use LESS. Generally I use it to compile my stylesheet locally. You can do that by using this command in the terminal:\n\n    $ lessc template.less template.css\n\nThe two options are the "input" and "output" files for the compiler. The command looks in the current directory for the LESS stylesheet, compiles it, and outputs it to the second file in the same directory. You can add in paths to keep your project files organized:\n\n    $ lessc less/template.less css/template.css\n\nRead more about LESS on their page here: http://lesscss.org/\n\n## Section 7: Android Development\n\n***This section is under development.***\n\n### Java\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/java.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe [android.sh script](#androidsh-script) installs Java.\n\nIf you prefer to install it separately, you can download the JDK [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or run:\n\n    $ brew update\n    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask\n    $ brew cask install --appdir="~/Applications" java\n\n### Android SDK\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/androidsdk.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nThe [android.sh script](#androidsh-script) installs the Android SDK.\n\nIf you prefer to install it separately, you can download it [here](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).\n\n### Android Studio\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/androidstudio.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nThe [android.sh script](#androidsh-script) installs Android Studio.\n\nIf you prefer to install it separately, you can download it [here](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) or run:\n\n    $ brew update\n    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask\n    $ brew cask install --appdir="~/Applications" android-studio\n\n### IntelliJ IDEA\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/intellij.png">\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nThe [android.sh script](#androidsh-script) installs Java.\n\nIf you prefer to install it separately, you can download it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) or run:\n\n    $ brew update\n    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask\n    $ brew cask install --appdir="~/Applications" intellij-idea-ce\n\n## Section 8: Misc\n\n### Contributions\n\nBug reports, suggestions, and pull requests are [welcome](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/issues)!\n\n### Credits\n\nSee the [Credits Page](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/CREDITS.md).\n\n## Contact Info\n\nFeel free to contact me to discuss any issues, questions, or comments.\n\nMy contact info can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/donnemartin).\n\n### License\n\nThis repository contains a variety of content; some developed by Donne Martin, and some from third-parties.
