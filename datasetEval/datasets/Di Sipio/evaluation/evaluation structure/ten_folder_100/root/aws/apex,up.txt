Just deploy your app with `$ up` and you\'re done!\n\nUse the free OSS version, or subscribe to [Up Pro](#pro-features) for a small monthly fee for unlimited use within your company, there is no additional cost per team-member or application. Deploy dozens or even hundreds of applications for pennies thanks to AWS Lambda\'s cost effective nature.\n\n## About\n\nUp focuses on deploying "vanilla" HTTP servers so there\'s nothing new to learn, just develop with your favorite existing frameworks such as Express, Koa, Django, Golang net/http or others.\n\nUp currently supports Node.js, Golang, Python, Java, Crystal, Clojure and static sites out of the box. Up is platform-agnostic, supporting AWS Lambda and API Gateway as the first targets. You can think of Up as self-hosted Heroku style user experience for a fraction of the price, with the security, isolation, flexibility, and scalability of AWS.\n\nCheck out the [documentation](https://up.docs.apex.sh/) for more instructions and links, or try one of the [examples](https://github.com/apex/up-examples), or chat with us in [Slack](https://chat.apex.sh/).\n\n![](assets/screen2.png)\n\n## OSS Features\n\nFeatures of the free open-source edition.\n\n![Open source edition features](assets/features-community.png)\n\n## Pro Features\n\nUp Pro provides additional features for production-ready applications such as encrypted environment variables, error alerting, unlimited team members, unlimited applications, priority [email support](mailto:support@apex.sh), and global deployments for **$19.99/mo USD**.
