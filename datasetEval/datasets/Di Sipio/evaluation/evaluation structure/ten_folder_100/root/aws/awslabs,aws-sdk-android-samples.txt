You can install the SDK via Android Studio or as stand-alone tools. See [Installing the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html).\n* Android Studio IDE 3.2+ (the official IDE for Android) or Gradle if you prefer CLI.\n\n#### Android Studio\nThis is the recommended way to run samples.\n* Import sample project into Android Studio. In the welcome screen, click `Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)`. Navigate to the sample directory and select a sample project to import.\n* Update source code with your AWS resources. Please read the README of each sample for more details.\n* Run it!\n\n#### Gradle\n* Make sure `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set to point to your Android SDK. See [Getting Started with Gradle](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Getting-Started-with-Gradle).\n* Update source code with your AWS resources. Please read the README of each sample for more details.\n* Connect an Android device to your computer or start an Android emulator. The minimum required API version for most samples is API level 10.\n* Compile the sample and install it. Run `gradlew installDebug`. Or if you on a Windows computer, use `gradlew.bat` instead. \n\n### FAQs<a name="faqs"></a>\n##### The sample can no longer be compiled/imported if I move it to another directory\n* We typically include the dependencies in the repo and have them already\nlinked, so if you move the project you\'ll need to also update the path to the\ndependency. To do this, modify the project.properties file of the project\n\n##### How do I use a different version of an included library(such as the Facebook SDK)?\n* Change the path to the library in project.properties of the project you are\nbuilding to be the path to the version you want\n\n##### I\'m getting an error saying that there are multiple versions of a jar\n* To fix this, make sure that all the jars you are using conform to the same\nversion. You can do this by just replacing all the problematic jars with the\nversion you would like to use.\n\n##### Where do I find login-with-amazon-sdk.jar?\n* The jar is usually already included where required. However, if not or if you want to use a different version, you can find it <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/engage/login-with-amazon/docs/install_sdk_android.html">here</a>.\n\n### Getting Help\n\nWe use [AWS Android SDK GitHub issues](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues) for tracking questions, bugs, and feature requests.\n'
