Using the CDK\xe2\x80\x99s library of\ninfrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate AWS best practices in your\ninfrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.\n\nThe CDK is available in the following languages:\n\n* JavaScript, TypeScript ([Node.js \xe2\x89\xa5 10.3.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/))\n* Python ([Python \xe2\x89\xa5 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/))\n* Java ([Java \xe2\x89\xa5 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Maven \xe2\x89\xa5 3.5.4](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))\n* .NET ([.NET Core \xe2\x89\xa5 3.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))\n\n-------\n\n[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide) |\n[CDK Workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/) |\n[Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) |\n[API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html) |\n[Examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples) |\n[Getting Help](#getting-help)\n\nDevelopers use the [CDK framework] in one of the\nsupported programming languages to define reusable cloud components called [constructs], which\nare composed together into [stacks], forming a "CDK app".\n\nThey then use the [AWS CDK CLI] to interact with their CDK app. The CLI allows developers to\nsynthesize artifacts such as AWS CloudFormation Templates, deploy stacks to development AWS accounts and "diff"\nagainst a deployed stack to understand the impact of a code change.\n\nThe [AWS Construct Library] includes a module for each\nAWS service with constructs that offer rich APIs that encapsulate the details of\nhow to use AWS. The AWS Construct Library aims to reduce the complexity and\nglue-logic required when integrating various AWS services to achieve your goals\non AWS.\n\n[cdk framework]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/\n[constructs]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html\n[stacks]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/apps_and_stacks.html#stacks\n[apps]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/apps_and_stacks.html#apps\n[Developer Guide]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide\n[AWS CDK CLI]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tools.html\n[AWS Construct Library]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/aws_construct_lib.html\n\n## At a glance\n\nInstall or update the [AWS CDK CLI] from npm (requires [Node.js \xe2\x89\xa5 10.3.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/)):\n\n```bash\n$ npm i -g aws-cdk\n```\n\n(See [Manual Installation](./MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md) for installing the CDK from a signed .zip file).\n\nInitialize a project:\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir hello-cdk\n$ cd hello-cdk\n$ cdk init sample-app --language=typescript\n```\n\nThis creates a sample project looking like this:\n\n```ts\nexport class HelloCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {\n  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {\n    super(scope, id, props);\n\n    const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, \'HelloCdkQueue\', {\n      visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(300)\n    });\n\n    const topic = new sns.Topic(this, \'HelloCdkTopic\');\n\n    topic.addSubscription(new subs.SqsSubscription(queue));\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDeploy this to your account:\n\n```bash\n$ cdk deploy\n```\n\nUse the `cdk` command-line toolkit to interact with your project:\n\n * `cdk deploy`: deploys your app into an AWS account\n * `cdk synth`: synthesizes an AWS CloudFormation template for your app\n * `cdk diff`: compares your app with the deployed stack\n\nFor a detailed walkthrough, see the [tutorial] in the AWS CDK [Developer Guide].\n\n## Getting Help\n\nPlease use these community resources for getting help. We use the GitHub issues\nfor tracking bugs and feature requests.\n\n* Ask a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-cdk)\n  and tag it with `aws-cdk`\n* Come join the AWS CDK community on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/awslabs/aws-cdk)\n* Open a support ticket with [AWS Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/)\n* If it turns out that you may have found a bug,\n  please open an [issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/new)\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome community contributions and pull requests.
