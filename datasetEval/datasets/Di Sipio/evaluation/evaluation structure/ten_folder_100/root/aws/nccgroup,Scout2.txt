The latest (and final) version of Scout2 can be found\nin https://github.com/nccgroup/Scout2/releases and https://pypi.org/project/AWSScout2.**\n\n**The project has migrated to https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite.**\n\n***********\nDescription\n***********\n\nScout2 is a security tool that lets AWS administrators assess their\nenvironment\'s security posture. Using the AWS API, Scout2 gathers configuration\ndata for manual inspection and highlights high-risk areas automatically. Rather\nthan pouring through dozens of pages on the web, Scout2 supplies a clear view of\nthe attack surface automatically.\n\n**Note:** Scout2 is stable and actively maintained, but a number of features and\ninternals may change. As such, please bear with us as we find time to work on,\nand improve, the tool. Feel free to report a bug with details (*e.g.* console\noutput using the "--debug" argument), request a new feature, or send a pull\nrequest.\n\n************\nInstallation\n************\n\nInstall via `pip`_:\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install awsscout2\n\nInstall from source:\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/nccgroup/Scout2\n    $ cd Scout2\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n    $ python setup.py install\n\n************\nRequirements\n************\n\nComputing resources\n-------------------\n\nScout2 is a multi-threaded tool that fetches and stores your AWS account\'s configuration settings in memory during\nruntime. It is expected that the tool will run with no issues on any modern laptop or equivalent VM.\n**Running Scout2 in a VM with limited computing resources such as a t2.micro instance is not intended and will likely\nresult in the process being killed.**\n\nPython\n------\n\nScout2 is written in Python and supports the following versions:\n\n* 2.7\n* 3.3\n* 3.4\n* 3.5\n* 3.6\n\nAWS Credentials\n---------------\n\nTo run Scout2, you will need valid AWS credentials (*e.g* Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).\nThe role, or user account, associated with these credentials requires read-only access for all resources in a number of\nservices, including but not limited to CloudTrail, EC2, IAM, RDS, Redshift, and S3.\n\nThe following AWS Managed Policies can be attached to the principal in order to grant necessary permissions:\n\n* ReadOnlyAccess\n* SecurityAudit\n\nCompliance with AWS\' Acceptable Use Policy\n------------------------------------------\n\nUse of Scout2 does not require AWS users to complete and submit the AWS\nVulnerability / Penetration Testing Request Form. Scout2 only performs AWS API\ncalls to fetch configuration data and identify security gaps, which is not\nconsidered security scanning as it does not impact AWS\' network and\napplications.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nAfter performing a number of AWS API calls, Scout2 will create a local HTML report and open it in the default browser.\n\nUsing a computer already configured to use the AWS CLI, boto3, or another AWS SDK, you may use Scout2 using the\nfollowing command:\n\n::\n\n    $ Scout2\n\n**Note:** EC2 instances with an IAM role fit in this category.\n\nIf multiple profiles are configured in your .aws/credentials and .aws/config files, you may specify which credentials\nto use with the following command:\n\n::\n\n    $ Scout2 --profile <PROFILE_NAME>\n\nIf you have a CSV file containing the API access key ID and secret, you may run Scout2 with the following command:\n\n::\n\n    $ Scout2 --csv-credentials <CREDENTIALS.CSV>\n\n**********************\nAdvanced documentation\n**********************\n\nThe following command will provide the list of available command line options:\n\n::\n\n    $ Scout2 --help\n\nFor further details, checkout our Wiki pages at https://github.com/nccgroup/Scout2/wiki.\n\n*******\nLicense\n*******\n\nGPLv2: See LICENSE.\n\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/index.html\n'
