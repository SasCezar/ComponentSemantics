Ain\'t nobody got time for dat.\n\nResults are saved so the first person might wait a bit to view package size, but everyone else gets to see the results instantly!\n\n## [Demo](https://packagephobia.now.sh)\n\nA good use case might be comparing test runners, web frameworks, or even bundlers.

cli that reports size after rollup bundles the package via npm team.\n- [Import Cost](https://github.com/wix/import-cost) extension (and cli) that displays package size inline in the editor.\n- [npm Download Size](https://github.com/arve0/npm-download-size) web app that reports the download size (network traffic) of a package.\n- [npm Download Size cli](https://github.com/arve0/npm-download-size-cli) cli that reports the download size (network traffic) of a package.\n- [Build Size](https://github.com/Daniel15/BuildSize) - GitHub App that comments on a PR with the size of your build artifacts\n- [Pkg Size](http://pkgsize.com) - web app that displays package size and file count over time (static data only)\n\n## Why is the size different than size on disk?\n\nDid you install a package and compare the size on disk with the size reported on Package Phobia?\n\nThis number will likely be different because Package Phobia doesn\'t know anything about your hard drive so it can\'t predict how blocks are allocated.\n\nPackages are known to contain many small `.js` files which can actually use up a lot of disk space, more than if there was one large, contiguous file.\n\nSee [this question](https://superuser.com/q/66825/27229) for more details.\n\n## What are the long term goals?\n\nIdeally, this information could be listed on npmjs.com, npms.io, or bundlephobia.com.\n\nBelow are the relevant feature requests for each website.\n\n- [GitHub issue for bundlephobia.com](https://github.com/pastelsky/bundlephobia/issues/40)\n- [GitHub issue for npmjs.com](https://github.com/npm/www/issues/197)\n- [GitHub issue for npms.io](https://github.com/npms-io/npms-www/issues/219)\n- [GitHub issue for staticgen.com](https://github.com/netlify/staticgen/issues/359)\n- [GitHub issue for cost-of-modules](https://github.com/siddharthkp/cost-of-modules/issues/50)\n- [GitHub issue for npm-cli](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/20427)\n- [GitHub issue for bundlesize](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize/issues/205)\n- [GitHub issue for npmgraph.an](https://github.com/anvaka/npmgraph.an/issues/25)\n\nHopefully, this would lead to publishers taking notice of their bloated packages such as the following:\n\n- [micro is not micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro/issues/234)\n- [ava is not minimal](https://github.com/avajs/ava/issues/1622)\n- [typescript has doubled in size since v2.0.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/23339)\n- [bundlesize is 10x larger after npm install since v0.14.0](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize/issues/213)\n- [jquery@3.3.0 accidentally adds 300 dependencies](https://twitter.com/styfle/status/985955164573065217)\n- [socket.io is 6x smaller](https://twitter.com/styfle/status/986224072882380802)\n- [serve@7.0.0 is 3x smaller](https://twitter.com/styfle/status/1001901854417178624)\n- [webpack-cli@3.0.0 is 4x smaller](https://twitter.com/styfle/status/1006605750981021697)\n- [v8n@1.1.1 is 11x smaller](https://twitter.com/styfle/status/1022433043498364931)\n- [now@13.0.0-canary.6 is 2x smaller](https://twitter.com/styfle/status/1064512498706116617)\n\n## npm dependencies in the media\n\nI\'m not the first one to notice npm packages are snowballing into bloated dependencies of dependencies.\n\nBelow are some other users who comically point out this JS bloat.\n\n- [thomasfuchs](https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/977541462199029760)\n- [ben_a_adams](https://twitter.com/ben_a_adams/status/979358943561609216)\n- [devrant](https://devrant.com/rants/760537/heaviest-objects-in-the-universe)\n- [turnoff.us](https://turnoff.us/geek/npm-install/)\n- [styfle](https://twitter.com/styfle/status/968180698149539841)\n- [davej](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10361)\n- [FredyC](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2088)\n- [tomitrescak](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12515)\n- [maybekatz](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/988893800054456320)\n- [hichaelmart](https://twitter.com/hichaelmart/status/988882864270962688)\n- [brad_frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/996014341592961025)\n- [Bryan_Chapel](https://twitter.com/Bryan_Chapel/status/1002680482159648769)\n- [getabitlit](https://twitter.com/getabitlit/status/1013524294394003456)\n- [iamdevloper](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/1013767672369242112)\n- [rickhanlonii](https://twitter.com/rickhanlonii/status/1062319416107560961)\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/styfle/packagephobia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/styfle/packagephobia/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before you start writing any code\n\n## Sponsoring\n\nGet your name in this readme by [sponsoring this project](https://github.com/sponsors/styfle).\n\n## Author\n\nDeveloped by [ceriously.com](https://www.ceriously.com)\n'
