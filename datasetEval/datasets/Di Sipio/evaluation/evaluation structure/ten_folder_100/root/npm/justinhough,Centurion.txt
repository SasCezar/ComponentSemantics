b'# Centurion Framework[<img src="http://www.centurionframework.com/graphics/centurion_200_blue.png" alt="Centurion" width="200" align="right">][centurion]\n\n[![NPM version][npm-img]][npm-url]\n[![Gem version][ruby-img]][ruby-url]\n[![Gitter chat][gitter-img]][gitter-url]\n\nCenturion is a responsive framework built for speed, simplicity, and flexibility. Originally based loosely on the [960 grid built by Nathan Smith](http://960.gs/), Centurion boasted a responsive grid system that would help alleviate the headache of building responsive designs. Like all web projects it grew and started to capitalize on several different areas like: typography, buttons, tables, and more in order to create a seamless framework that could allow web developers to start up a new project easily without the need to override every little piece.\n\nIf you\'re concerned about browser support then we recommend either [html5shiv](https://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/) or [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) to your web site or project to help support CSS3 and HTML5.\n\n\n## @TODO for 2018\n- Rebuild grid to use Flexbox and CSS Grid - [Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [Complete Guide to CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)\n- Rework for responsive breakpoints\n- CSS classes re-analyzed to be more semantic\n- New color scheme and full greyscale for backgrounds, text, etc. - [Sass Color Variables That Don\xe2\x80\x99t Suck](https://davidwalsh.name/sass-color-variables-dont-suck)\n- Better documentation\n- Component and Pattern library for frequently used layouts\n- SCSS to Sass linter via [Hound](https://houndci.com/configuration#sass-lint)\n- Travis CI integration\n- Living style guide using [Nucleus](https://holidaypirates.github.io/nucleus/index.html)\n- Removal of Grunt in favor of a full Node build process (for less dependencies)\n\n## Install with NPM\n\n### Getting Started\n\nThis plugin requires Grunt `^0.4.5`\n\nIf you haven\'t used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you\'re familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n`npm install centurion-framework --save-dev`\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n`grunt.loadNpmTasks(\'centurion-framework\');`\n\n#### Grunt Usage\n\nWhen using Centurion with Grunt you can use one of two modules: `grunt-contrib-sass` or `grunt-sass`. We recommend the later since it\'s built on [libsass](http://libsass.org/) and compiles much faster, but it is [missing some features](http://sass-compatibility.github.io/) so the decision is yours.\n\nFor [grunt-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass) you can add Centurion to your project using `includePaths` (as in the example below) or with [grunt-contrib-sass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass) you can change it to `loadPath` for the same result. Here is an example:\n\n```\n\'sass\': {\n  target: {\n    options: {\n      precision: 4, // makes all decimals round to 4 places\n      sourcemap: \'auto\', // adds a sourcemap to compiled CSS for inspecting\n      includePaths: [\'node_modules/centurion-framework/lib/sass/\']\n    },\n    files: {\n      \'path/to.css\': \'path/to.scss\'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Gulp Usage\n\nYou can also use Centurion with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). By using the module [`gulp-sass`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass/) add the library module to your `includePaths` found in the example Gulp task below.\n\n```\ngulp.task(\'sass\', function() {\n  return gulp.src( \'source/sass/*.scss\')\n    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())\n    .pipe(sass({\n    \tincludePaths: \'./node_modules/centurion-framework/lib/sass\',\n    \terrLogToConsole: true\n    }))\n    .pipe(sourcemaps.write(\'./\'))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest( \'build/css\' ));\n});\n```\n\nIf you\'re interested in using Gulp check out a [simple starter project](https://github.com/justinhough/gulp-project-setup) on Github that shows you how to start using Centurion in your next web project.\n\n\n\n## Install as a RubyGem\n\n### Getting Started\n\nInstall the gem: `gem install centurion-framework`\n\nIf you have an existing project: `require \'centurion-framework\'`\n\n### Configuration\n\nYou also have the option of importing Centurion components as needed into your project. Start by including the entire library at the top of your Sass file:\n\n`@import "centurion-framework";`\n\nThen you can include any of the modules from Centurion that you need. For example if you wanted to only include normalize, the Centurion grid, and typography then you would add the following:\n\n```\n@include normalize();\n@include flex-grid();\n@include typography();\n```\n\n\n## Documentation and Examples\n\nRead our [docs](DOCUMENTATION.md) or view examples on our [Github page](http://justinhough.github.io/Centurion/resources.html). We are always trying to improve our documentation and examples, so please submit an issue labeled `docs` with the description of what needs to be updated.\n\n## Versioning\n\nCenturion no longer supports Internet Explorer 7 as of version `3.5.3`.\n\nReview [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for updates and changes to the framework.\n\n## Bugs and feature requests\n\nIf you find a bug or have a feature request you would like added to Centurion. Please search for [existing](https://github.com/justinhough/Centurion/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) and [closed](https://github.com/justinhough/Centurion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to see any similar issues.
