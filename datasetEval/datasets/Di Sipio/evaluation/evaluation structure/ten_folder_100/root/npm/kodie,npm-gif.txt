Otherwise an [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) version of the images will be displayed.*\n\n## Installation\n```shell\nnpm install --global npm-gif\n```\n\n### Bonus Points\nAdd this line to your `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.zshrc` file so that you can experience awesomeness with the `npm install` command:\n\n```shell\nalias npm=npm-gif\n```\n\n## Configure\nYou can change the loading GIF by setting the `NPM_GIF` environment variable to a file path or URL.\n\n## How?\nWhen npm-gif is first run, it checks to see if it was passed the `install` or `i` arguments indicating that the user wishes to install an npm package. If neither of those arguments were passed, it simply spawns a new process of npm, passing the supplied arguments and options to it. If we are dealing with an install, it pretends that we have already required the [gauge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gauge) package but really, using [mock-require](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-require), we have required [gauge-gif.js](gauge-gif.js) which is just [progress-img](https://www.npmjs.com/package/progress-img) pretending to be gauge. We then require your local version of npm using [global-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/global-npm) (which won't reload gauge) and then use its internal functions to run the install command, passing arguments and options to it.\n\n## Why?\nWhen I first saw [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)'s [term-img](https://www.npmjs.com/package/term-img) package I was inspired to create [giph](https://github.com/kodie/giph) and then [progress-img](https://github.com/kodie/progress-img). I then saw [@vadimdemedes](https://github.com/vadimdemedes)'s [gifi](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/gifi) package and wondered if there was a way I could implement progress-img into npm.\n\nIn short, this was basically just an experiment for fun. :)\n\n## License\nMIT.
