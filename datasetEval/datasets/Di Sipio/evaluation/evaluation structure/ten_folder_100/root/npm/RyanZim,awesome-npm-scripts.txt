If a command fails, the script exits.\n- Use `|` to pipe the stdout of one command into the stdin of the next. (`do-something | something else`)\n- Use `>` to write the stdout of a command to a file. (`do-something > file`)\n- Use `<` to send the contents of a file to a command\'s stdin. (`command < file`)\n- Use `cd <dir>` to change the current working directory to `<dir>`. Note that `cd` alone prints the current working directory on windows, but changes the working directory to `~` on \\*nix.\n\n## `npm run` Reference\n\nYou can use `npm run-script` or `npm run`; they both do the same thing, but `npm run` is shorter.\n\n- Run just `npm run` to print a list of scripts.\n- Running `npm run script` (where `script` is the name of your script) will run `prescript`, `script`, and `postscript`; in that order.\n  - You can\'t nest `pre` and `post` hooks (i.e. `preprescript` won\'t work).\n- You can pass arguments to your scripts by passing `--` to `npm run`, followed by the arguments. Example: Given the script `"mocha": "mocha"`, you can run `npm run mocha -- --reporter xunit`. This effectively runs `mocha --reporter xunit`.\n- Running `npm test` is the same as running `npm run test`. The same applies to `npm start` and `npm stop`.\n- You can run `npm run <script> -s` to silence the default npm output (useful for calling a script within another script).\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/RyanZim/awesome-npm-scripts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## License\n\n[![CC0](http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/buttons/88x31/svg/cc-zero.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n'
