You can run Salus on a repository via the Docker daemon and it will determine which scanners are relevant, run them and provide the output. Most scanners are other mature open source projects which we include directly in the container.\n\n```sh\n# Navigate to the root directory of the project you want to run Salus on\ncd /path/to/repo\n\n# Run the following line while in the root directory (No edits necessary)\ndocker run --rm -t -v $(pwd):/home/repo coinbase/salus\n```\n\nSalus is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines because it becomes a centralized place to coordinate scanning across a large fleet of repositories. Typically, scanners are configured at the repository level for each project. This means that when making org wide changes to how the scanners are run, each repository must be updated. Instead, you can update Salus and all builds will instantly inherit the change.\n\nSalus supports powerful configuration that allows for global defaults and local tweaks. Finally, Salus can report metrics on each repository, such as what packages are included or what concerns exist. These reports can be centrally evaluated in your infrastructure to allow for scalable security tracking.\n\n## Using Salus in your Repo\n\nFor your given CI, update the config file to run salus. In circle, it will look like this: \n\n```sh\ndocker run --rm -t -v $(pwd):/home/repo coinbase/salus\n```\n\ncoinbase/salus pulls the docker image\n\n## Supported Scanners\n\n- [BundleAudit](docs/scanners/bundle_audit.md) - Execution of [bundle-audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit), looks for CVEs in ruby gem dependencies.\n- [Brakeman](docs/scanners/brakeman.md) - Execution of [Brakeman](https://brakemanscanner.org/), looks for vulnerable code in Rails projects.\n- [npm audit](docs/scanners/npm_audit.md) - Execution of [`npm audit`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/running-a-security-audit) which looks for CVEs in node module dependencies.\n- [yarn audit](docs/scanners/yarn_audit.md) - Execution of [`yarn audit`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/audit/) which looks for CVEs in node module dependencies.\n- [PatternSearch](docs/scanners/pattern_search.md) - Looks for certain strings in a project that might be dangerous or could require that certain strings be present.\n\nSalus also parses dependency files and reports on what libraries and version are being used in any given project. This can be useful for tracking dependencies across your fleet.The currently supported languages are:\n- Ruby\n- Node\n- Python\n- Go\n\nSometimes it\'s necessary to whitelist certain CVEs that Salus detects. The [docs/scanners directory](docs/scanners) explains how to do so for each scanner that Salus supports.\n\nIf you would like to build custom scanners or support more languages that are not currently supported, you can use [this method of building custom Salus images](docs/custom_salus.md).\n\n\n## CircleCI Integration\n\nSalus can be integrated with CircleCI by using a public orb. All Salus configuration options are supported, and defaults are the same as for Salus itself. \n\nExample CircleCI `config.yml`:\n\n```\nversion: 2.1\n\norbs:\n  salus: federacy/salus@3.0.0\n\nworkflows:\n  main:\n    jobs:\n      - salus/scan\n```\n\n## Using Salus in your Repo\n\nFor your given CI, update the config file to run salus. In circle, it will look like this: \n\n```sh\ndocker run --rm -t -v $(pwd):/home/repo coinbase/salus\n```\n\ncoinbase/salus pulls the docker image\n\n\n## [Detailed Documentation](docs)\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x91\xb7\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x82\xef\xb8\x8f Development\n\nContribution to this project is extremely welcome and it\'s our sincere hope that the work we\'ve done to this point only serves as a foundation for allowing the security/development communities as a whole to come together to improve the security of **everyone\'s** infrastructure.\n\nYou can read more about [getting your development environment set up](docs/development.md), or [the architecture of Salus](docs/architecture.md).\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x93\x83 License\n\nThis project is available open source under the terms of the [Apache 2.0 License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0).\n'
