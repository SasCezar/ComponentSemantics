b'# Simple State Manager 4\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathan-fielding/SimpleStateManager.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathan-fielding/SimpleStateManager) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/jonathan-fielding/SimpleStateManager.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jonathan-fielding/SimpleStateManager)\n\nSimple State Manager (SSM for short) is a javascript state manager for responsive websites. It is built to be light weight, has no dependencies (except javascript of course) and aims to be really easy to simply drop into your project ready to use.\n\nAs a state manager, SSM allows you to target different javascript towards different states of your site. It allows you to define as many states as your site requires and allows you to have independent Enter, Leave and Resize events for each of the states.\n\n##Getting started\n\nTo get started with SSM the first step is to include it in your project, you can do this in two ways\n\n* Download and add the ssm.js (or ssm.min.js) file to your site\n* Use Bower to add to your project using bower install SimpleStateManager\n\n##Documentation\nDocumentation can be found at http://www.simplestatemanager.com\n\n##Browser Support\nVersion 4.x of SimpleStateManager is built in ES6 so for the majority of browsers will require being transpiled to work accross different browsers. In its transpiled form SimpleStateManager supports:\n\n* Internet Explorer 10+ (Internet Explorer 9 should work if you use a matchMedia polyfill)\n* Google Chrome\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Opera\n* Apple Safari\n\nThe library is tested across browser prior to each release and every commit is validated using TravisCI and BrowserStack.\n\nIf you need to support Internet Explorer 8 or below their are two options available:\n\n* Use a matchMedia polyfill and a bind polfill\n* Use SimpleStateManager 2.X.X branch\n\n##Release Log\n\n### 4.0.0 - 10th December 2017</h2>\nIn SimpleStateManager 4 the library is completely rewritten into ES6.
