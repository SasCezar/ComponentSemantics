The entire `ungrid.css` file is 97 bytes minified.\n\n```css\n@media (min-width: 30em) {\n    .row { width: 100%; display: table; table-layout: fixed; }\n    .col { display: table-cell; }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Get started\n\n- Install with [npm](//www.npmjs.com/package/ungrid) `npm install ungrid`\n- Install with [Bower](//bower.io) `bower install ungrid`\n- Or just copy and paste the contents of ungrid.min.css into your CSS file.\n\n\n\n## How to use\n\nTo use, simply put as many `.col`s as you wish in your `.row`s and the `.col`s will automatically be evenly spaced. This allows you to roll your own simple grids.
