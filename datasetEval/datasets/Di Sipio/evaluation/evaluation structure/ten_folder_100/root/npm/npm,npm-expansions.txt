b'# npm-expansions\n[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/npm-expansions.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/npm-expansions) [![NPM license](http://img.shields.io/npm/l/npm-expansions.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/npm-expansions)\n\nWhat does n-p-m stand for?\n\n## What This Is\n\nThis is the source code for the three-word thingies that randomly appear in the header of the [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) website. Examples include:\n\n- Naughty Push Message\n- Nectar of the Programming Masses\n- Needless Patchouli Manufacture\n- Neil Patrick\'s Mansion\n- Never Program Mad\n- Never Push to Master\n- Neverending Plethora of Modules\n- Newton\'s Programmatic Measurements\n- Newts Parading Majestically\n- Nice Poodle, Mister\n- Nickel Plated Moose\n- Nineties Party Mix\n- Null Pointer Missing\n\n## How to Contribute\n\n1. Add your own expansion to [expansions.txt](expansions.txt)\n2. Run `npm test` (this will format and alphabetize the file)\n3. Send us a pull request!\n\n**If you think of multiple possibilities, please submit them as separate PRs**, as we may like some but not others.\n\nSome other suggestions:\n\n* Be meaningful. Three random words is not good enough.\n* Be funny. This is very subjective, we realize, so try not to take it personally if we don\'t get it.\n* Be novel. If your expansion starts with "Node" the other two words better be pretty great.\n* Avoid hyphenation, especially "non-". Yes, there are some in there already. Sorry.\n* Use actual words. You can\'t just make up random new words. Unless they\'re really good.\n* Avoid names of people and products (other than npm ;-))\n* Avoid expansions that are gendered, sexual, religious, aggressive, or violent. We are a diverse, positive place.\n* Avoid anything that even slightly hints of violating npm\'s [code of conduct](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct/). These are literally the first words that appear on the website, and our audience is very broad, so it\'s best to avoid things that can be misconstrued.\n* Avoid using proper country and/or corporate names\n\n## No More Please\n\nWe\'ll no longer be accepting expansions that begin with the following frequent suggestions:\n* National\n* Nautical\n* Naughty\n* Nerd(s)\n* Never\n* New\n* Newly\n* Nice\n* Nicely\n* Nifty\n* Ninja(s)\n* No\n* Non\n* Nobody\n* Nobody\'s\n* Node\n* Not\n* Now\n\n## Conflicts\n\nIf your Pull Request has conflicts it will be closed automatically. We apologize beforehand for anyone that might have to reopen their contribution after rebasing and/or fixing the issue on their branch. We\'re looking to [modernize/automate](https://github.com/npm/npm-expansions/tree/feature/automation-refactor) much of the checking/verfication of submissions going forward.\n'
