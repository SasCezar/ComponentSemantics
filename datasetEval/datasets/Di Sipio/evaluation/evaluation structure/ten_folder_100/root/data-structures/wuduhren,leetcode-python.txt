b'# Overview\n1. This is my Python (2.7) Leetcode solution.\nAs time grows, this also become a guide to prepare for software engineer interview.\n\n2. I really take time tried to make the best solution and collect the best resource that I found.  \nBecause I wanted to help others like me. \nIf you like my answer, a star on GitHub means a lot to me. \nhttps://github.com/wuduhren/leetcode-python  \n\n3. The solution is at `problems/the-file-name/`.\nFor example, `merge-sorted-array.py`\'s solution is at `https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/`.\n\n\n# Leetcode Similar Problems\nI found it makes sense to solve similar problems together, so that we can recognize the problem faster when we encounter a new one. My suggestion is to skip the HARD problems when you first go through these list.\n\n### Two Pointers\n|  Id | Name | Difficulty | Comments |\n| ---: | --- | :---: | --- |\n|  11 | [Container With Most

Having a right mindset is the most important one. It keeps you going when you are tired after work. Studying when everyone else are out having fun. Reminding you that your goals are not going to come easy, it takes time, self-discipline, mental and physical toughness...\n\n2. [How to Get a Job at the Big 4](https://youtu.be/YJZCUhxNCv8).\n\n3.

TCP are in order.\n    * They both have error messages, but TCP will resent it again, UDP does not.\n    * TCP needs a three-way handshake to initiate a connection between ports.

Because we has to use "pointers" to access.\n        * We are responsible to free() the memory.\n        * Heap variable is global variable in nature.\n9. GET vs POST\n10.
