b'# Data Structures for PHP 7\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/php-ds/ext-ds.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/php-ds/ext-ds)\n[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9w0xitp3q04hdu1d?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rtheunissen/ext-ds)\n[![PECL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PECL-1.2.9-blue.svg)](https://pecl.php.net/package/ds)\n\nAn extension providing specialized data structures as efficient alternatives to the PHP array.\nYou can read about it in more detail [in this blog post](https://medium.com/p/9dda7af674cd) which highlights the API, performance and other benefits of using the extension.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is available on [php.net](http://docs.php.net/manual/en/book.ds.php). You should also include the [polyfill](https://github.com/php-ds/polyfill) in your project for IDE integration.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way to install the extension is to use PECL:\n\n```\npecl install ds\n```\n\nIf you\'re on Windows, you can download a compiled .dll on [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/package/ds) or under [releases](https://github.com/php-ds/extension/releases).\n\n## Enabling the extension\n\nYou\'ll need to add `extension=ds.so` to your primary *php.ini* file.\n\nIf you encounter an "undefined symbol" error, see [#2](https://github.com/php-ds/extension/issues/2#issuecomment-181855047).\n\n```bash\n# To see where .ini files are located\nphp -i | grep "\\.ini"\n```\n\n---\n\nYou can also enable the extension temporarily using the command line:\n\n```bash\nphp -d extension=ds.so\n```\n\n**Note**: Windows would use php_ds.dll instead.\n\n## Testing\n\nThere is a suite of PHPUnit tests that can be installed using [**Composer**](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).\n\n``` bash\ncomposer install   # Install the test suite\ncomposer test      # Run the tests\ncomposer memtest   # Run the tests checking for memory leaks\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nYou may include the [polyfill](https://github.com/php-ds/polyfill) as a dependency in your project. This allows your codebase to still function in an environment where the extension is not installed.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n\n## Credits\n\n- [Rudi Theunissen](https://github.com/rtheunissen)\n- [Joe Watkins](https://github.com/krakjoe)\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT).
