You can take up the [HacktoberFest Challenge Issue](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/issues/471) and send pull requests solving the Hackerrank's problems in any of their tracks/domains.\n2. You can create new issues. Before that, read the [Introduction to Contributing](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/wiki/Introduction-to-Contributing) wiki page.\n3. Make sure to read the [Coding Standards Wiki Page](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/wiki/Coding-Standards).\n\n### Algorithms\nThe algorithms list is available in this [wiki page](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/wiki/Algorithms). The folder [Algorithms](Algorithms/) contains all the implementations.\n\n### Data Structures\nThe data structures list is available in this [wiki page](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/wiki/Data-Structures). The folder [Data Structures](Data%20Structures) contains all the implementations.\n\n### Problem Solutions\nThe solutions to various problems in different contests or practice problems on the following sites are available in [Problem Solutions](Problem%20Solutions/) folder.\n\n### Template for Contests\nTemplates are available in [Templates](Templates/) folder.\n\n### How to contribute\n  1. #### Refer to [Introduction to Contributing](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/wiki/Introduction-to-Contributing) for contribution guidelines.\n\n  2. #### Refer to the [Coding Standards Wiki Page](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/wiki/Coding-Standards) for the coding standards to be followed.\n"
