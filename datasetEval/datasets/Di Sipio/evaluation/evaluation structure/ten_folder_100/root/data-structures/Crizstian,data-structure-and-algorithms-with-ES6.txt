Each node is linked to a successor node in the list using an object reference.\n| 6.- | [Double Linked List](./06-chapter-Linked-Lists-types)\xc2\xa0| 3 | Traversing a `Double linked list` are more efficient, since we no longer have to search for the previous node.\n| 7.- | [Circular Linked List](./06-chapter-Linked-Lists-types)\xc2\xa0| 4 | The reason you might want to create a `Circular linked list` is if you want the ability to go backward through a list but don\xe2\x80\x99t want the extra overhead of creating a doubly linked list.\n| 8.- | [Hashing](./08-chapter-Hashing.js) | 2 | `Hashing` is a common technique for storing data in such a way that the data can be inserted and retrieved very quickly. Hashing uses a data structure called a hash table. Although hash tables provide fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval, they perform poorly for operations that involve searching.\n| 9.- | [Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees](./10-chapter-Binary-Tree) | 4 | `Binary trees` are chosen over other more primary data structures because you can search a binary tree very quickly (as opposed to a linked list, for example) and you can quickly insert and delete data from a binary tree (as opposed to an array).\n| 10.- | [Graph Data Structure](./11-chapter-Graphs) | 2 | A graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges. A map is a type of graph where each town is a vertex, and a road that connects two towns is an edge. Edges are defined as a pair (v1, v2), where v1 and v2 are two vertices in a graph\n| 11.- | [Sorting Algorithms](./12-chapter-Sorting-Algorithms) | 6 | Two of the most common operations performed on data stored in a computer are sorting and searching.\n| 12.- | [Searching Algorithms](./13-chapter-Searching-Algorithms) | 6 | There are two ways to search for data in a list: sequential search and binary search. A sequential search is used when the items in a list are in random order; a binary search is used when the items in a list are in sorted order.\n\n\n### To run the examples we need the following:\n\n- NodeJS Installed\n- Open Any Terminal and position it to the folder where the files are located\n- execute the tests: `$ npm install` then `node_modules/.bin/qunit -t path/test.js -c path/tests.js`\n\n### References\n- [Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029557.do)\n- [7 algorithms and data structures every programmer must know](https://codingsec.net/2016/03/7-algorithms-data-structures-every-programmer/)\n\nSome exercises are based from the book [Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029557.do) - [by Michael McMillian (O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly)](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/518) ISBN - 978-1-449-36493-9.\n'
