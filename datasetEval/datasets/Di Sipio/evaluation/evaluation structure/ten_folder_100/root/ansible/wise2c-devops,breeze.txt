b'# Breeze\n- Deploy a Production Ready Kubernetes Cluster with graphical interface\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wise2c-devops/breeze.svg?branch=v1.16)](https://travis-ci.org/wise2c-devops/breeze)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/wise2c-devops/breeze/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n[English](./README.md) | [\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87](./README-CN.md)\n\n**Note**: Branches may be in an *unstable or even broken state* during development.\nPlease use [releases](https://github.com/wise2c-devops/breeze/releases) instead of those branches in order to get stable binaries.\n\nRefer to **[User Guide](manual/BreezeManual.pdf)** for more details on how to use Breeze.\n\n<img alt="Breeze" src="manual/BreezeLogo.png">\n\nProject Breeze is an open source trusted solution allow you to create Kubernetes clusters on your internal, secure, cloud network with graphical user interface. As a cloud native installer project, Breeze is listed in [CNCF Cloud Native Interactive Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/category=certified-kubernetes-installer&format=card-mode&selected=wise2-c-technology-breeze).\n\n<img alt="Breeze" src="manual/BreezeCNCF.png">\n\n## Features\n* **Easy to run**: Breeze combines all resources you need such as kubernetes components images, ansible playbooks for the deployment of kubernetes clusters into a single docker image (wise2c/playbook). It also works as a local RHEL/CentOS yum and Ubuntu apt repository server. You just need a linux server with docker and docker-compose installed to run Breeze.\n\n* **Simplified the process of kubernetes clusters deployment**: With a few simple commands, you can get Breeze running, and then finish all the other deployment processes by the graphical interface.\n\n* **Support offline deployment**: After 5 images (playbook, yum-repo/apt-source, pagoda, deploy-ui) have been loaded on the deploy server, kubernetes clusters can be setup without internet access. Breeze works as a yum/apt repository server and deploys a local Harbor registry and uses kubeadm to setup kubernetes clusters. All docker images will be pulled from the local Harbor registry. \n\n* **Support multi-cluster**: Breeze supports multiple kubernetes clusters deployment.\n\n* **Support high available architecture**:  With Breeze, you can setup kubernetes clusters with 3 master servers and 3 etcd servers combined with haproxy and keepalived. All worker nodes will use the virtual floating ip address to communicate with the master servers.\n\n## Architecture\n![Alt](./manual/Wise2C-Breeze-Architecture.png)\n\n## Components\n- **breeze**: Ansible playbook for deployments of docker, harbor, haproxy+keepalived, etcd, kubernetes.\n\n- **yum-repo**: RHEL/CentOS yum repository for docker, docker-compose, kubelet, kubectl, kubeadm, kubernetes-cni etc,. \n\n- **apt-source**: Ubuntu apt source repository for docker, docker-compose, kubelet, kubectl, kubeadm, kubernetes-cni etc,. \n\n- **deploy-ui**: Graphical user interface.\n\n- **pagoda**: Server offers the API to operate Ansible playbooks.\n\n- **kubeadm-version**: Get k8s components images version list by command "kubeadm config"\n\n## Install & Run\n\n**System requirements:**\n\n**Deploy server:** docker 1.13.1+ and docker-compose 1.12.0+ .\n\n**Kubernetes cluster server:** CentOS 7.4/7.5/7.6/7.7 or Ubuntu 16/18 is required and minimal installation mode is recommended. \n\nRefer to **[User Guide](manual/BreezeManual.pdf)** for more details on how to use Breeze.\n\n## Community\n\n* **Slack:** Join Breeze\'s community for discussion and ask questions: [Breeze Slack](https://wise2c-breeze.slack.com/), channel: #general\n\n## License\n\nBreeze is available under the [Apache 2 license](LICENSE).\n'
