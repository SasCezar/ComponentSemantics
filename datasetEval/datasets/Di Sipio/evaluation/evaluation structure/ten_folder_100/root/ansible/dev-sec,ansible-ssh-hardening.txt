b'# ssh-hardening (Ansible Role)\n\n[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/dev-sec/ansible-ssh-hardening.svg)][1]\n[![Gitter Chat](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)][2]\n[![Ansible Galaxy](https://img.shields.io/badge/galaxy-ssh--hardening-660198.svg)][3]\n\n## Description\n\nThis role provides secure ssh-client and ssh-server configurations.  It is intended to be compliant with the [DevSec SSH  Baseline](https://github.com/dev-sec/ssh-baseline).\n\nWarning: This role disables root-login on the target server! Please make sure you have another user with su or sudo permissions that can login into the server.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Ansible > 2.5\n\n## Role Variables\n| Name           | Default Value | Description                        |\n| -------------- | ------------- | -----------------------------------|\n|`network_ipv6_enable` | false |true if IPv6 is needed|\n|`ssh_server_ports` | [\'22\'] |ports on which ssh-server should listen|\n|`ssh_client_port` | \'22\' |port to which ssh-client should connect|\n|`ssh_listen_to` | [\'0.0.0.0\'] |one or more ip addresses, to which ssh-server should listen to.

These options will be set on the **beginning** of the file so you can override options further down in the file.\n\nExample playbook:\n\n```\n- hosts: localhost\n  roles:\n    - dev-sec.ssh-hardening\n  vars:\n    ssh_custom_options:\n      - "Include /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/*"\n    sshd_custom_options:\n      - "AcceptEnv LANG"\n```\n\n## Example Playbook\n\n    - hosts: localhost\n      roles:\n        - dev-sec.ssh-hardening\n\n## Local Testing\n\nThe preferred way of locally testing the role is to use Docker. You will have to install Docker on your system. See [Get started](https://docs.docker.com/) for a Docker package suitable to for your system.\n\nYou can also use vagrant and Virtualbox or VMWare to run tests locally. You will have to install Virtualbox and Vagrant on your system. See [Vagrant Downloads](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) for a vagrant package suitable for your system. For all our tests we use `test-kitchen`. If you are not familiar with `test-kitchen` please have a look at [their guide](http://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started).\n\nNext install test-kitchen:\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\ngem install bundler\nbundle install\n```\n\n### Testing with Docker\n```\n# fast test on one machine\nbundle exec kitchen test ssh-ubuntu1804-ansible-latest\n\n# test on all machines\nbundle exec kitchen test\n\n# for development\nbundle exec kitchen create ssh-ubuntu1804-ansible-latest\nbundle exec kitchen converge ssh-ubuntu1804-ansible-latest\nbundle exec kitchen verify ssh-ubuntu1804-ansible-latest\n\n# cleanup\nbundle exec kitchen destroy ssh-ubuntu1804-ansible-latest\n```\n\n### Testing with Virtualbox\n```\n# fast test on one machine\nKITCHEN_YAML=".kitchen.vagrant.yml" bundle exec kitchen test ssh-ubuntu-1804\n\n# test on all machines\nKITCHEN_YAML=".kitchen.vagrant.yml" bundle exec kitchen test\n\n# for development\nKITCHEN_YAML=".kitchen.vagrant.yml" bundle exec kitchen create ssh-ubuntu-1804\nKITCHEN_YAML=".kitchen.vagrant.yml" bundle exec kitchen converge ssh-ubuntu-1804\n```\nFor more information see [test-kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started)\n\n## FAQ / Pitfalls\n\n**I can\'t log into my account. I have registered the client key, but it still doesn\'t let me it.**\n\nIf you have exhausted all typical issues (firewall, network, key missing, wrong key, account disabled etc.), it may be that your account is locked. The quickest way to find out is to look at the password hash for your user:\n\n    sudo grep myuser /etc/shadow\n\nIf the hash includes an `!`, your account is locked:\n\n    myuser:!:16280:7:60:7:::\n\nThe proper way to solve this is to unlock the account (`passwd -u myuser`). If the user doesn\'t have a password, you should can unlock it via:\n\n    usermod -p "*" myuser\n\nAlternatively, if you intend to use PAM, you enabled it via `ssh_use_pam: true`. PAM will allow locked users to get in with keys.\n\n\n**Why doesn\'t my application connect via SSH anymore?**\n\nAlways look into log files first and if possible look at the negotation between client and server that is completed when connecting.\n\nWe have seen some issues in applications (based on python and ruby) that are due to their use of an outdated crypto set. This collides with this hardening module, which reduced the list of ciphers, message authentication codes (MACs) and key exchange (KEX) algorithms to a more secure selection.\n\n**After using the role Ansibles template/copy/file module does not work anymore!**\n\nThis role by default deactivates SFTP. Ansible uses by default SFTP to transfer files to the remote hosts. You have to set `scp_if_ssh = True` in your ansible.cfg. This way Ansible uses SCP to copy files. Alternatively you can enable SFTP again by setting `sftp_enabled` to `true`.\n\n**Cannot restart sshd-service due to lack of privileges**\n\nIf you get the following error when running handler "restart sshd"\n```\nUnable to restart service ssh: Failed to restart ssh.service: Access denied\n```\nor\n```\nfailure 1 running systemctl show for \'ssh\': Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory\n```\neither run the playbook as `root` (without `become: yes` at the playbook level), or add `become: yes` to the handler.\n\nThis is a bug with Ansible: see [here](https://github.com/dev-sec/ansible-ssh-hardening/pull/81) and [here](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/17490) for more information.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [contributor guideline](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## License and Author\n\n* Author:: Sebastian Gumprich\n* Author:: Christoph Hartmann <chris@lollyrock.com>\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n[1]: http://travis-ci.org/dev-sec/ansible-ssh-hardening\n[2]: https://gitter.im/dev-sec/general\n[3]: https://galaxy.ansible.com/dev-sec/ssh-hardening/\n'
