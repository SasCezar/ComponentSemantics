DevOps?</summary><br><b>\n\nThere are many good answers to this question. I like Amazon\'s description of DevOps:\n\n"DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization\xe2\x80\x99s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market."\n\nYou can find more details here: https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What are the benefits of DevOps? What it can help us to achieve?</summary><br><b>\n\nYou should mention some or all of the following:\n\n  * Collaboration\n  * Improved delivery\n  * Security\n  * Speed\n  * Scale\n  * Reliability\n\nDetailed answer can be found here: https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops \n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What are the anti-patterns of DevOps?</summary><br><b>\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What is Continuous Integration?</summary><br><b>\n\nA development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently. It can range from a couple of changes every day or a week to a couple of changes in one hour in larger scales.\n\nEach piece of code (change/patch) is verified, to make the change is safe to merge. Today, it\'s a common practice to test the change using an automated build that makes sure the code can integrated. It can be one build which runs several tests in different levels (unit, functional, etc.) or several separate builds that all or some has to pass in order for the change to be merged into the repository.\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What is Continuous Deployment?</summary><br><b>\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What is Continuous Delivery?</summary><br><b>\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What CI/CD best practices are you familiar with? Or what do you consider as CI/CD best practice?</summary><br><b>\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What systems and/or tools are you using for the following?:\n\n  * CI/CD\n  * Provisioning infrastructure\n  * Configuration Management\n  * Monitoring & alerting - Prometheus, DataDog, Sensu, Grafana\n  * Logging - ELK (Elastic Search, Logstash, Kibana), EFK (Elastic Search, Fluentd, Kibana)\n  * Code review\n  * Code coverage\n  * Tests</summary><br><b>\n  * CI/CD - Jenkins, Circle CI, Travis\n  * Provisioning infrastructure - Terraform, CloudFormation\n  * Configuration Management - Ansible, Puppet, Chef\n  * Monitoring & alerting - Prometheus, Nagios\n  * Logging - Logstash, Graylog, Fluentd\n  * Code review - Gerrit, Review Board\n  * Code coverage - Cobertura, Clover, JaCoCo\n  * Tests - Robot, Serenity, Gauge\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What are you taking into consideration when choosing a tool/technology?</summary><br><b>\n\nIn your answer you can mention one or more of the following:\n  * mature vs. cutting edge\n  * community size\n  * architecture aspects - agent vs. agentless, master vs. masterless, etc.\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Explain mutable vs. immutable infrastructure</summary><br><b>\n\nIn mutable infrastructure paradigm, changes are applied on top of the existing infrastructure and over time\nthe infrastructure builds up a history of changes. Ansible, Puppet and Chef are examples to tools which\nfollow mutable infrastructure paradigm.\n\nIn immutable infrastructure paradigm, every change is actually new infrastructure. So a change\nto a server will result in a new server instead of updating it. Terraform is an example of technology\nwhich follows the immutable infrastructure paradigm.\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What ways are you familiar with to deliver a software? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?</summary><br><b>\n\n  * Archive - collect all your app files into one archive (e.g. tar) and deliver it to the user.\n  * Package - depends on the OS, you can use your OS package format (e.g. in RHEL/Fefodra it\'s RPM) to deliver your software with a way to install, uninstall and update it using the standard packager commands\n  * Images - Either VM or container images where your package is included with everything it needs in order to run successfully.\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What is caching? How it works? Why is it important?</summary><br><b>\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Explain stateless vs. stateful</summary><br><b>\n\nStateless applications don\'t store any data in the host which makes it ideal for horizontal scaling and microservices.\nStateful applications depend on the storage to save state and data, typically databases are stateful applications.\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What is HTTP and how it works?</summary><br><b>\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Describe the workflow of setting up some type of web server (Apache, IIS, Tomact, ...)</summary><br><b>\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Explain "Open Source"</summary><br><b>\n</b></details>\n\n##### SRE\n\n<details>\n<summary>Compare SRE to DevOps</summary><br><b>\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What SRE team is responsible for?</summary><br><b>\n\nOne can argue whether it\'s per company definition or a global one but at least according to a large companies, like Google for example, the SRE team is responsible for availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning of their services\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What is an error budget?</summary><br><b>\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What are MTTF (mean time to failure) and MTTR (mean time to repair)?

In order to be ACID compliant, the database much meet each of the four criteria\n\n**Atomicity** - When a change occurs to the database, it should either succeed or fail as a whole. \n\nFor example, if you were to update a table, the update should completely execute. If it only partially executes, the \nupdate is considered failed as a whole, and will not go through - the DB will revert back to it\'s original\nstate before the update occurred. It should also be mentioned that Atomicity ensures that each \ntransaction is completed as it\'s own stand alone "unit" - if any part fails, the whole statement fails.\n\n**Consistency** - any change made to the database should bring it from one valid state into the next.\n\nFor example, if you make a change to the DB, it shouldn\'t corrupt it. Consistency is upheld by checks and constraints that\nare pre-defined in the DB. For example, if you tried to change a value from a string to an int when the column\nshould be of datatype string, a consistent DB would not allow this transaction to go through, and the action would\nnot be executed\n\n**Isolation** - this ensures that a database will never be seen "mid-update" - as multiple transactions are running at\nthe same time, it should still leave the DB in the same state as if the transactions were being run sequentially.\n\nFor example, let\'s say that 20 other people were making changes to the database at the same time. At the\ntime you executed your query, 15 of the 20 changes had gone through, but 5 were still in progress. You should\nonly see the 15 changes that had completed - you wouldn\'t see the database mid-update as the change goes through.\n\n**Durability** - Once a change is committed, it will remain committed regardless of what happens\n(power failure, system crash, etc.). This means that all completed transactions \nmust be recorded in non-volatile memory. \n\nNote that SQL is by nature ACID compliant. Certain NoSQL DB\'s can be ACID compliant depending on \nhow they operate, but as a general rule of thumb, NoSQL DB\'s are not considered ACID compliant\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>When is it best to use SQL? NoSQL?</summary><br><b>\n\nSQL - Best used when data integrity is crucial. SQL is typically implemented with many\nbusinesses and areas within the finance field due to it\'s ACID compliance.\n\nNoSQL - Great if you need to scale things quickly. NoSQL was designed with web applications \nin mind, so it works great if you need to quickly spread the same information around to \nmultiple servers\n\nAdditionally, since NoSQL does not adhere to the strict table with columns and rows structure\nthat Relational Databases require, you can store different data types together.\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What is a Cartesian Product?</summary><br>\n\nA Cartesian product is when all rows from the first table are joined to all rows in the second\ntable. This can be done implicitly by not defining a key to join, or explicitly by \ncalling a CROSS JOIN on two tables, such as below:\n\nSelect * from customers **CROSS JOIN** orders;\n\nNote that a Cartesian product can also be a bad thing - when performing a join\non two tables in which both do not have unique keys, this could cause the returned information\nto be incorrect. \n</details>\n\n##### SQL Specific Questions\n\nFor these questions, we will be using the Customers and Orders tables shown below:\n\n**Customers**\n\nCustomer_ID | Customer_Name | Items_in_cart | Cash_spent_to_Date\n------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------\n100204 | John Smith | 0 | 20.00\n100205 | Jane Smith | 3 | 40.00\n100206 | Bobby Frank | 1 | 100.20\n\n**ORDERS**\n\nCustomer_ID | Order_ID | Item | Price | Date_sold\n------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------\n100206 | A123 | Rubber Ducky | 2.20 | 2019-09-18\n100206 | A123 | Bubble Bath | 8.00 | 2019-09-18\n100206 | Q987 | 80-Pack TP | 90.00 | 2019-09-20\n100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Tuna Fish | 10.00 | 2019-08-05\n100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Chicken | 10.00 | 2019-08-05\n100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Beef | 10.00 | 2019-08-05\n100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Kitty quesadilla | 10.00 | 2019-08-05\n100204 | X202 | Coffee | 20.00 | 2019-04-29\n\n<details>\n<summary>How would I select all fields from this table?</summary><br><b>\n\nSelect * <br>\nFrom Customers;\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>How many items are in John\'s cart?</summary><br><b>\n\nSelect Items_in_cart <br>\nFrom Customers <br>\nWhere Customer_Name = "John Smith";\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What is the sum of all the cash spent across all customers?</summary><br><b>\n\nSelect SUM(Cash_spent_to_Date) as SUM_CASH <br>\nFrom Customers;\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>How many people have items in their cart?</summary><br><b>\n\nSelect count(1) as Number_of_People_w_items <br>\nFrom Customers <br>\nwhere Items_in_cart > 0;\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>How would you join the customer table to the order table?</summary><br><b>\n\nYou would join them on the unique key. In this case, the unique key is Customer_ID in\nboth the Customers table and Orders table\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>How would you show which customer ordered which items?</summary><br><b>\n\nSelect c.Customer_Name, o.Item <br>\nFrom Customers c <br>\nLeft Join Orders o <br>\n  On c.Customer_ID = o.Customer_ID;\n\n</b></details>\n\n<a name="sql-advanced"></a>\n#### Advanced\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using a with statement, how would you show who ordered cat food, and the total amount of money spent?</summary><br><b>\n\nwith cat_food as ( <br>\nSelect Customer_ID, SUM(Price) as TOTAL_PRICE <br>\nFrom Orders <br>\nWhere Item like "%Cat Food%" <br>\nGroup by Customer_ID <br>\n) <br>\nSelect Customer_name, TOTAL_PRICE <br>\nFrom Customers c <br>\nInner JOIN cat_food f <br>\n  ON c.Customer_ID = f.Customer_ID <br>\nwhere c.Customer_ID in (Select Customer_ID from cat_food);\n\nAlthough this was a simple statement, the "with" clause really shines when \na complex query needs to be run on a table before joining to another. With statements are nice, \nbecause you create a pseudo temp when running your query, instead of creating a whole new table.\n\nThe Sum of all the purchases of cat food weren\'t readily available, so we used a with statement to create\nthe pseudo table to retrieve the sum of the prices spent by each customer, then join the table normally.\n</b></details>\n\n## Azure\n\n<a name="azure-beginner"></a>\n#### :baby: Beginner\n\n<details>\n<summary>Explain Azure\'s architecture</summary><br><b>\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Explain availability sets and availability zones</summary><br><b>\n</b></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>What is the Azure Resource Manager?
