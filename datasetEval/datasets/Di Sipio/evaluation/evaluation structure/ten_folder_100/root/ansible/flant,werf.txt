To benefit from it, you just need to describe your application\'s configuration (how to build it and deploy it into Kubernetes) in a Git repo acting as the single source of truth. In short, that\'s what we call GitOps today.\n\n* Werf builds Docker images using Dockerfiles or alternative fast builder based on the custom syntax. It also cleans Docker Registry from unused images.\n* Werf deploys your application into Kubernetes using a chart in Helm-compatible format with handy customizations and improved deploy tracking, errors detection and output.\n\nWhile werf is not a complete CI/CD system itself, it is a tool that can be embedded into any existing CI/CD system literally "connecting the dots" to implement these practices for your application. We consider it a new generation of high-level CI/CD tools.\n\n<!-- WERF DOCS PARTIAL END -->\n\n**Contents**\n\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Install Dependencies](#install-dependencies)\n  - [Install Werf](#install-werf)\n- [Backward Compatibility Promise](#backward-compatibility-promise)\n- [Docs and Support](#docs-and-support)\n- [License](#license)\n\n# Features\n\n<!-- WERF DOCS PARTIAL BEGIN: Features -->\n\n - Complete application lifecycle management: build and publish images, deploy application into Kubernetes and cleanup unused images by policies.\n - Application build and deploy specification (as many components as needed) completely described in one git repository with source code (single source of truth).\n - Build images with Dockerfiles.\n - Alternatively, build images with custom syntax to take advantage of Ansible builder and incremental rebuilds based on git history.\n - Helm 2 compatible chart and complex deploy process with logging, tracking, early errors detection and annotations to customize tracking logic of specific resources.\n - Werf is a CLI tool written in Golang which can be embedded into any existing CI/CD system to implement CI/CD for your application.\n - Cross-platform development: Linux based containers are supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\n## Coming soon\n\n- ~3-way-merge [#1616](https://github.com/flant/werf/issues/1616).~\n- Easy local development of applications with werf [#1940](https://github.com/flant/werf/issues/1940).\n- Content addressable tagging scheme [#1184](https://github.com/flant/werf/issues/1184).\n- Proven approaches and recipes for most popular CI systems [#1617](https://github.com/flant/werf/issues/1617).\n- Distributed builds with common registry [#1614](https://github.com/flant/werf/issues/1614).\n- Helm 3 support [#1606](https://github.com/flant/werf/issues/1606).\n- Userspace builds without Docker daemon (as in kaniko)[#1618](https://github.com/flant/werf/issues/1618).\n\n## Complete features list\n\n### Building\n\n- Conveniently build as many images as needed for a single project.\n- Building images by Dockerfile or Stapel builder instructions.\n- Parallel builds on a single host (using file locks).\n- Distributed builds (coming soon) [#1614](https://github.com/flant/werf/issues/1614).\n- Advanced build with Stapel:\n  - Incremental rebuilds based on git history.\n  - Building images with Ansible tasks or Shell scripts.\n  - Sharing a common cache between builds using mounts.\n  - Reducing image size by detaching source data and build tools.\n- Building one image from config on the top of another image from the same config.\n- Debug tools for build process inspection.\n- Detailed output.\n\n### Publishing\n\n- Store images in one or several Docker repositories by the following patterns:\n  - `IMAGES_REPO:[IMAGE_NAME-]TAG` using `monorepo` mode.\n  - `IMAGES_REPO[/IMAGE_NAME]:TAG` using `multirepo` mode.\n- Different image tagging strategies:\n  - Tag image by git tag, branch or commit.\n  - Content based tagging (coming soon) [#1184](https://github.com/flant/werf/issues/1184).\n\n### Deploy\n\n- Deploy an application into Kubernetes and check that application is deployed correctly.\n  - Track all application resources status.\n  - Control of resources readiness.\n  - Control of the deployment process with annotations.\n- Full visibility both of the deploy process and of the final result.\n  - Logging and error reporting.\n  - Periodical status reports during deploy process.\n  - Easy debugging of problems without unnecessary kubectl invocations.\n- Fail CI pipeline fast when problem detected.\n  - Early resources failures detection during deploy process without need to wait full timeout.\n- Full compatibility with Helm 2.\n- Ability to limit deploy user access using RBAC definition (Tiller is compiled into Werf and run from the deploy user outside of cluster).\n- Parallel deploys on a single host (using file locks).\n- Distributed parallel deploys (coming soon) [#1620](https://github.com/flant/werf/issues/1620).\n- Allow continuous delivery of new images tagged by the same name (by git branch for example).\n\n### Cleanup\n\n- Local and Docker registry cleaning by customizable policies.\n- Keeping images that used in Kubernetes clusters. Werf scans the following kinds of objects: Pod, Deployment, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob, ReplicationController.\n\n<!-- WERF DOCS PARTIAL END -->\n\n# Installation\n\n<!-- WERF DOCS PARTIAL BEGIN: Installation -->\n\n## Install Dependencies\n\n### Docker\n\n[Docker CE installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/).\n\nManage Docker as a non-root user. Create the **docker** group and add your user to the group:\n\n```bash\nsudo groupadd docker\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n```\n\n### Git command line utility\n\n[Git installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\n\n- Minimal required version is 1.9.0.\n- To optionally use [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitsubmodules) minimal version is 2.14.0.\n\n## Install Werf\n\n### Method 1 (recommended): using Multiwerf\n\n[Multiwerf](https://github.com/flant/multiwerf) is a version manager for Werf, which:\n* downloads Werf binary builds;\n* manages multiple versions of binaries installed on a single host, that can be used at the same time;\n* automatically updates Werf binary (can be disabled).\n\n```bash\n# add ~/bin into PATH\necho \'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin\' >> ~/.bashrc\nexec bash\n\n# install multiwerf into ~/bin directory\nmkdir -p ~/bin\ncd ~/bin\ncurl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flant/multiwerf/master/get.sh | bash\nsource <(multiwerf use 1.0 beta)\n```\n\n> _Note:_ If you are using bash versions before 4.0 (e.g. 3.2 is default for MacOS users), you must use `source /dev/stdin <<<"$(multiwerf use 1.0 beta)"` instead of `source <(multiwerf use 1.0 beta)`\n\n### Method 2: download binary\n\nThe latest release can be reached via [this page](https://bintray.com/flant/werf/werf/_latestVersion)\n\n##### MacOS\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://dl.bintray.com/flant/werf/v1.0.3-beta.9/werf-darwin-amd64-v1.0.3-beta.9 -o /tmp/werf\nchmod +x /tmp/werf\nsudo mv /tmp/werf /usr/local/bin/werf\n```\n\n##### Linux\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://dl.bintray.com/flant/werf/v1.0.3-beta.9/werf-linux-amd64-v1.0.3-beta.9 -o /tmp/werf\nchmod +x /tmp/werf\nsudo mv /tmp/werf /usr/local/bin/werf\n```\n\n##### Windows\n\nDownload [werf.exe](https://dl.bintray.com/flant/werf/v1.0.3-beta.9/werf-windows-amd64-v1.0.3-beta.9.exe)\n\n### Method 3: from source\n\n```\ngo get github.com/flant/werf/cmd/werf\n```\n\n<!-- WERF DOCS PARTIAL END -->\n\n# Backward Compatibility Promise\n\n<!-- WERF DOCS PARTIAL BEGIN: Backward Compatibility Promise -->\n\n> _Note:_ This promise was introduced with Werf 1.0 and does not apply to previous versions or to dapp releases.\n\nWerf is versioned with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). This means that major releases (1.0, 2.0) are\nallowed to break backward compatibility. In case of Werf this means that update to the next major release _may_\nrequire to do a full re-deploy of applications or to perform other non-scriptable actions.\n\nMinor releases (1.1, 1.2, etc.) may introduce new "big" features, but must do so without significant backward compatibility breaks with major branch (1.x).\nIn case of Werf this means that update to the next minor release is mostly smooth, but _may_ require to run a provided upgrade script.\n\nPatch releases (1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2) may introduce new features, but must do so without breaking backward compatibility with minor branch (1.1.x).\nIn case of Werf this means that update to the next patch release should be smooth and can be done automatically.\n\nPatch releases are divided to channels. Channel is a prefix in a prerelease part of version (1.1.0-alpha.2, 1.1.0-beta.3, 1.1.0-ea.1).\nVersion without prerelease part is considered to be from a stable channel.\n\n- `stable` channel (1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.). This is a general available version and recommended for usage in critical environments with tight SLA.\n  We **guarantee** backward compatibility between `stable` releases within minor branch (1.1.x).\n- `ea` channel versions are mostly safe to use and we encourage to use this version everywhere.\n  We **guarantee** backward compatibility between `ea` releases within minor branch (1.1.x).\n  We **guarantee** that `ea` release should become a `stable` release not earlier than 2 weeks of broad testing.\n- `rc` channel (2.3.2-rc.2). These releases are mostly safe to use and can even be used in non critical environments or for local development.\n  We do **not guarantee** backward compatibility between `rc` releases.\n  We **guarantee** that `rc` release should become `ea` not earlier than 1 week after internal tests.\n- `beta` channel (1.2.2-beta.0). These releases are for more broad testing of new features to catch regressions.\n  We do **not guarantee** backward compatibility between `beta` releases.\n- `alpha` channel (1.2.2-alpha.12, 2.0.0-alpha.5, etc.). These releases can bring new features, but are unstable.\n  We do **not guarantee** backward compatibility between `alpha` releases.\n\n<!-- WERF DOCS PARTIAL END -->\n\n# Docs and support\n\n<!-- WERF DOCS PARTIAL BEGIN: Docs and support -->\n\n[Make your first Werf application](https://werf.io/documentation/guides/getting_started.html) or plunge into the complete [documentation](https://werf.io/).\n\nWerf\xe2\x80\x99s developers are always in contact with community though Slack and Telegram.
