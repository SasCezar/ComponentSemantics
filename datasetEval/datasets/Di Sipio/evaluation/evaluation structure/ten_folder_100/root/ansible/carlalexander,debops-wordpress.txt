b'![DebOps for WordPress](https://cldup.com/7ODJOzazxd-3000x3000.jpeg)\n\n# DebOps for WordPress\n\n"DebOps for WordPress" is a tool that gives anyone in the WordPress community\naccess to a fast and secure WordPress server. It\'s meant to be easy to use and\nrequire little to no system administrator knowledge.\n\nIt takes care of everything for you. It does more than just install WordPress for you. It\nalso takes care of all server configuration and maintenance tasks.\n\nAll that you need to do is type in three commands (after installation) and wait for the magic to happen.\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/carlalexander/debops-wordpress/wiki) for full documentation,\nexamples and other information.\n\n## Installation\n\n*If you\'ve never used DebOps or Ansible before, please refer to the "[Installation](https://github.com/carlalexander/debops-wordpress/wiki/Installation)" page of the wiki.*\n\nTo create a "DebOps for WordPress" project, you just need to:\n\n 1. Get a copy of this repo to your computer.\n 2. Make sure that DebOps is up to date by running `debops-update`.\n\n## Usage\n\n*If you\'ve never used DebOps or Ansible before, please refer to the "[Configuring your server](https://github.com/carlalexander/debops-wordpress/wiki/Configuring-your-server)" page of the wiki.*\n\nTo configure a server, you need to add it to the `hosts` file in the `inventory` folder\nunder both the `[debops_all_hosts]` and `[wordpress]`.\n\n```ini\n# inventory/hosts\n\n[debops_all_hosts]\nwordpress.example.com\n\n[wordpress]\nwordpress.example.com\n```\n\nOnce that\'s done, you just need to run three commands. Each of them can take several minutes to run.\n\n```bash\n$ debops bootstrap -u root\n$ debops\n$ debops wordpress\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nDebOps is the real cornerstone of this project. This project wouldn\'t exists without the amazing work done\nby [Maciej Delmanowski](https://github.com/drybjed).\n\nA lot of the initial inspiration for the roles came from WPEngine\'s [Mecury project](https://github.com/wpengine/hgv)\nand [the port](https://github.com/zach-adams/hgv-deploy-full) done by [Zach Adams](http://zach-adams.com/).\n\nThe [default Varnish configuration](https://github.com/mattiasgeniar/varnish-5.0-configuration-templates) work by\n[Mattias Geniar](http://ma.ttias.be/) was critical to get a solid foundation for Varnish in WordPress.\n'
