b'Configuration Management\n########################\n\nThis repository is a collection of tools and scripts that edx.org uses to deploy \nopenedx. The purpose of this repository is to share portions of our toolchain\nwith the community. This repository is *not* the best way to get started running \nopenedx. For that, please look at `Open EdX Installation options`_, which contains\nlinks to the recommended paths for new installations.\n\n**Important**: The Open edX configuration scripts need to be run as root on\nyour servers and will make changes to service configurations including, but not\nlimited to, sshd, dhclient, sudo, apparmor and syslogd. Our scripts are made\navailable as we use them and they implement our best practices. We strongly\nrecommend that you review everything that these scripts will do before running\nthem against your servers. We also recommend against running them against\nservers that are hosting other applications. No warranty is expressed or\nimplied.\n\nFor more information including installation instructions please see the `OpenEdX\nWiki`_.\n\nFor info on any large recent changes please see the `change log`_.\n\nWhat is in this Repo?\n*********************\n\n* `playbooks </playbooks>`__: This directory contains ansible playbooks that can\n  be used to configure individual services in the openedx platform. See\n  `Open EdX Installation options`_ before trying to use any of the scripts in\n  this directory.\n* `docker </docker>`__: This directory contains dockerfiles that can be used to \n  test that playbooks execute cleanly.  See `Makefiles <Makefiles.rst>`__ for\n  Documentation on how to run these containers.\n* `requirements </requirements>`__ : inputs for `pip-compile <https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools>`__\n  Update files in this directory and then run ``make upgrade`` to update\n  ``requirements.txt``\n* `tests </tests>`__: scripts used by travis-ci to test changes to this repo\n* `util </util>`__: one-off scripts or tools used to perform certain functions\n  related to openedx management.\n* `vagrant </vagrant>`__: vagrant tooling for testing changes to this repo.\n\n\nRoadmap\n*******\n\nThis repository is in ``sustained`` status.  The goal is to deprecate this codebase\nand move the deployment code into the repos with the application code. \n\nWith the adoption of containerized application platforms like `Kubernetes \n<https://kubernetes.io/>`__, the tools in this repository are complex \nand inappropriate for building small single purpose containers.\n\nAt edx.org, we are focusing on deployment of applications using `Terraform \n<https://www.terraform.io/>`__ and `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`__.  We\nhope to provide open source tooling for this soon.\n\n\nContributing\n************\n\n* Bugfixes: If you would like to contribute a bugfix to this codebase, please open\n  a pull request. A bot will automatically walk your contribution through the \n  `Open Source Contribution process <https://edx-developer-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/overview.html>`__.\n\n\n.. _Open EdX Installation options: https://open.edx.org/installation-options\n.. _Ansible: http://ansible.com/\n.. _OpenEdX Wiki: https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OpenOPS/Open+edX+Operations+Home\n.. _change log: https://github.com/edx/configuration/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n'
