At the end of the tutorial, I summarize some of the key points about Infrastructure as Code based on what you learn through the labs.\n\nThis tutorial is not meant to give a complete guide on how to use a specific tool like Ansible or Terraform, instead it focuses on how these tools work in general and what problems they solve.\n\n> The tutorial was inspired by [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) tutorial. I used it as an example to structure this one.\n\n_See [my presentation at DevOpsDays Silicon Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbcW2B7roLo&t=) in which I talk more in depth about the tutorial._\n\n## Target Audience\n\nThe target audience for this tutorial is anyone who loves or/and works in IT.\n\n## Tools Covered\n\n* Packer\n* Terraform\n* Ansible\n* Vagrant\n* Docker\n* Docker Compose\n* Kubernetes\n\n## Results of completing the tutorial\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you'll make your own repository looking like [this one](https://github.com/Artemmkin/infrastructure-as-code-example).\n\nNOTE: you can use this [example repository](https://github.com/Artemmkin/infrastructure-as-code-example) in case you get stuck in some of the labs.\n\n## Labs\n\nThis tutorial assumes you have access to the Google Cloud Platform. While GCP is used for basic infrastructure requirements the lessons learned in this tutorial can be applied to other platforms.\n\n* [Introduction](docs/00-introduction.md)\n* [Prerequisites](docs/01-prerequisites.md)\n* [Manual Operations](docs/02-manual-operations.md)\n* [Scripts](docs/03-scripts.md)\n* [Packer](docs/04-packer.md)\n* [Terraform](docs/05-terraform.md)\n* [Ansible](docs/06-ansible.md)\n* [Vagrant](docs/07-vagrant.md)\n* [Docker](docs/08-docker.md)\n* [Docker Compose](docs/09-docker-compose.md)\n* [Kubernetes](docs/10-kubernetes.md)\n* [What is Infrastructure as Code?](docs/50-what-is-iac.md)\n"
