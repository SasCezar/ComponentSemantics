b'## introduction\n\nThis is a vim syntax plugin for Ansible 2.x, it supports YAML playbooks, Jinja2 templates, and Ansible\'s `hosts` files.\n\n- YAML playbooks are detected if:\n  - they are in the `group_vars` or `host_vars` folder\n  - they are in the `tasks`, `roles`, or `handlers` folder and have either a *.yml* or *.yaml* suffix\n  - they are named `playbook.y(a)ml`, `site.y(a)ml`, or `main.y(a)ml`\n- Jinja2 templates are detected if they have a *.j2* suffix\n- Files named `hosts` will be treated as Ansible hosts files\n\nYou can also set the filetype to `yaml.ansible`, `*.jinja2`, or `ansible_hosts` if auto-detection does not work (e.g. `:set ft=yaml.ansible` or `:set ft=ruby.jinja2`). **Note**: If you want to detect a custom pattern of your own, you can easily add this in your `.vimrc` using something like this:\n\n```vim\nau BufRead,BufNewFile */playbooks/*.yml set filetype=yaml.ansible\n```\n\nIf you want to override the default file type detection you can easily do this in your `.vimrc`. For example if you use YAML syntax for `hosts` include something like this:\n\n```vim\naugroup ansible_vim_fthosts\n  autocmd!\n  autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead hosts setfiletype yaml.ansible\naugroup END\n```\n\nThis plugin should be quite reliable, as it sources the original formats and simply modifies the highlights as appropriate. This also enables a focus on simplicity and configurability instead of patching bad syntax detection.\n\n##### examples (with [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) colorscheme)\n\nBright (and selective highlight)     |  Dim\n:-----------------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n![](http://i.imgur.com/whBOZZK.png)  |  ![](http://i.imgur.com/XS0T00e.png)\n\n##### installation\n\nUse your favorite plugin manager, or try [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) if you\'re looking for a really nice one!\n\n**vim-plug:** `Plug \'pearofducks/ansible-vim\'`\n\n**vim-plug with post-update hook:** `Plug \'pearofducks/ansible-vim\', { \'do\':\n\'./UltiSnips/generate.sh\' }`\n\n*Note: Because of Ansible API changes, `generate.sh` may require the latest (or near-latest) version of Ansible.*\n\n*Note2: `generate.sh` can receive some parameters, for more info see its [Readme](https://github.com/pearofducks/ansible-vim/tree/master/UltiSnips#script-parameters)*\n\n**vundle:** `Plugin \'pearofducks/ansible-vim\'`\n\n**pathogen:** `git clone https://github.com/pearofducks/ansible-vim ~/.vim/bundle/ansible-vim`\n\n**Arch Linux:** Package [ansible-vim-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ansible-vim-git/) available on AUR\n\n## options\n\n##### g:ansible_unindent_after_newline\n\n`let g:ansible_unindent_after_newline = 1`\n\nWhen this variable is set, indentation will completely reset (unindent to column 0) after two newlines in insert-mode. The normal behavior of YAML is to always keep the previous indentation, even across multiple newlines with no content.\n\n##### g:ansible_yamlKeyName\n\n`let g:ansible_yamlKeyName = \'yamlKey\'`\n\nThis option exists to provide additional compatibility with [stephpy/vim-yaml](https://github.com/stephpy/vim-yaml).\n\n##### g:ansible_attribute_highlight\n`let g:ansible_attribute_highlight = "ob"`\n\nAnsible modules use a `key=value` format for specifying module-attributes in playbooks. This highlights those as specified. This highlight option is also used when highlighting key/value pairs in `hosts` files.\n\nAvailable flags (bold are defaults):\n\n- **a**: highlight *all* instances of `key=`\n- o: highlight *only* instances of `key=` found on newlines\n- **d**: *dim* the instances of `key=` found\n- b: *brighten* the instances of `key=` found\n- n: turn this highlight off completely\n\n##### g:ansible_name_highlight\n`let g:ansible_name_highlight = \'d\'`\n\nAnsible modules commonly start with a `name:` key for self-documentation of playbooks. This option enables/changes highlight of this.\n\nAvailable flags (this feature is off by default):\n\n- d: *dim* the instances of `name:` found\n- b: *brighten* the instances of `name:` found\n\n##### g:ansible_extra_keywords_highlight\n`let g:ansible_extra_keywords_highlight = 1`\n\n*Note:* This option is enabled when set, and disabled when not set.\n\nHighlight the following additional keywords in playbooks: `register always_run changed_when failed_when no_log args vars delegate_to ignore_errors`\n\nBy default we only highlight: `include until retries delay when only_if become become_user block rescue always notify`\n\n##### g:ansible_normal_keywords_highlight\n`let g:ansible_normal_keywords_highlight = \'Constant\'`\n\nAccepts any syntax group name from `:help E669` - e.g. _Comment_, _Constant_, and _Identifier_\n\n*Note:* Defaults to \'Statement\' when not set.\n\nThis option change the highlight of the following common keywords in playbooks: `include until retries delay when only_if become become_user block rescue always notify`\n\n##### g:ansible_with_keywords_highlight\n`let g:ansible_with_keywords_highlight = \'Constant\'`\n\nAccepts any syntax group-name from `:help E669` - e.g. _Comment_, _Constant_, and _Identifier_\n\n*Note:* Defaults to \'Statement\' when not set.\n\nThis option changes the highlight of all `with_.+` keywords in playbooks.\n\n##### g:ansible_template_syntaxes\n`let g:ansible_template_syntaxes = { \'*.rb.j2\': \'ruby\' }`\n\nAccepts a dictionary in the form of `\'regex-for-file\': \'filetype\'`.\n- _regex-for-file_ will receive the full filepath, so directory matching can be done.\n- _filetype_ is the root filetype to be applied, `jinja2` will be automatically appended\n\nAll files ending in `*.j2` that aren\'t matched will simply get the `jinja2` filetype.\n\n## bugs, suggestions/requests, & contributions\n\n##### bugs\n\nIt\'s unlikely that there will be bugs in highlighting that don\'t exist in the core format. Where appropriate these will be fixed in this plugin, but if the problem is with the original syntax we should probably focus on fixing that instead.\n\nIndenting a full document - e.g with `gg=G` - will not be supported and is not a goal of this plugin (unless someone else develops it!). Please do not file a bug report on this.\n\n##### suggestions/requests\n\nSuggestions for improvements are welcome, pull-requests with completed features even more so. :)\n'
