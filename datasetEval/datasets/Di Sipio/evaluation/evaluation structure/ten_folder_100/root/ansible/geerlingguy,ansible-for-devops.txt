b"# Ansible for DevOps Examples\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops)\n\nThis repository contains Ansible examples developed to support different sections of [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/), a book on [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) by [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/).\n\nMost of the examples are full-fledged VM examples, which use Vagrant, VirtualBox, and Ansible to boot and configure VMs on your local workstation. Not all playbooks follow all of Ansible's best practices, as they illustrate particular Ansible features in an instructive manner.\n\nFor more interesting examples of what you can do with Ansible, please see the [Ansible Vagrant Examples](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-vagrant-examples) repository, and browse through some of [geerlingguy's roles on Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Buy the Book\n\n[![Ansible for DevOps Cover](https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops/medium)](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/)\n\nBuy [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/) for your e-reader or in paperback format.\n"
