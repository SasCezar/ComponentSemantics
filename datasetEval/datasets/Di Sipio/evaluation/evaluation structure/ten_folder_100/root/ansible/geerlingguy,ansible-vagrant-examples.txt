b"# Ansible Vagrant Examples\n\nThis repository contains a collection of example virtual machines running various applications. The VMs are created via Vagrant and provisioned via Ansible.\n\nYou can `cd` into any of the included directories and run `vagrant up`, and a generic Linux VM will be booted and configured in a few minutes. You just need to install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), and [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/). View the included README.md file in any of the subdirectories to find out more about the particular VM.\n\nAll of these examples use a combination of [roles I've added to Ansible Galaxy](https://servercheck.in/blog/using-ansible-galaxy), and were created to help demonstrate Ansible's simplicity and flexibility.\n\nRead more about Ansible and how I use it to manage infrastructure in [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/), a book I've written.\n\n# VMs/Apps Currently Present\n\n  - **AWX** (`awx` - Ansible AWX (CI/CD system for running Ansible playbooks)\n  - **Docker** (`docker` - Docker container building and management (builds a simple LAMP stack).\n  - **Drupal** (`drupal` - LAMP/LEMP-based Content Management System)\n  - **ELK** (`elk` - Log monitoring (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and forwarding (Logstash forwarder))\n  - **GitLab** (`gitlab` - Ruby-based GitHub-like Git web interface)\n  - **GlusterFS** (`gluster` - A robust distributed filesystem)\n  - **Gogs** (`gogs` - Go-based GitHub-like Git web interface)\n  - **Jenkins** (`jenkins` - Java-based Continuous Integration server)\n  - **LAMP** (`lamp` - Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP)\n  - **LEMP** (`lemp` - Linux Nginx, MySQL, and PHP-fpm)\n  - **Munin** (`munin` - Munin and munin-node monitoring server)\n  - **Node.js** (`nodejs` - Node.js-based API app using restify)\n  - **Phergie** (`phergie` - PHP IRC Bot)\n  - **Rails** (`rails` - Ruby on Rails demo app running on Passenger/Nginx)\n  - **Apache Solr** (`solr` - Java-based text search service)\n  - **SonarQube** (`sonarqube` - Java-based code quality analysis and review tool)\n  - **SVN** (`svn` - An SVN server using Apache for a web interface)\n  - **Svn2Git** (`svn2git` - A VM which includes KDE's Svn2Git for repository conversions)\n\n## License\n\nMIT license.\n\n## Author Information\n\nCreated in 2014 by [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/), author of [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/).\n\n"
