It\'s an Ansible port for Capistrano.\n\n- [Ansistrano](#ansistrano)\n  - [History](#history)\n  - [Project name](#project-name)\n  - [Ansistrano anonymous usage stats](#ansistrano-anonymous-usage-stats)\n  - [Who is using Ansistrano?](#who-is-using-ansistrano)\n  - [Requirements](#requirements)\n  - [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Update](#update)\n  - [Features](#features)\n  - [Main workflow](#main-workflow)\n  - [Role Variables](#role-variables)\n  - [Deploying](#deploying)\n  - [Rolling back](#rolling-back)\n  - [Hooks: Custom tasks](#hooks-custom-tasks)\n  - [Variables in custom tasks](#variables-in-custom-tasks)\n  - [Pruning old releases](#pruning-old-releases)\n  - [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)\n  - [Sample projects](#sample-projects)\n  - [They\'re talking about us](#theyre-talking-about-us)\n  - [License](#license)\n  - [Other resources](#other-resources)\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n[Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/) is a remote server automation tool and it\'s currently in Version 3. [Version 2.0](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/tree/legacy-v2) was originally thought in order to deploy RoR applications. With additional plugins, you were able to deploy non Rails applications such as PHP and Python, with different deployment strategies, stages and much more. I loved Capistrano v2. I have used it a lot. I developed a plugin for it.\n\nCapistrano 2 was a great tool and it still works really well. However, it is not maintained anymore since the original team is working in v3. This new version does not have the same set of features so it is less powerful and flexible. Besides that, other new tools are becoming easier to use in order to deploy applications, such as Ansible.\n\nSo, I have decided to stop using Capistrano because v2 is not maintained, v3 does not have enough features, and I can do everything Capistrano was doing with Ansible. If you are looking for alternatives, check Fabric or Chef Solo.\n\nProject name\n------------\n\nAnsistrano comes from Ansible + Capistrano, easy, isn\'t it?\n\nAnsistrano anonymous usage stats\n--------------------------------\n\nWe have recently added an extra optional step in Ansistrano so that we can know how many people are deploying their applications with our project. Unfortunately, Ansible Galaxy does not provide any numbers on usage or downloads so this is one of the only ways we have to measure how many users we really have.\n\nYou can check the code we use to store your anonymous stats at [the ansistrano.com repo](https://github.com/ansistrano/ansistrano.com) and anyway, if you are not comfortable with this, you will always be able to disable this extra step by setting `ansistrano_allow_anonymous_stats` to false in your playbooks.\n\nWho is using Ansistrano?\n------------------------\n\nIs Ansistrano ready to be used?

Check [ansible inventory documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_inventory.html) if you need help. This file will identify all the hosts where to deploy to. For multistage environments check [Multistage environments](#multistage-environment-devel-preprod-prod-etc).\n* Create a new playbook for deploying your app, for example, `deploy.yml`\n* Set up role variables (see [Role Variables](#role-variables))\n* Include the `ansistrano.deploy` role as part of a play\n* Run the deployment playbook\n\n```ansible-playbook -i hosts deploy.yml```\n\nIf everything has been set up properly, this command will create the following approximate directory structure on your server. Check how the hosts folder structure would look like after one, two and three deployments.\n\n```\n-- /var/www/my-app.com\n|-- current -> /var/www/my-app.com/releases/20100509145325\n|-- releases\n|   |-- 20100509145325\n|-- shared\n```\n\n```\n-- /var/www/my-app.com\n|-- current -> /var/www/my-app.com/releases/20100509150741\n|-- releases\n|   |-- 20100509150741\n|   |-- 20100509145325\n|-- shared\n```\n\n```\n-- /var/www/my-app.com\n|-- current -> /var/www/my-app.com/releases/20100512131539\n|-- releases\n|   |-- 20100512131539\n|   |-- 20100509150741\n|   |-- 20100509145325\n|-- shared\n```\n\n### Serial deployments\n\nTo prevent different timestamps when deploying to several servers using the [`serial`](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_delegation.html#rolling-update-batch-size) option, you should set the `ansistrano_release_version` variable.\n\n```ansible-playbook -i hosts -e "ansistrano_release_version=`date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%SZ`" deploy.yml```\n\n\nRolling back\n-----------\n\nIn order to rollback with Ansistrano, you need to set up the deployment and run the rollback playbook.\n\n```ansible-playbook -i hosts rollback.yml```\n\nIf you try to rollback with zero or one releases deployed, an error will be raised and no actions performed.\n\nVariables you can tune in rollback role are less than in deploy one:\n\n```yaml\nvars:\n  ansistrano_deploy_to: "/var/www/my-app" # Base path to deploy to.\n  ansistrano_version_dir: "releases" # Releases folder name\n  ansistrano_current_dir: "current" # Softlink name. You should rarely changed it.\n  ansistrano_rollback_to_release: "" # If specified, the application will be rolled back to this release version; previous release otherwise.\n  ansistrano_remove_rolled_back: yes # You can change this setting in order to keep the rolled back release in the server for later inspection\n  ansistrano_allow_anonymous_stats: yes\n\n  # Hooks: custom tasks if you need them\n  ansistrano_rollback_before_setup_tasks_file: "{{ playbook_dir }}/<your-deployment-config>/my-rollback-before-setup-tasks.yml"\n  ansistrano_rollback_after_setup_tasks_file: "{{ playbook_dir }}/<your-deployment-config>/my-rollback-after-setup-tasks.yml"\n  ansistrano_rollback_before_symlink_tasks_file: "{{ playbook_dir }}/<your-deployment-config>/my-rollback-before-symlink-tasks.yml"\n  ansistrano_rollback_after_symlink_tasks_file: "{{ playbook_dir }}/<your-deployment-config>/my-rollback-after-symlink-tasks.yml"\n  ansistrano_rollback_before_cleanup_tasks_file: "{{ playbook_dir }}/<your-deployment-config>/my-rollback-before-cleanup-tasks.yml"\n  ansistrano_rollback_after_cleanup_tasks_file: "{{ playbook_dir }}/<your-deployment-config>/my-rollback-after-cleanup-tasks.yml"\n```\n\nMultistage environment (devel, preprod, prod, etc.)\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you want to deploy to different environments such as devel, preprod and prod, it\'s recommended to create different hosts files. When done, you can specify a different host file when running the deployment playbook using the **-i** parameter. On every host file, you can specify different users, password, connection parameters, etc.\n\n```ansible-playbook -i hosts_devel deploy.yml```\n\n```ansible-playbook -i hosts_preprod deploy.yml```\n\n```ansible-playbook -i hosts_prod deploy.yml```\n\nHooks: Custom tasks\n-------------------\n\nYou will typically need to reload your webserver after the `Symlink` step, or download your dependencies before `Code update` or even do it in production before the `Symlink`. So, in order to perform your custom tasks you have some hooks that Ansistrano will execute before and after each of the main 3 steps. **This is the main benefit against other similar deployment roles.**\n\n```\n-- /my-local-machine/my-app.com\n|-- hosts\n|-- deploy.yml\n|-- my-custom-tasks\n|   |-- before-code-update.yml\n|   |-- after-code-update.yml\n|   |-- before-symlink.yml\n|   |-- after-symlink.yml\n|   |-- before-cleanup.yml\n|   |-- after-cleanup.yml\n```\n\nFor example, in order to restart apache after `Symlink` step, we\'ll add in the `after-symlink.yml`\n\n```\n- name: Restart Apache\n  service: name=httpd state=reloaded\n```\n\n* **Q: Where would you add sending email notification after a deployment?**\n* **Q: (for PHP and Symfony developers) Where would you clean the cache?**\n\nYou can specify a custom tasks file for before and after every step using `ansistrano_before_*_tasks_file` and `ansistrano_after_*_tasks_file` role variables. See "Role Variables" for more information.\n\nVariables in custom tasks\n-------------------------\n\nWhen writing your custom tasks files you may need some variables that Ansistrano makes available to you:\n\n* ```{{ ansistrano_release_path.stdout }}```: Path to current deployment release (probably the one you are going to use the most)\n* ```{{ ansistrano_releases_path }}```: Path to releases folder\n* ```{{ ansistrano_shared_path }}```: Path to shared folder (where common releases assets can be stored)\n* ```{{ ansistrano_release_version }}```: Relative directory name for the release (by default equals to the current timestamp in UTC timezone)\n\nPruning old releases\n--------------------\n\nIn continuous delivery environments, you will possibly have a high number of releases in production. Maybe you have tons of space and you don\'t mind, but it\'s common practice to keep just a custom number of releases.\n\nAfter the deployment, if you want to remove old releases just set the `ansistrano_keep_releases` variable to the total number of releases you want to keep.\n\nLet\'s see three deployments with an `ansistrano_keep_releases: 2` configuration:\n\n```\n-- /var/www/my-app.com\n|-- current -> /var/www/my-app.com/releases/20100509145325\n|-- releases\n|   |-- 20100509145325\n|-- shared\n```\n\n```\n-- /var/www/my-app.com\n|-- current -> /var/www/my-app.com/releases/20100509150741\n|-- releases\n|   |-- 20100509150741\n|   |-- 20100509145325\n|-- shared\n```\n\n```\n-- /var/www/my-app.com\n|-- current -> /var/www/my-app.com/releases/20100512131539\n|-- releases\n|   |-- 20100512131539\n|   |-- 20100509150741\n|-- shared\n```\n\nSee how the release `20100509145325` has been removed.\n\nExample Playbook\n----------------\n\nIn the folder, `example` you can check an example project that shows how to deploy a small application with Ansistrano.\n\nIn order to run it, you will need to have Vagrant and the ansistrano roles installed. Please check https://www.vagrantup.com for more information about Vagrant and our Installation section.\n\n```\n$ cd example/my-playbook\n$ vagrant up\n$ ansible-playbook -i hosts deploy.yml\n```\n\nAnd after running these commands, the index.html located in the `my-app` folder will be deployed to both vagrant boxes\n\nIn order to test the rollback playbook, you will need to run deploy.yml at least twice (so that there is something to rollback to). And once this is done, you only need to run\n\n```\n$ ansible-playbook -i hosts rollback.yml\n```\n\nYou can check more advanced examples inside the test folder which are run against Travis-CI\n\nSample projects\n---------------\n\nWe have added Ansistrano support for other projects we are working on.\n\n* LastWishes: Domain-Driven Design PHP Sample App: https://github.com/dddinphp/last-wishes\n\nAs an example, see the execution log of the LastWishes deployment:\n\n```\nPLAY [Deploy last wishes app to my server] ************************************\n\nGATHERING FACTS ***************************************************************\nok: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Ensure deployment base path exists] ***\nok: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Ensure releases folder exists] ***\nok: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Ensure shared elements folder exists] ***\nok: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Get release timestamp] ***********\nchanged: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Get release path] ****************\nchanged: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Get releases path] ***************\nchanged: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Get shared path (in rsync case)] ***\nchanged: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Rsync application files to remote shared copy (in rsync case)] ***\nchanged: [quepimquepam.com -> 127.0.0.1]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Deploy existing code to servers] ***\nchanged: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Deploy existing code to remote servers] ***\nskipping: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Update remote repository] ********\nskipping: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Export a copy of the repo] *******\nskipping: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Deploy code from to servers] *****\nskipping: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Copy release version into REVISION file] ***\nchanged: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Touches up the release code] *****\nchanged: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Change softlink to new release] ***\nchanged: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Reload Apache] *******************\nchanged: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nTASK: [ansistrano.deploy | Clean up releases] ***************\nskipping: [quepimquepam.com]\n\nPLAY RECAP ********************************************************************\nquepimquepam.com           : ok=14   changed=10   unreachable=0    failed=0\n```\n\nThey\'re talking about us\n------------------------\n\n* [Pablo Godel - Deploying Symfony - Symfony Cat 2016](https://youtu.be/K2bBhrkmpSg?t=26m)\n* [https://www.artansoft.com/2016/05/deploy-de-proyectos-php-ansistrano/](https://www.artansoft.com/2016/05/deploy-de-proyectos-php-ansistrano/)\n* [http://alexmoreno.net/ansistrano-deploying-drupal-ansible](http://alexmoreno.net/ansistrano-deploying-drupal-ansible)\n* [http://www.ricardclau.com/2015/10/deploying-php-applications-with-ansistrano/](http://www.ricardclau.com/2015/10/deploying-php-applications-with-ansistrano/)\n* [http://es.slideshare.net/OrestesCA/ansible-intro-ansible-barcelona-user-group-june-2015](http://es.slideshare.net/OrestesCA/ansible-intro-ansible-barcelona-user-group-june-2015)\n* [http://carlosbuenosvinos.com/deploying-symfony-and-php-apps-with-ansistrano/](http://carlosbuenosvinos.com/deploying-symfony-and-php-apps-with-ansistrano/)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPz5zPzzMZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPz5zPzzMZE)\n* [https://github.com/cbrunnkvist/ansistrano-symfony-deploy](https://github.com/cbrunnkvist/ansistrano-symfony-deploy)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/2ezzz5/rapid_rollback_with_ansible/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/2ezzz5/rapid_rollback_with_ansible/)\n* [Cookiecutting Ansible for Django](https://hacksoft.io/blog/cookiecutting-django-ansible/)\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMIT\n\nOther resources\n---------------\n\n* [Thoughts on deploying with Ansible](http://www.future500.nl/articles/2014/07/thoughts-on-deploying-with-ansible/)\n* [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/lavoweb/ansistrano/)\n'
