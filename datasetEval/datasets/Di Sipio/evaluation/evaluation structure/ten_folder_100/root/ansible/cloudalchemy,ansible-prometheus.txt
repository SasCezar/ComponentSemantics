More in [2.4.1 release notes](https://github.com/cloudalchemy/ansible-prometheus/releases/tag/2.4.1)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Ansible >= 2.7 (It might work on previous versions, but we cannot guarantee it)\n- jmespath on deployer machine. If you are using Ansible from a Python virtualenv, install *jmespath* to the same virtualenv via pip.\n- gnu-tar on Mac deployer host (`brew install gnu-tar`)\n\n## Role Variables\n\nAll variables which can be overridden are stored in [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) file as well as in table below.\n\n| Name           | Default Value | Description                        |\n| -------------- | ------------- | -----------------------------------|\n| `prometheus_version` | 2.14.0 | Prometheus package version. Also accepts `latest` as parameter. Only prometheus 2.x is supported |\n| `prometheus_binaries_local_dir` | "" | Allows to use local packages instead of ones distributed on github. As parameter it takes a directory where `prometheus` AND `promtool` binaries are stored on host on which ansible is ran. This overrides `prometheus_version` parameter |\n| `prometheus_config_dir` | /etc/prometheus | Path to directory with prometheus configuration |\n| `prometheus_db_dir` | /var/lib/prometheus | Path to directory with prometheus database |\n| `prometheus_web_listen_address` | "0.0.0.0:9090" | Address on which prometheus will be listening |\n| `prometheus_web_external_url` | "" | External address on which prometheus is available.

Where file names are composed from top-level keys in that map with `.yml` suffix. Those files store [file_sd scrape targets data](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#file_sd_config) and they need to be read in `prometheus_scrape_configs`.\n\n#### Long version\n\nA part of *prometheus.yml* configuration file which describes what is scraped by prometheus is stored in `prometheus_scrape_configs`. For this variable same configuration options as described in [prometheus docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#<scrape_config>) are used.\n\nMeanwhile `prometheus_targets` is our way of adopting [prometheus scrape type `file_sd`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#<file_sd_config>). It defines a map of files with their content. A top-level keys are base names of files which need to have their own scrape job in `prometheus_scrape_configs` and values are a content of those files.\n\nAll this mean that you CAN use custom `prometheus_scrape_configs` with `prometheus_targets` set to `{}`. However when you set anything in `prometheus_targets` it needs to be mapped to `prometheus_scrape_configs`. If it isn\'t you\'ll get an error in preflight checks.\n\n#### Example\n\nLets look at our default configuration, which shows all features. By default we have this `prometheus_targets`:\n```\nprometheus_targets:\n  node:  # This is a base file name. File is located in "{{ prometheus_config_dir }}/file_sd/<<BASENAME>>.yml"\n    - targets:              #\n        - localhost:9100    # All this is a targets section in file_sd format\n      labels:               #\n        env: test           #\n```\nSuch config will result in creating one file named `node.yml` in `{{ prometheus_config_dir }}/file_sd` directory.\n\nNext this file needs to be loaded into scrape config. Here is modified version of our default `prometheus_scrape_configs`:\n```\nprometheus_scrape_configs:\n  - job_name: "prometheus"    # Custom scrape job, here using `static_config`\n    metrics_path: "/metrics"\n    static_configs:\n      - targets:\n          - "localhost:9090"\n  - job_name: "example-node-file-servicediscovery"\n    file_sd_configs:\n      - files:\n          - "{{ prometheus_config_dir }}/file_sd/node.yml" # This line loads file created from `prometheus_targets`\n```\n\n## Example\n\n### Playbook\n\n```yaml\n---\n- hosts: all\n  roles:\n  - cloudalchemy.prometheus\n  vars:\n    prometheus_targets:\n      node:\n      - targets:\n        - localhost:9100\n        - demo.cloudalchemy.org:9100\n        labels:\n          env: demosite\n```\n\n### Demo site\n\nWe provide demo site for full monitoring solution based on prometheus and grafana. Repository with code and links to running instances is [available on github](https://github.com/cloudalchemy/demo-site) and site is hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com).\n\n### Defining alerting rules files\n\nAlerting rules are defined in `prometheus_alert_rules` variable. Format is almost identical to one defined in[ Prometheus 2.0 documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/template_examples/).\nDue to similarities in templating engines, every templates should be wrapped in `{% raw %}` and `{% endraw %}` statements. Example is provided in [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) file.\n\n## Local Testing\n\nThe preferred way of locally testing the role is to use Docker and [molecule](https://github.com/metacloud/molecule) (v2.x). You will have to install Docker on your system. See "Get started" for a Docker package suitable to for your system.\nWe are using tox to simplify process of testing on multiple ansible versions. To install tox execute:\n```sh\npip3 install tox\n```\nTo run tests on all ansible versions (WARNING: this can take some time)\n```sh\ntox\n```\nTo run a custom molecule command on custom environment with only default test scenario:\n```sh\ntox -e py35-ansible28 -- molecule test -s default\n```\nFor more information about molecule go to their [docs](http://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nIf you would like to run tests on remote docker host just specify `DOCKER_HOST` variable before running tox tests.\n\n## Travis CI\n\nCombining molecule and travis CI allows us to test how new PRs will behave when used with multiple ansible versions and multiple operating systems. This also allows use to create test scenarios for different role configurations. As a result we have a quite large test matrix which will take more time than local testing, so please be patient.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [contributor guideline](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under MIT License.
