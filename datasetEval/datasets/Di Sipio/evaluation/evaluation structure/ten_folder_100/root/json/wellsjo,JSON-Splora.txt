b'# JSON-Splora <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wellsjo/JSON-Splora/master/app/assets/logos/logo.png" width="40" align="left">\n\n**JSON-Splora** is a GUI for editing, visualizing, and manipulating JSON data with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or JavaScript.\n\n![Demo](http://i.imgur.com/CiXIrrg.gif)\n\n## Design\n- Built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)\n- Editor and output both use [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)\n- Input is parsed as [json5](http://json5.org/)\n- Filter with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or JavaScript\n\nThe editor is a JavaScript editor, and the input is parsed as [json5](http://json5.org/). This allows for comments as well as a relaxed JSON input format. Once the editor has valid JSON, an input window will appear below, allowing you to manipulate the object with JavaScript or [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). A panel will appear to the right with the output, and updates live as the input or filter changes.\n\n#### Input\n- URLs resolve to any JSON they return\n- Drag-and-drop or open any file\n- Plain text input\n\n#### Filters\n- First evaluated as JavaScript with `output = x${filter}`\n- If JS fails, it attempts to use [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)\n\n## Command Line\n```bash\njsplora [file]\n```\n\n## Install\nRequires at least Node version `6`.\n#### Globally (cli)\nThis will create the application as well as the alias `jsplora`.\n```bash\nnpm i -g json-splora\n```\n#### Locally\nBuilding locally creates a directory `JSON-Splora-<system>` which contains the application.\n```\nnpm install\n\n# build for darwin, linux, win32\nnpm run-script build-darwin\nnpm run-script build-linux\nnpm run-script build-win32\n```\n\n### Name Change\n**JSON-Splora** is becoming **json-splora** in npm. This is because of a bug in npm\'s backend confusing the two packages. I am forced to release 1.0.0, deprecate "JSON-Splora", and move to "json-splora". I apologize for any inconvenience.\n\n## Contributing\nContributions are welcome!
