b'#  simdjson : Parsing gigabytes of JSON per second\n[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/lemire/simdjson/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/lemire/simdjson/)\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/lemire/simdjson.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/lemire/simdjson)\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/lemire/simdjson/master.svg)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/lemire/simdjson)\n[![][license img]][license]\n[![Fuzzing Status](https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/badges/simdjson.svg)](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?sort=-opened&can=1&q=proj:simdjson)\n\n\n## A C++ library to see how fast we can parse JSON with complete validation.\n\nJSON documents are everywhere on the Internet. Servers spend a lot of time parsing these documents. We want to accelerate the parsing of JSON per se using commonly available SIMD instructions as much as possible while doing full validation (including character encoding). This library is part of the [Awesome Modern C++](https://awesomecpp.com) list.\n\n<img src="images/logo.png" width="10%">\n\n\n## Real-world usage\n\n- [Microsoft FishStore](https://github.com/microsoft/FishStore)\n- [Yandex ClickHouse](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse)\n\n## Research article (VLDB Journal)\n\nA description of the design and implementation of simdjson is in our research article:\n\n* Geoff Langdale, Daniel Lemire, [Parsing Gigabytes of JSON per Second](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08318), VLDB Journal (to appear)\n\nWe also have an informal [blog post providing some background and context](https://branchfree.org/2019/02/25/paper-parsing-gigabytes-of-json-per-second/).\n\nSome people [enjoy reading our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08318):\n\n[<img src="images/halvarflake.png" width="50%">](https://twitter.com/halvarflake/status/1118459536686362625)\n\n\n## Performance results\n\nsimdjson uses three-quarters less instructions than state-of-the-art parser RapidJSON and fifty percent less than sajson. To our knowledge, simdjson is the first fully-validating JSON parser to run at gigabytes per second on commodity processors.\n\n<img src="doc/gbps.png" width="90%">\n\nOn a Skylake processor, the parsing speeds (in GB/s) of various processors on the twitter.json file are as follows.\n\n| parser                                | GB/s |\n| ------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| simdjson                              | 2.2  |\n| RapidJSON encoding-validation         | 0.51 |\n| RapidJSON encoding-validation, insitu | 0.71 |\n| sajson (insitu, dynamic)              | 0.70 |\n| sajson (insitu, static)               | 0.97 |\n| dropbox                               | 0.14 |\n| fastjson                              | 0.26 |\n| gason                                 | 0.85 |\n| ultrajson                             | 0.42 |\n| jsmn                                  | 0.28 |\n| cJSON                                 | 0.34 |\n| JSON for Modern C++ (nlohmann/json)   | 0.10 |\n\n## Requirements\n\n- We support platforms like Linux or macOS, as well as Windows through Visual Studio 2017 or later.\n- A processor with\n  - AVX2 (i.e., Intel processors starting with the Haswell microarchitecture released 2013 and AMD processors starting with the Zen microarchitecture released 2017),\n  - or SSE 4.2 and CLMUL (i.e., Intel processors going back to Westmere released in 2010 or AMD processors starting with the Jaguar used in the PS4 and XBox One)\n  - or a 64-bit ARM processor (ARMv8-A): this covers a wide range of mobile processors, including all Apple processors currently available for sale, going as far back as the iPhone 5s (2013).\n- A recent C++ compiler (e.g., GNU GCC or LLVM CLANG or Visual Studio 2017), we assume C++17. GNU GCC 7 or better or LLVM\'s clang 6 or better.\n- Some benchmark scripts assume bash and other common utilities, but they are optional.\n\n## License\n\nThis code is made available under the Apache License 2.0.\n\nUnder Windows, we build some tools using the windows/dirent_portable.h file (which is outside our library code): it under the liberal (business-friendly) MIT license.\n\n## Code usage and example\n\nThe main API involves populating a `ParsedJson` object which hosts a fully navigable document-object-model (DOM) view of the JSON document. The DOM can be accessed using [JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) paths, for example. The main function is `json_parse` which takes a string containing the JSON document as well as a reference to pre-allocated `ParsedJson` object (which can be reused multiple time). Once you have populated the `ParsedJson` object you can navigate through the DOM with an iterator (e.g., created by `ParsedJson::Iterator pjh(pj)`, see \'Navigating the parsed document\').\n\n```C\n#include "simdjson/jsonparser.h"\nusing namespace simdjson;\n\n/...\n\nconst char * filename = ... //\n\n// use whatever means you want to get a string (UTF-8) of your JSON document\npadded_string p = get_corpus(filename);\nParsedJson pj;\npj.allocate_capacity(p.size()); // allocate memory for parsing up to p.size() bytes\nconst int res = json_parse(p, pj); // do the parsing, return 0 on success\n// parsing is done!\nif (res != 0) {\n    // You can use the "simdjson/simdjson.h" header to access the error message\n    std::cout << "Error parsing:" << simdjson::error_message(res) << std::endl;\n}\n// the ParsedJson document can be used here\n// pj can be reused with other json_parse calls.\n```\n\nIt is also possible to use a simpler API if you do not mind having the overhead\nof memory allocation with each new JSON document:\n\n```C\n#include "simdjson/jsonparser.h"\nusing namespace simdjson;\n\n/...\n\nconst char * filename = ... //\npadded_string p = get_corpus(filename);\nParsedJson pj = build_parsed_json(p); // do the parsing\nif( ! pj.is_valid() ) {\n    // something went wrong\n    std::cout << pj.get_error_message() << std::endl;\n}\n```\n\nThough the `padded_string` class is recommended for best performance, you can call `json_parse` and `build_parsed_json`, passing a standard `std::string` object.\n\n\n```C\n#include "simdjson/jsonparser.h"\nusing namespace simdjson;\n\n/...\nstd::string mystring = ... //\nParsedJson pj;\npj.allocate_capacity(mystring.size()); // allocate memory for parsing up to p.size() bytes\n// std::string may not overallocate so a copy will be needed\nconst int res = json_parse(mystring, pj); // do the parsing, return 0 on success\n// parsing is done!\nif (res != 0) {\n    // You can use the "simdjson/simdjson.h" header to access the error message\n    std::cout << "Error parsing:" << simdjson::error_message(res) << std::endl;\n}\n// pj can be reused with other json_parse calls.\n```\n\nor\n\n```C\n#include "simdjson/jsonparser.h"\nusing namespace simdjson;\n\n/...\n\nstd::string mystring = ... //\n// std::string may not overallocate so a copy will be needed\nParsedJson pj = build_parsed_json(mystring); // do the parsing\nif( ! pj.is_valid() ) {\n    // something went wrong\n    std::cout << pj.get_error_message() << std::endl;\n}\n```\n\nAs needed, the `json_parse` and `build_parsed_json` functions copy the input data to a temporary buffer readable up to SIMDJSON_PADDING bytes beyond the end of the data.\n\n## JSON streaming\n\n**API and detailed documentation found [here](doc/JsonStream.md).**\n\nHere is a simple exemple, using single header simdjson:\n```cpp\n#include "simdjson.h"\n#include "simdjson.cpp"\n\nint parse_file(const char *filename) {\n    simdjson::padded_string p = simdjson::get_corpus(filename);\n    simdjson::ParsedJson pj;\n    simdjson::JsonStream js{p};\n    int parse_res = simdjson::SUCCESS_AND_HAS_MORE;\n    \n    while (parse_res == simdjson::SUCCESS_AND_HAS_MORE) {\n            parse_res = js.json_parse(pj);\n\n            //Do something with pj...\n        }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage: easy single-header version\n\nSee the "singleheader" repository for a single header version. See the included\nfile "amalgamation_demo.cpp" for usage. This requires no specific build system: just\ncopy the files in your project in your include path. You can then include them quite simply:\n\n```C\n#include <iostream>\n#include "simdjson.h"\n#include "simdjson.cpp"\nusing namespace simdjson;\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n  const char * filename = argv[1];\n  padded_string p = get_corpus(filename);\n  ParsedJson pj = build_parsed_json(p); // do the parsing\n  if( ! pj.is_valid() ) {\n    std::cout << "not valid" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << pj.get_error_message() << std::endl;\n  } else {\n    std::cout << "valid" << std::endl;\n  }\n  return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n\n\nNote: In some settings, it might be desirable to precompile `simdjson.cpp` instead of including it.\n\n## Runtime dispatch\n\nOn Intel and AMD processors, we get best performance by using the hardware support for AVX2 instructions. However, simdjson also\nruns on older Intel and AMD processors. We require a minimum feature support of SSE 4.2 and CLMUL (2010 Intel Westmere or better).\nThe code automatically detects the feature set of your processor and switches to the right function at runtime (a technique\nsometimes called runtime dispatch).\n\n\nWe also support 64-bit ARM. We assume NEON support, and if the cryptographic extension is available, we leverage it, at compile-time.\nThere is no runtime dispatch on ARM.\n\n## Thread safety\n\nThe simdjson library is single-threaded. Thread safety is the responsability of the caller: it is unsafe to reuse a ParsedJson object between different threads.\n\nIf you are on an x64 processor, the runtime dispatching assigns the right code path the first time that parsing is attempted. The runtime dispatching is thread-safe.\n\n\n## Usage (old-school Makefile on platforms like Linux or macOS)\n\nRequirements: recent clang or gcc, and make. We recommend at least GNU GCC/G++ 7 or LLVM clang 6. A system like Linux or macOS is expected.\n\nTo test:\n\n```\nmake\nmake test\n```\n\nTo run benchmarks:\n\n```\nmake parse\n./parse jsonexamples/twitter.json\n```\n\nUnder Linux, the `parse` command gives a detailed analysis of the performance counters.\n\nTo run comparative benchmarks (with other parsers):\n\n```\nmake benchmark\n```\n\n## Usage (CMake on platforms like Linux or macOS)\n\nRequirements: We require a recent version of cmake. On macOS, the easiest way to install cmake might be to use [brew](https://brew.sh) and then type\n\n```\nbrew install cmake\n```\n\nThere is an [equivalent brew on Linux which works the same way as well](https://linuxbrew.sh).\n\nYou need a recent compiler like clang or gcc. We recommend at least GNU GCC/G++ 7 or LLVM clang 6. For example, you can install a recent compiler with brew:\n\n```\nbrew install gcc@8\n```\n\nOptional: You need to tell cmake which compiler you wish to use by setting the CC and CXX variables. Under bash, you can do so with commands such as `export CC=gcc-7` and `export CXX=g++-7`.\n\nBuilding: While in the project repository, do the following:\n\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake\nmake test\n```\n\nCMake will build a library. By default, it builds a shared library (e.g., libsimdjson.so on Linux).\n\nYou can build a static library:\n\n```\nmkdir buildstatic\ncd buildstatic\ncmake -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_STATIC=ON ..\nmake\nmake test\n```\n\nIn some cases, you may want to specify your compiler, especially if the default compiler on your system is too old. You may proceed as follows:\n\n```\nbrew install gcc@8\nmkdir build\ncd build\nexport CXX=g++-8 CC=gcc-8\ncmake ..\nmake\nmake test\n```\n\n## Usage (CMake on Windows using Visual Studio)\n\nWe assume you have a common Windows PC with at least Visual Studio 2017 and an x64 processor with AVX2 support (2013 Intel Haswell or later) or SSE 4.2 + CLMUL (2010 Westmere or later).\n\n- Grab the simdjson code from GitHub, e.g., by cloning it using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).\n- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). When you install it, make sure to ask that `cmake` be made available from the command line. Please choose a recent version of cmake.\n- Create a subdirectory within simdjson, such as `VisualStudio`.\n- Using a shell, go to this newly created directory.\n- Type `cmake -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 ..` in the shell while in the `VisualStudio` repository. (Alternatively, if you want to build a DLL, you may use the command line `cmake -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 -DSIMDJSON_BUILD_STATIC=OFF ..`.)\n- This last command (`cmake ...`) created a Visual Studio solution file in the newly created directory (e.g., `simdjson.sln`). Open this file in Visual Studio. You should now be able to build the project and run the tests. For example, in the `Solution Explorer` window (available from the `View` menu), right-click `ALL_BUILD` and select `Build`. To test the code, still in the `Solution Explorer` window, select `RUN_TESTS` and select `Build`.\n\n\n\n## Usage (Using `vcpkg` on Windows, Linux and MacOS)\n\n[vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) users on Windows, Linux and MacOS can download and install `simdjson` with one single command from their favorite shell.\n\nOn Linux and MacOS:\n\n```\n$ ./vcpkg install simdjson\n```\n\nwill build and install `simdjson` as a static library.\n\nOn Windows (64-bit):\n\n```\n.\\vcpkg.exe install simdjson:x64-windows\n```\n\nwill build and install `simdjson` as a shared library.\n\n```\n.\\vcpkg.exe install simdjson:x64-windows-static  \n```\n\nwill build and install `simdjson` as a static library.\n\nThese commands will also print out instructions on how to use the library from MSBuild or CMake-based projects.\n\nIf you find the version of `simdjson` shipped with `vcpkg` is out-of-date, feel free to report it to `vcpkg` community either by submiting an issue or by creating a PR.\n\n\n## Tools\n\n- `json2json mydoc.json` parses the document, constructs a model and then dumps back the result to standard output.\n- `json2json -d mydoc.json` parses the document, constructs a model and then dumps model (as a tape) to standard output. The tape format is described in the accompanying file `tape.md`.\n- `minify mydoc.json` minifies the JSON document, outputting the result to standard output. Minifying means to remove the unneeded white space characters.\n- `jsonpointer mydoc.json <jsonpath> <jsonpath> ... <jsonpath>` parses the document, constructs a model and then processes a series of [JSON Pointer paths](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901). The result is itself a JSON document.\n\n## Scope\n\nWe provide a fast parser, that fully validates an input according to various specifications.\nThe parser builds a useful immutable (read-only) DOM (document-object model) which can be later accessed.\n\nTo simplify the engineering, we make some assumptions.\n\n- We support UTF-8 (and thus ASCII), nothing else (no Latin, no UTF-16). We do not believe this is a genuine limitation, because we do not think there is any serious application that needs to process JSON data without an ASCII or UTF-8 encoding. If the UTF-8 contains a leading BOM, it should be omitted: the user is responsible for detecting and skipping the BOM; UTF-8 BOMs are discouraged.\n- All strings in the JSON document may have up to 4294967295 bytes in UTF-8 (4GB). To enforce this constraint, we refuse to parse a document that contains more than 4294967295 bytes (4GB). This should accommodate most JSON documents.\n- As allowed by the specification, we allow repeated keys within an object (other parsers like sajson do the same).\n- Performance is optimized for JSON documents spanning at least a tens kilobytes up to many megabytes: the performance issues with having to parse many tiny JSON documents or one truly enormous JSON document are different.\n\n_We do not aim to provide a general-purpose JSON library._ A library like RapidJSON offers much more than just parsing, it helps you generate JSON and offers various other convenient functions. We merely parse the document.\n\n## Features\n\n- The input string is unmodified. (Parsers like sajson and RapidJSON use the input string as a buffer.)\n- We parse integers and floating-point numbers as separate types which allows us to support large signed 64-bit integers in [-9223372036854775808,9223372036854775808), like a Java `long` or a C/C++ `long long` and large unsigned integers up to the value 18446744073709551615. Among the parsers that differentiate between integers and floating-point numbers, not all support 64-bit integers. (For example, sajson rejects JSON files with integers larger than or equal to 2147483648. RapidJSON will parse a file containing an overly long integer like 18446744073709551616 as a floating-point number.) When we cannot represent exactly an integer as a signed or unsigned 64-bit value, we reject the JSON document.\n- We support the full range of 64-bit floating-point numbers (binary64). The values range from ` std::numeric_limits<double>::lowest()`  to `std::numeric_limits<double>::max()`, so from -1.7976e308 all the way to 1.7975e308. Extreme values (less or equal to -1e308, greater or equal to 1e308) are rejected: we refuse to parse the input document.\n- We test for accurate float parsing with a bound on the [unit of least precision (ULP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_in_the_last_place) of one. Practically speaking, this implies 15 digits of accuracy or better.\n- We do full UTF-8 validation as part of the parsing. (Parsers like fastjson, gason and dropbox json11 do not do UTF-8 validation. The sajson parser does incomplete UTF-8 validation, accepting code point\nsequences like 0xb1 0x87.)\n- We fully validate the numbers. (Parsers like gason and ultranjson will accept `[0e+]` as valid JSON.)\n- We validate string content for unescaped characters. (Parsers like fastjson and ultrajson accept unescaped line breaks and tabs in strings.)\n- We fully validate the white-space characters outside of the strings. Parsers like RapidJSON will accept JSON documents with null characters outside of strings.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe parser works in two stages:\n\n- Stage 1. (Find marks) Identifies quickly structure elements, strings, and so forth. We validate UTF-8 encoding at that stage.\n- Stage 2. (Structure building) Involves constructing a "tree" of sort (materialized as a tape) to navigate through the data. Strings and numbers are parsed at this stage.\n\n## JSON Pointer\n\nWe can navigate the parsed JSON using JSON Pointers as per the [RFC6901 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).\n\nYou can build a tool (jsonpointer) to parse a JSON document and then issue an array of JSON Pointer queries:\n\n```\nmake jsonpointer\n ./jsonpointer jsonexamples/small/demo.json /Image/Width /Image/Height /Image/IDs/2\n ./jsonpointer jsonexamples/twitter.json /statuses/0/id /statuses/1/id /statuses/2/id /statuses/3/id /statuses/4/id /statuses/5/id\n```\n\nIn C++, given a `ParsedJson`, we can move to a node with the `move_to` method, passing a `std::string` representing the JSON Pointer query.\n\n## Navigating the parsed document\n\n\n\nFrom a `simdjson::ParsedJson` instance, you can create an iterator (of type `simdjson::ParsedJson::Iterator` which is in fact `simdjson::ParsedJson::BasicIterator<DEFAULT_MAX_DEPTH>` ) via a constructor:\n\n```\nParsedJson::Iterator pjh(pj); // pj is a ParsedJSON\n```\n\nYou then have access to the following methods on the resulting `simdjson::ParsedJson::Iterator`  instance:\n\n* `bool is_ok() const`: whether you have a valid iterator, will be false if your parent parsed ParsedJson is not a valid JSON.\n* `size_t get_depth() const`:  returns the current depth (start at 1 with 0 reserved for the fictitious root node)\n* `int8_t get_scope_type() const`: a scope is a series of nodes at the same depth, typically it is either an object (`{`) or an array (`[`). The root node has type \'r\'.\n* `bool move_forward()`:  move forward in document order\n* `uint8_t get_type() const`: retrieve the character code of what we\'re looking at: `[{"slutfn` are the possibilities\n* `int64_t get_integer() const`: get the int64_t value at this node; valid only if get_type() is "l"\n* `uint64_t get_unsigned_integer() const`: get the value as uint64; valid only if get_type() is "u"\n* `const char *get_string() const`: get the string value at this node (NULL ended); valid only if get_type()  is ", note that tabs, and line endings are escaped in the returned value, return value is valid UTF-8, it may contain NULL chars, get_string_length() determines the true string length.\n* `uint32_t get_string_length() const`: return the length of the string in bytes\n* `double get_double() const`: get the double value at this node; valid only if gettype() is "d"\n* `bool is_object_or_array() const`: self-explanatory\n* `bool is_object() const`: self-explanatory\n* `bool is_array() const`: self-explanatory\n* `bool is_string() const`: self-explanatory\n* `bool is_integer() const`: self-explanatory\n* `bool is_unsigned_integer() const`: Returns true if the current type of node is an unsigned integer. You can get its value with `get_unsigned_integer()`. Only a large value, which is out of range of a 64-bit signed integer, is represented internally as an unsigned node. On the other hand, a typical positive integer, such as 1, 42, or 1000000, is as a signed node. Be aware this function returns false for a signed node.\n* `bool is_double() const`: self-explanatory\n* `bool is_number() const`: self-explanatory\n* `bool is_true() const`: self-explanatory\n* `bool is_false() const`: self-explanatory\n* `bool is_null() const`: self-explanatory\n* `bool is_number() const`: self-explanatory\n* `bool move_to_key(const char *key)`: when at {, go one level deep, looking for a given key, if successful, we are left pointing at the value, if not, we are still pointing at the object ({)  (in case of repeated keys, this only finds the first one). We seek the key using C\'s strcmp so if your JSON strings contain NULL chars, this would trigger a false positive: if you expect that to be the case, take extra precautions. Furthermore, we do the comparison character-by-character without taking into account Unicode equivalence.\n* `bool move_to_key_insensitive(const char *key)`: as above, but case insensitive lookup \n* `bool move_to_key(const char *key, uint32_t length)`: as above except that the target can contain NULL characters\n* `void move_to_value()`: when at a key location within an object, this moves to the accompanying, value (located next to it).  This is equivalent but much faster than calling `next()`.\n* `bool move_to_index(uint32_t index)`: when at `[`, go one level deep, and advance to the given index, if successful, we are left pointing at the value,i f not, we are still pointing at the array\n* `bool move_to(const char *pointer, uint32_t length)`: Moves the iterator to the value correspoding to the json pointer. Always search from the root of the document. If successful, we are left pointing at the value, if not, we are still pointing the same value we were pointing before the call. The json pointer follows the rfc6901 standard\'s syntax: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901\n* `bool move_to(const std::string &pointer) `: same as above but with a std::string parameter\n* `bool next()`:   Withing a given scope (series of nodes at the same depth within either an array or an object), we move forward. Thus, given [true, null, {"a":1}, [1,2]], we would visit true, null, { and [. At the object ({) or at the array ([), you can issue a "down" to visit their content. valid if we\'re not at the end of a scope (returns true).\n* `bool prev()`:  Within a given scope (series of nodes at the same depth within either an\n   array or an object), we move backward.\n* `bool up()`:  moves back to either the containing array or object (type { or [) from within a contained scope.\n* `bool down()`: moves us to start of that deeper scope if it not empty. Thus, given [true, null, {"a":1}, [1,2]], if we are at the { node, we would move to the "a" node.\n* `void to_start_scope()`: move us to the start of our current scope, a scope is a series of nodes at the same level\n* `void rewind()`: repeatedly calls up until we are at the root of the document\n* `bool print(std::ostream &os, bool escape_strings = true) const`: print the node we are currently pointing at\n\n\nHere is a code sample to dump back the parsed JSON to a string:\n\n```c\n    ParsedJson::Iterator pjh(pj);\n    if (!pjh.is_ok()) {\n      std::cerr << " Could not iterate parsed result. " << std::endl;\n      return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n    compute_dump(pj);\n    //\n    // where compute_dump is :\n\nvoid compute_dump(ParsedJson::Iterator &pjh) {\n  if (pjh.is_object()) {\n    std::cout << "{";\n    if (pjh.down()) {\n      pjh.print(std::cout); // must be a string\n      std::cout << ":";\n      pjh.next();\n      compute_dump(pjh); // let us recurse\n      while (pjh.next()) {\n        std::cout << ",";\n        pjh.print(std::cout);\n        std::cout << ":";\n        pjh.next();\n        compute_dump(pjh); // let us recurse\n      }\n      pjh.up();\n    }\n    std::cout << "}";\n  } else if (pjh.is_array()) {\n    std::cout << "[";\n    if (pjh.down()) {\n      compute_dump(pjh); // let us recurse\n      while (pjh.next()) {\n        std::cout << ",";\n        compute_dump(pjh); // let us recurse\n      }\n      pjh.up();\n    }\n    std::cout << "]";\n  } else {\n    pjh.print(std::cout); // just print the lone value\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe following function will find all user.id integers:\n\n```C\nvoid simdjson_scan(std::vector<int64_t> &answer, ParsedJson::Iterator &i) {\n   while(i.move_forward()) {\n     if(i.get_scope_type() == \'{\') {\n       bool found_user = (i.get_string_length() == 4) && (memcmp(i.get_string(), "user", 4) == 0);\n       i.move_to_value();\n       if(found_user) {\n          if(i.is_object() && i.move_to_key("id",2)) {\n            if (i.is_integer()) {\n              answer.push_back(i.get_integer());\n            }\n            i.up();\n          }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n}\n```\n\n## In-depth comparisons\n\nIf you want to see how a wide range of parsers validate a given JSON file:\n\n```\nmake allparserscheckfile\n./allparserscheckfile myfile.json\n```\n\nFor performance comparisons:\n\n```\nmake parsingcompetition\n./parsingcompetition myfile.json\n```\n\nFor broader comparisons:\n\n```\nmake allparsingcompetition\n./allparsingcompetition myfile.json\n```\n\nBoth the `parsingcompetition` and `allparsingcompetition` tools take a `-t` flag which produces\na table-oriented output that can be conventiently parsed by other tools.\n\n\n## Docker\n\nOne can run tests and benchmarks using docker. It especially makes sense under Linux. A privileged access may be needed to get performance counters.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/lemire/simdjson.git\ncd simdjson\ndocker build -t simdjson .\ndocker run --privileged -t simdjson\n```\n\n## Other programming languages\n\nWe distinguish between "bindings" (which just wrap the C++ code) and a port to another programming language (which reimplements everything).\n\n\n- [ZippyJSON](https://github.com/michaeleisel/zippyjson): Swift bindings for the simdjson project.\n- [pysimdjson](https://github.com/TkTech/pysimdjson): Python bindings for the simdjson project.\n- [simdjson-rs](https://github.com/Licenser/simdjson-rs): Rust port.\n- [simdjson-rust](https://github.com/SunDoge/simdjson-rust): Rust wrapper (bindings).\n- [SimdJsonSharp](https://github.com/EgorBo/SimdJsonSharp): C# version for .NET Core (bindings and full port).\n- [simdjson_nodejs](https://github.com/luizperes/simdjson_nodejs): Node.js bindings for the simdjson project.\n- [simdjson_php](https://github.com/crazyxman/simdjson_php): PHP bindings for the simdjson project.\n- [simdjson_ruby](https://github.com/saka1/simdjson_ruby): Ruby bindings for the simdjson project.\n- [simdjson-go](https://github.com/fwessels/simdjson-go): Go port.\n\n\n## Various References\n\n- [Google double-conv](https://github.com/google/double-conversion/)\n- [How to implement atoi using SIMD?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35127060/how-to-implement-atoi-using-simd)\n- [Parsing JSON is a Minefield \xf0\x9f\x92\xa3](http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php)\n- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159\n- The Mison implementation in rust https://github.com/pikkr/pikkr\n- http://rapidjson.org/md_doc_sax.html\n- https://github.com/Geal/parser_benchmarks/tree/master/json\n- Gron: A command line tool that makes JSON greppable https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16727665\n- GoogleGson https://github.com/google/gson\n- Jackson https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson\n- https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge\n- RapidJSON. http://rapidjson.org/\n\nInspiring links:\n\n- https://auth0.com/blog/beating-json-performance-with-protobuf/\n- https://gist.github.com/shijuvar/25ad7de9505232c87034b8359543404a\n- https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2018-02-11.md\n\nValidating UTF-8 takes no more than 0.7 cycles per byte:\n\n- https://github.com/lemire/fastvalidate-utf-8 https://lemire.me/blog/2018/05/16/validating-utf-8-strings-using-as-little-as-0-7-cycles-per-byte/\n\n## Remarks on JSON parsing\n\n- The JSON spec defines what a JSON parser is:\n  > A JSON parser transforms a JSON text into another representation. A JSON parser MUST accept all texts that conform to the JSON grammar. A JSON parser MAY accept non-JSON forms or extensions. An implementation may set limits on the size of texts that it accepts. An implementation may set limits on the maximum depth of nesting. An implementation may set limits on the range and precision of numbers. An implementation may set limits on the length and character contents of strings.\n\n* JSON is not JavaScript:\n\n  > All JSON is Javascript but NOT all Javascript is JSON. So {property:1} is invalid because property does not have double quotes around it. {\'property\':1} is also invalid, because it\'s single quoted while the only thing that can placate the JSON specification is double quoting. JSON is even fussy enough that {"property":.1} is invalid too, because you should have of course written {"property":0.1}. Also, don\'t even think about having comments or semicolons, you guessed it: they\'re invalid.

Not enclosed in quotes, AND\n2. Is a non-whitespace character, AND\n3. Its preceding character is either:\n   (a) a structural character, OR\n   (b) whitespace.\n\nThis helps as we redefine some new characters as pseudo-structural such as the characters 1, G, n in the following:\n\n> { "foo" : 1.5, "bar" : 1.5 GEOFF_IS_A_DUMMY bla bla , "baz", null }\n\n## Academic References\n\n- T.M\xc3\xbchlbauer, W.R\xc3\xb6diger, R.Seilbeck, A.Reiser, A.Kemper, and T.Neumann.
