b'# Core Libraries\n\nEvery Elm project needs this package!\n\nIt provides **basic functionality** like addition and subtraction as well as **data structures** like lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n\n> **New to Elm?** Go to [elm-lang.org](https://elm-lang.org) for an overview.\n\n\n## Default Imports\n\nThe modules in this package are so common, that some of them are imported by default in all Elm files. So it is as if every Elm file starts with these imports:\n\n```elm\nimport Basics exposing (..)\nimport List exposing (List, (::))\nimport Maybe exposing (Maybe(..))\nimport Result exposing (Result(..))\nimport String exposing (String)\nimport Char exposing (Char)\nimport Tuple\n\nimport Debug\n\nimport Platform exposing ( Program )\nimport Platform.Cmd as Cmd exposing ( Cmd )\nimport Platform.Sub as Sub exposing ( Sub )\n```\n\nThe intention is to include things that are both extremely useful and very unlikely to overlap with anything that anyone will ever write in a library. By keeping the set of default imports relatively small, it also becomes easier to use whatever version of `map` suits your fancy. Finally, it makes it easier to figure out where the heck a function is coming from.\n'
