Our class had these design goals:\n\n- **Intuitive syntax**. In languages such as Python, JSON feels like a first class data type. We used all the operator magic of modern C++ to achieve the same feeling in your code. Check out the [examples below](#examples) and you\'ll know what I mean.\n\n- **Trivial integration**. Our whole code consists of a single header file [`json.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp). That\'s it. No library, no subproject, no dependencies, no complex build system. The class is written in vanilla C++11. All in all, everything should require no adjustment of your compiler flags or project settings.\n\n- **Serious testing**. Our class is heavily [unit-tested](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/test/src) and covers [100%](https://coveralls.io/r/nlohmann/json) of the code, including all exceptional behavior. Furthermore, we checked with [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org) and the [Clang Sanitizers](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/index.html) that there are no memory leaks. [Google OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/json) additionally runs fuzz tests against all parsers 24/7, effectively executing billions of tests so far. To maintain high quality, the project is following the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) best practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/289).\n\nOther aspects were not so important to us:\n\n- **Memory efficiency**. Each JSON object has an overhead of one pointer (the maximal size of a union) and one enumeration element (1 byte). The default generalization uses the following C++ data types: `std::string` for strings, `int64_t`, `uint64_t` or `double` for numbers, `std::map` for objects, `std::vector` for arrays, and `bool` for Booleans. However, you can template the generalized class `basic_json` to your needs.\n\n- **Speed**. There are certainly [faster JSON libraries](https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark#parsing-time) out there. However, if your goal is to speed up your development by adding JSON support with a single header, then this library is the way to go. If you know how to use a `std::vector` or `std::map`, you are already set.\n\nSee the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#please-dont) for more information.\n\n\n## Integration\n\n[`json.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp) is the single required file in `single_include/nlohmann` or [released here](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases). You need to add\n\n```cpp\n#include <nlohmann/json.hpp>\n\n// for convenience\nusing json = nlohmann::json;\n```\n\nto the files you want to process JSON and set the necessary switches to enable C++11 (e.g., `-std=c++11` for GCC and Clang).\n\nYou can further use file [`include/nlohmann/json_fwd.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/include/nlohmann/json_fwd.hpp) for forward-declarations. The installation of json_fwd.hpp (as part of cmake\'s install step), can be achieved by setting `-DJSON_MultipleHeaders=ON`.\n\n### CMake\n\nYou can also use the `nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json` interface target in CMake.  This target populates the appropriate usage requirements for `INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` to point to the appropriate include directories and `INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES` for the necessary C++11 flags.\n\n#### External\n\nTo use this library from a CMake project, you can locate it directly with `find_package()` and use the namespaced imported target from the generated package configuration:\n\n```cmake\n# CMakeLists.txt\nfind_package(nlohmann_json 3.2.0 REQUIRED)\n...\nadd_library(foo ...)\n...\ntarget_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json)\n```\n\nThe package configuration file, `nlohmann_jsonConfig.cmake`, can be used either from an install tree or directly out of the build tree.\n\n#### Embedded\n\nTo embed the library directly into an existing CMake project, place the entire source tree in a subdirectory and call `add_subdirectory()` in your `CMakeLists.txt` file:\n\n```cmake\n# Typically you don\'t care so much for a third party library\'s tests to be\n# run from your own project\'s code.\nset(JSON_BuildTests OFF CACHE INTERNAL "")\n\n# If you only include this third party in PRIVATE source files, you do not\n# need to install it when your main project gets installed.\n# set(JSON_Install OFF CACHE INTERNAL "")\n\n# Don\'t use include(nlohmann_json/CMakeLists.txt) since that carries with it\n# unintended consequences that will break the build.  It\'s generally\n# discouraged (although not necessarily well documented as such) to use\n# include(...) for pulling in other CMake projects anyways.\nadd_subdirectory(nlohmann_json)\n...\nadd_library(foo ...)\n...\ntarget_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json)\n```\n\n#### Supporting Both\n\nTo allow your project to support either an externally supplied or an embedded JSON library, you can use a pattern akin to the following:\n\n``` cmake\n# Top level CMakeLists.txt\nproject(FOO)\n...\noption(FOO_USE_EXTERNAL_JSON "Use an external JSON library" OFF)\n...\nadd_subdirectory(thirdparty)\n...\nadd_library(foo ...)\n...\n# Note that the namespaced target will always be available regardless of the\n# import method\ntarget_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json)\n```\n```cmake\n# thirdparty/CMakeLists.txt\n...\nif(FOO_USE_EXTERNAL_JSON)\n  find_package(nlohmann_json 3.2.0 REQUIRED)\nelse()\n  set(JSON_BuildTests OFF CACHE INTERNAL "")\n  add_subdirectory(nlohmann_json)\nendif()\n...\n```\n\n`thirdparty/nlohmann_json` is then a complete copy of this source tree.\n\n### Package Managers\n\n:beer: If you are using OS X and [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), just type `brew tap nlohmann/json` and `brew install nlohmann-json` and you\'re set. If you want the bleeding edge rather than the latest release, use `brew install nlohmann-json --HEAD`.\n\nIf you are using the [Meson Build System](http://mesonbuild.com), add this source tree as a [meson subproject](https://mesonbuild.com/Subprojects.html#using-a-subproject). You may also use the `include.zip` published in this project\'s [Releases](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases) to reduce the size of the vendored source tree. Alternatively, you can get a wrap file by downloading it from [Meson WrapDB](https://wrapdb.mesonbuild.com/nlohmann_json), or simply use `meson wrap install nlohmann_json`. Please see the meson project for any issues regarding the packaging.\n\nThe provided meson.build can also be used as an alternative to cmake for installing `nlohmann_json` system-wide in which case a pkg-config file is installed. To use it, simply have your build system require the `nlohmann_json` pkg-config dependency. In Meson, it is preferred to use the [`dependency()`](https://mesonbuild.com/Reference-manual.html#dependency) object with a subproject fallback, rather than using the subproject directly.\n\nIf you are using [Conan](https://www.conan.io/) to manage your dependencies, merely add `jsonformoderncpp/x.y.z@vthiery/stable` to your `conanfile.py`\'s requires, where `x.y.z` is the release version you want to use. Please file issues [here](https://github.com/vthiery/conan-jsonformoderncpp/issues) if you experience problems with the packages.\n\nIf you are using [Spack](https://www.spack.io/) to manage your dependencies, you can use the [`nlohmann-json` package](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package_list.html#nlohmann-json). Please see the [spack project](https://github.com/spack/spack) for any issues regarding the packaging.\n\nIf you are using [hunter](https://github.com/ruslo/hunter/) on your project for external dependencies, then you can use the [nlohmann_json package](https://docs.hunter.sh/en/latest/packages/pkg/nlohmann_json.html). Please see the hunter project for any issues regarding the packaging.\n\nIf you are using [Buckaroo](https://buckaroo.pm), you can install this library\'s module with `buckaroo add github.com/buckaroo-pm/nlohmann-json`. Please file issues [here](https://github.com/buckaroo-pm/nlohmann-json). There is a demo repo [here](https://github.com/njlr/buckaroo-nholmann-json-example).\n\nIf you are using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) on your project for external dependencies, then you can use the [nlohmann-json package](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/nlohmann-json). Please see the vcpkg project for any issues regarding the packaging.\n\nIf you are using [cget](http://cget.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), you can install the latest development version with `cget install nlohmann/json`. A specific version can be installed with `cget install nlohmann/json@v3.1.0`. Also, the multiple header version can be installed by adding the `-DJSON_MultipleHeaders=ON` flag (i.e., `cget install nlohmann/json -DJSON_MultipleHeaders=ON`).\n\nIf you are using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), you can use the library by adding pod `"nlohmann_json", \'~>3.1.2\'` to your podfile (see [an example](https://bitbucket.org/benman/nlohmann_json-cocoapod/src/master/)). Please file issues [here](https://bitbucket.org/benman/nlohmann_json-cocoapod/issues?status=new&status=open).\n\nIf you are using [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org), you can use the package [nlohmann.json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nlohmann.json/). Please check [this extensive description](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/1132#issuecomment-452250255) on how to use the package. Please files issues [here](https://github.com/hnkb/nlohmann-json-nuget/issues).\n\nIf you are using [conda](https://conda.io/), you can use the package [nlohmann_json](https://github.com/conda-forge/nlohmann_json-feedstock) from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) executing `conda install -c conda-forge nlohmann_json`. Please file issues [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/nlohmann_json-feedstock/issues).\n\nIf you are using [MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/), your can use the [mingw-w64-nlohmann-json](https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-nlohmann-json) package, just type `pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-nlohmann-json` or `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-nlohmann-json` for installation. Please file issues [here](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/issues/new?title=%5Bnlohmann-json%5D) if you experience problems with the packages.\n\n## Examples\n\nBeside the examples below, you may want to check the [documentation](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/) where each function contains a separate code example (e.g., check out [`emplace()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a5338e282d1d02bed389d852dd670d98d.html#a5338e282d1d02bed389d852dd670d98d)). All [example files](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/doc/examples) can be compiled and executed on their own (e.g., file [emplace.cpp](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/doc/examples/emplace.cpp)).\n\n### JSON as first-class data type\n\nHere are some examples to give you an idea how to use the class.\n\nAssume you want to create the JSON object\n\n```json\n{\n  "pi": 3.141,\n  "happy": true,\n  "name": "Niels",\n  "nothing": null,\n  "answer": {\n    "everything": 42\n  },\n  "list": [1, 0, 2],\n  "object": {\n    "currency": "USD",\n    "value": 42.99\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this library, you could write:\n\n```cpp\n// create an empty structure (null)\njson j;\n\n// add a number that is stored as double (note the implicit conversion of j to an object)\nj["pi"] = 3.141;\n\n// add a Boolean that is stored as bool\nj["happy"] = true;\n\n// add a string that is stored as std::string\nj["name"] = "Niels";\n\n// add another null object by passing nullptr\nj["nothing"] = nullptr;\n\n// add an object inside the object\nj["answer"]["everything"] = 42;\n\n// add an array that is stored as std::vector (using an initializer list)\nj["list"] = { 1, 0, 2 };\n\n// add another object (using an initializer list of pairs)\nj["object"] = { {"currency", "USD"}, {"value", 42.99} };\n\n// instead, you could also write (which looks very similar to the JSON above)\njson j2 = {\n  {"pi", 3.141},\n  {"happy", true},\n  {"name", "Niels"},\n  {"nothing", nullptr},\n  {"answer", {\n    {"everything", 42}\n  }},\n  {"list", {1, 0, 2}},\n  {"object", {\n    {"currency", "USD"},\n    {"value", 42.99}\n  }}\n};\n```\n\nNote that in all these cases, you never need to "tell" the compiler which JSON value type you want to use. If you want to be explicit or express some edge cases, the functions [`json::array()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a9ad7ec0bc1082ed09d10900fbb20a21f.html#a9ad7ec0bc1082ed09d10900fbb20a21f) and [`json::object()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_aaf509a7c029100d292187068f61c99b8.html#aaf509a7c029100d292187068f61c99b8) will help:\n\n```cpp\n// a way to express the empty array []\njson empty_array_explicit = json::array();\n\n// ways to express the empty object {}\njson empty_object_implicit = json({});\njson empty_object_explicit = json::object();\n\n// a way to express an _array_ of key/value pairs [["currency", "USD"], ["value", 42.99]]\njson array_not_object = json::array({ {"currency", "USD"}, {"value", 42.99} });\n```\n\n### Serialization / Deserialization\n\n#### To/from strings\n\nYou can create a JSON value (deserialization) by appending `_json` to a string literal:\n\n```cpp\n// create object from string literal\njson j = "{ \\"happy\\": true, \\"pi\\": 3.141 }"_json;\n\n// or even nicer with a raw string literal\nauto j2 = R"(\n  {\n    "happy": true,\n    "pi": 3.141\n  }\n)"_json;\n```\n\nNote that without appending the `_json` suffix, the passed string literal is not parsed, but just used as JSON string value. That is, `json j = "{ \\"happy\\": true, \\"pi\\": 3.141 }"` would just store the string `"{ "happy": true, "pi": 3.141 }"` rather than parsing the actual object.\n\nThe above example can also be expressed explicitly using [`json::parse()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_afd4ef1ac8ad50a5894a9afebca69140a.html#afd4ef1ac8ad50a5894a9afebca69140a):\n\n```cpp\n// parse explicitly\nauto j3 = json::parse("{ \\"happy\\": true, \\"pi\\": 3.141 }");\n```\n\nYou can also get a string representation of a JSON value (serialize):\n\n```cpp\n// explicit conversion to string\nstd::string s = j.dump();    // {\\"happy\\":true,\\"pi\\":3.141}\n\n// serialization with pretty printing\n// pass in the amount of spaces to indent\nstd::cout << j.dump(4) << std::endl;\n// {\n//     "happy": true,\n//     "pi": 3.141\n// }\n```\n\nNote the difference between serialization and assignment:\n\n```cpp\n// store a string in a JSON value\njson j_string = "this is a string";\n\n// retrieve the string value\nauto cpp_string = j_string.get<std::string>();\n// retrieve the string value (alternative when an variable already exists)\nstd::string cpp_string2;\nj_string.get_to(cpp_string2);\n\n// retrieve the serialized value (explicit JSON serialization)\nstd::string serialized_string = j_string.dump();\n\n// output of original string\nstd::cout << cpp_string << " == " << cpp_string2 << " == " << j_string.get<std::string>() << \'\\n\';\n// output of serialized value\nstd::cout << j_string << " == " << serialized_string << std::endl;\n```\n\n[`.dump()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5.html#a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5) always returns the serialized value, and [`.get<std::string>()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_aa6602bb24022183ab989439e19345d08.html#aa6602bb24022183ab989439e19345d08) returns the originally stored string value.\n\nNote the library only supports UTF-8. When you store strings with different encodings in the library, calling [`dump()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5.html#a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5) may throw an exception unless `json::error_handler_t::replace` or `json::error_handler_t::ignore` are used as error handlers.\n\n#### To/from streams (e.g. files, string streams)\n\nYou can also use streams to serialize and deserialize:\n\n```cpp\n// deserialize from standard input\njson j;\nstd::cin >> j;\n\n// serialize to standard output\nstd::cout << j;\n\n// the setw manipulator was overloaded to set the indentation for pretty printing\nstd::cout << std::setw(4) << j << std::endl;\n```\n\nThese operators work for any subclasses of `std::istream` or `std::ostream`. Here is the same example with files:\n\n```cpp\n// read a JSON file\nstd::ifstream i("file.json");\njson j;\ni >> j;\n\n// write prettified JSON to another file\nstd::ofstream o("pretty.json");\no << std::setw(4) << j << std::endl;\n```\n\nPlease note that setting the exception bit for `failbit` is inappropriate for this use case. It will result in program termination due to the `noexcept` specifier in use.\n\n#### Read from iterator range\n\nYou can also parse JSON from an iterator range; that is, from any container accessible by iterators whose content is stored as contiguous byte sequence, for instance a `std::vector<std::uint8_t>`:\n\n```cpp\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v = {\'t\', \'r\', \'u\', \'e\'};\njson j = json::parse(v.begin(), v.end());\n```\n\nYou may leave the iterators for the range [begin, end):\n\n```cpp\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v = {\'t\', \'r\', \'u\', \'e\'};\njson j = json::parse(v);\n```\n\n#### SAX interface\n\nThe library uses a SAX-like interface with the following functions:\n\n```cpp\n// called when null is parsed\nbool null();\n\n// called when a boolean is parsed; value is passed\nbool boolean(bool val);\n\n// called when a signed or unsigned integer number is parsed; value is passed\nbool number_integer(number_integer_t val);\nbool number_unsigned(number_unsigned_t val);\n\n// called when a floating-point number is parsed; value and original string is passed\nbool number_float(number_float_t val, const string_t& s);\n\n// called when a string is parsed; value is passed and can be safely moved away\nbool string(string_t& val);\n\n// called when an object or array begins or ends, resp. The number of elements is passed (or -1 if not known)\nbool start_object(std::size_t elements);\nbool end_object();\nbool start_array(std::size_t elements);\nbool end_array();\n// called when an object key is parsed; value is passed and can be safely moved away\nbool key(string_t& val);\n\n// called when a parse error occurs; byte position, the last token, and an exception is passed\nbool parse_error(std::size_t position, const std::string& last_token, const detail::exception& ex);\n```\n\nThe return value of each function determines whether parsing should proceed.\n\nTo implement your own SAX handler, proceed as follows:\n\n1. Implement the SAX interface in a class. You can use class `nlohmann::json_sax<json>` as base class, but you can also use any class where the functions described above are implemented and public.\n2. Create an object of your SAX interface class, e.g. `my_sax`.\n3. Call `bool json::sax_parse(input, &my_sax)`; where the first parameter can be any input like a string or an input stream and the second parameter is a pointer to your SAX interface.\n\nNote the `sax_parse` function only returns a `bool` indicating the result of the last executed SAX event. It does not return a  `json` value - it is up to you to decide what to do with the SAX events. Furthermore, no exceptions are thrown in case of a parse error - it is up to you what to do with the exception object passed to your `parse_error` implementation. Internally, the SAX interface is used for the DOM parser (class `json_sax_dom_parser`) as well as the acceptor (`json_sax_acceptor`), see file [`json_sax.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/include/nlohmann/detail/input/json_sax.hpp).\n\n### STL-like access\n\nWe designed the JSON class to behave just like an STL container. In fact, it satisfies the [**ReversibleContainer**](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ReversibleContainer) requirement.\n\n```cpp\n// create an array using push_back\njson j;\nj.push_back("foo");\nj.push_back(1);\nj.push_back(true);\n\n// also use emplace_back\nj.emplace_back(1.78);\n\n// iterate the array\nfor (json::iterator it = j.begin(); it != j.end(); ++it) {\n  std::cout << *it << \'\\n\';\n}\n\n// range-based for\nfor (auto& element : j) {\n  std::cout << element << \'\\n\';\n}\n\n// getter/setter\nconst auto tmp = j[0].get<std::string>();\nj[1] = 42;\nbool foo = j.at(2);\n\n// comparison\nj == "[\\"foo\\", 1, true]"_json;  // true\n\n// other stuff\nj.size();     // 3 entries\nj.empty();    // false\nj.type();     // json::value_t::array\nj.clear();    // the array is empty again\n\n// convenience type checkers\nj.is_null();\nj.is_boolean();\nj.is_number();\nj.is_object();\nj.is_array();\nj.is_string();\n\n// create an object\njson o;\no["foo"] = 23;\no["bar"] = false;\no["baz"] = 3.141;\n\n// also use emplace\no.emplace("weather", "sunny");\n\n// special iterator member functions for objects\nfor (json::iterator it = o.begin(); it != o.end(); ++it) {\n  std::cout << it.key() << " : " << it.value() << "\\n";\n}\n\n// the same code as range for\nfor (auto& el : o.items()) {\n  std::cout << el.key() << " : " << el.value() << "\\n";\n}\n\n// even easier with structured bindings (C++17)\nfor (auto& [key, value] : o.items()) {\n  std::cout << key << " : " << value << "\\n";\n}\n\n// find an entry\nif (o.find("foo") != o.end()) {\n  // there is an entry with key "foo"\n}\n\n// or simpler using count()\nint foo_present = o.count("foo"); // 1\nint fob_present = o.count("fob"); // 0\n\n// delete an entry\no.erase("foo");\n```\n\n\n### Conversion from STL containers\n\nAny sequence container (`std::array`, `std::vector`, `std::deque`, `std::forward_list`, `std::list`) whose values can be used to construct JSON values (e.g., integers, floating point numbers, Booleans, string types, or again STL containers described in this section) can be used to create a JSON array. The same holds for similar associative containers (`std::set`, `std::multiset`, `std::unordered_set`, `std::unordered_multiset`), but in these cases the order of the elements of the array depends on how the elements are ordered in the respective STL container.\n\n```cpp\nstd::vector<int> c_vector {1, 2, 3, 4};\njson j_vec(c_vector);\n// [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nstd::deque<double> c_deque {1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 5.6};\njson j_deque(c_deque);\n// [1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 5.6]\n\nstd::list<bool> c_list {true, true, false, true};\njson j_list(c_list);\n// [true, true, false, true]\n\nstd::forward_list<int64_t> c_flist {12345678909876, 23456789098765, 34567890987654, 45678909876543};\njson j_flist(c_flist);\n// [12345678909876, 23456789098765, 34567890987654, 45678909876543]\n\nstd::array<unsigned long, 4> c_array {{1, 2, 3, 4}};\njson j_array(c_array);\n// [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nstd::set<std::string> c_set {"one", "two", "three", "four", "one"};\njson j_set(c_set); // only one entry for "one" is used\n// ["four", "one", "three", "two"]\n\nstd::unordered_set<std::string> c_uset {"one", "two", "three", "four", "one"};\njson j_uset(c_uset); // only one entry for "one" is used\n// maybe ["two", "three", "four", "one"]\n\nstd::multiset<std::string> c_mset {"one", "two", "one", "four"};\njson j_mset(c_mset); // both entries for "one" are used\n// maybe ["one", "two", "one", "four"]\n\nstd::unordered_multiset<std::string> c_umset {"one", "two", "one", "four"};\njson j_umset(c_umset); // both entries for "one" are used\n// maybe ["one", "two", "one", "four"]\n```\n\nLikewise, any associative key-value containers (`std::map`, `std::multimap`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_multimap`) whose keys can construct an `std::string` and whose values can be used to construct JSON values (see examples above) can be used to create a JSON object. Note that in case of multimaps only one key is used in the JSON object and the value depends on the internal order of the STL container.\n\n```cpp\nstd::map<std::string, int> c_map { {"one", 1}, {"two", 2}, {"three", 3} };\njson j_map(c_map);\n// {"one": 1, "three": 3, "two": 2 }\n\nstd::unordered_map<const char*, double> c_umap { {"one", 1.2}, {"two", 2.3}, {"three", 3.4} };\njson j_umap(c_umap);\n// {"one": 1.2, "two": 2.3, "three": 3.4}\n\nstd::multimap<std::string, bool> c_mmap { {"one", true}, {"two", true}, {"three", false}, {"three", true} };\njson j_mmap(c_mmap); // only one entry for key "three" is used\n// maybe {"one": true, "two": true, "three": true}\n\nstd::unordered_multimap<std::string, bool> c_ummap { {"one", true}, {"two", true}, {"three", false}, {"three", true} };\njson j_ummap(c_ummap); // only one entry for key "three" is used\n// maybe {"one": true, "two": true, "three": true}\n```\n\n### JSON Pointer and JSON Patch\n\nThe library supports **JSON Pointer** ([RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901)) as alternative means to address structured values. On top of this, **JSON Patch** ([RFC 6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)) allows to describe differences between two JSON values - effectively allowing patch and diff operations known from Unix.\n\n```cpp\n// a JSON value\njson j_original = R"({\n  "baz": ["one", "two", "three"],\n  "foo": "bar"\n})"_json;\n\n// access members with a JSON pointer (RFC 6901)\nj_original["/baz/1"_json_pointer];\n// "two"\n\n// a JSON patch (RFC 6902)\njson j_patch = R"([\n  { "op": "replace", "path": "/baz", "value": "boo" },\n  { "op": "add", "path": "/hello", "value": ["world"] },\n  { "op": "remove", "path": "/foo"}\n])"_json;\n\n// apply the patch\njson j_result = j_original.patch(j_patch);\n// {\n//    "baz": "boo",\n//    "hello": ["world"]\n// }\n\n// calculate a JSON patch from two JSON values\njson::diff(j_result, j_original);\n// [\n//   { "op":" replace", "path": "/baz", "value": ["one", "two", "three"] },\n//   { "op": "remove","path": "/hello" },\n//   { "op": "add", "path": "/foo", "value": "bar" }\n// ]\n```\n\n### JSON Merge Patch\n\nThe library supports **JSON Merge Patch** ([RFC 7386](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386)) as a patch format. Instead of using JSON Pointer (see above) to specify values to be manipulated, it describes the changes using a syntax that closely mimics the document being modified.\n\n```cpp\n// a JSON value\njson j_document = R"({\n  "a": "b",\n  "c": {\n    "d": "e",\n    "f": "g"\n  }\n})"_json;\n\n// a patch\njson j_patch = R"({\n  "a":"z",\n  "c": {\n    "f": null\n  }\n})"_json;\n\n// apply the patch\nj_document.merge_patch(j_patch);\n// {\n//  "a": "z",\n//  "c": {\n//    "d": "e"\n//  }\n// }\n```\n\n### Implicit conversions\n\nSupported types can be implicitly converted to JSON values.\n\nIt is recommended to **NOT USE** implicit conversions **FROM** a JSON value.\nYou can find more details about this recommendation [here](https://www.github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/958). \n\n```cpp\n// strings\nstd::string s1 = "Hello, world!";\njson js = s1;\nauto s2 = js.get<std::string>();\n// NOT RECOMMENDED\nstd::string s3 = js;\nstd::string s4;\ns4 = js;\n\n// Booleans\nbool b1 = true;\njson jb = b1;\nauto b2 = jb.get<bool>();\n// NOT RECOMMENDED\nbool b3 = jb;\nbool b4;\nb4 = jb;\n\n// numbers\nint i = 42;\njson jn = i;\nauto f = jn.get<double>();\n// NOT RECOMMENDED\ndouble f2 = jb;\ndouble f3;\nf3 = jb;\n\n// etc.\n```\n\nNote that `char` types are not automatically converted to JSON strings, but to integer numbers. A conversion to a string must be specified explicitly:\n\n```cpp\nchar ch = \'A\';                       // ASCII value 65\njson j_default = ch;                 // stores integer number 65\njson j_string = std::string(1, ch);  // stores string "A"\n```\n\n### Arbitrary types conversions\n\nEvery type can be serialized in JSON, not just STL containers and scalar types. Usually, you would do something along those lines:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace ns {\n    // a simple struct to model a person\n    struct person {\n        std::string name;\n        std::string address;\n        int age;\n    };\n}\n\nns::person p = {"Ned Flanders", "744 Evergreen Terrace", 60};\n\n// convert to JSON: copy each value into the JSON object\njson j;\nj["name"] = p.name;\nj["address"] = p.address;\nj["age"] = p.age;\n\n// ...\n\n// convert from JSON: copy each value from the JSON object\nns::person p {\n    j["name"].get<std::string>(),\n    j["address"].get<std::string>(),\n    j["age"].get<int>()\n};\n```\n\nIt works, but that\'s quite a lot of boilerplate... Fortunately, there\'s a better way:\n\n```cpp\n// create a person\nns::person p {"Ned Flanders", "744 Evergreen Terrace", 60};\n\n// conversion: person -> json\njson j = p;\n\nstd::cout << j << std::endl;\n// {"address":"744 Evergreen Terrace","age":60,"name":"Ned Flanders"}\n\n// conversion: json -> person\nauto p2 = j.get<ns::person>();\n\n// that\'s it\nassert(p == p2);\n```\n\n#### Basic usage\n\nTo make this work with one of your types, you only need to provide two functions:\n\n```cpp\nusing nlohmann::json;\n\nnamespace ns {\n    void to_json(json& j, const person& p) {\n        j = json{{"name", p.name}, {"address", p.address}, {"age", p.age}};\n    }\n\n    void from_json(const json& j, person& p) {\n        j.at("name").get_to(p.name);\n        j.at("address").get_to(p.address);\n        j.at("age").get_to(p.age);\n    }\n} // namespace ns\n```\n\nThat\'s all! When calling the `json` constructor with your type, your custom `to_json` method will be automatically called.\nLikewise, when calling `get<your_type>()` or `get_to(your_type&)`, the `from_json` method will be called.\n\nSome important things:\n\n* Those methods **MUST** be in your type\'s namespace (which can be the global namespace), or the library will not be able to locate them (in this example, they are in namespace `ns`, where `person` is defined).\n* Those methods **MUST** be available (e.g., proper headers must be included) everywhere you use these conversions. Look at [issue 1108](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/1108) for errors that may occur otherwise.\n* When using `get<your_type>()`, `your_type` **MUST** be [DefaultConstructible](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/DefaultConstructible). (There is a way to bypass this requirement described later.)\n* In function `from_json`, use function [`at()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a93403e803947b86f4da2d1fb3345cf2c.html#a93403e803947b86f4da2d1fb3345cf2c) to access the object values rather than `operator[]`. In case a key does not exist, `at` throws an exception that you can handle, whereas `operator[]` exhibits undefined behavior.\n* You do not need to add serializers or deserializers for STL types like `std::vector`: the library already implements these.\n\n\n#### How do I convert third-party types?\n\nThis requires a bit more advanced technique. But first, let\'s see how this conversion mechanism works:\n\nThe library uses **JSON Serializers** to convert types to json.\nThe default serializer for `nlohmann::json` is `nlohmann::adl_serializer` (ADL means [Argument-Dependent Lookup](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl)).\n\nIt is implemented like this (simplified):\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <typename T>\nstruct adl_serializer {\n    static void to_json(json& j, const T& value) {\n        // calls the "to_json" method in T\'s namespace\n    }\n\n    static void from_json(const json& j, T& value) {\n        // same thing, but with the "from_json" method\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThis serializer works fine when you have control over the type\'s namespace. However, what about `boost::optional` or `std::filesystem::path` (C++17)? Hijacking the `boost` namespace is pretty bad, and it\'s illegal to add something other than template specializations to `std`...\n\nTo solve this, you need to add a specialization of `adl_serializer` to the `nlohmann` namespace, here\'s an example:\n\n```cpp\n// partial specialization (full specialization works too)\nnamespace nlohmann {\n    template <typename T>\n    struct adl_serializer<boost::optional<T>> {\n        static void to_json(json& j, const boost::optional<T>& opt) {\n            if (opt == boost::none) {\n                j = nullptr;\n            } else {\n              j = *opt; // this will call adl_serializer<T>::to_json which will\n                        // find the free function to_json in T\'s namespace!\n            }\n        }\n\n        static void from_json(const json& j, boost::optional<T>& opt) {\n            if (j.is_null()) {\n                opt = boost::none;\n            } else {\n                opt = j.get<T>(); // same as above, but with\n                                  // adl_serializer<T>::from_json\n            }\n        }\n    };\n}\n```\n\n#### How can I use `get()` for non-default constructible/non-copyable types?\n\nThere is a way, if your type is [MoveConstructible](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/MoveConstructible). You will need to specialize the `adl_serializer` as well, but with a special `from_json` overload:\n\n```cpp\nstruct move_only_type {\n    move_only_type() = delete;\n    move_only_type(int ii): i(ii) {}\n    move_only_type(const move_only_type&) = delete;\n    move_only_type(move_only_type&&) = default;\n\n    int i;\n};\n\nnamespace nlohmann {\n    template <>\n    struct adl_serializer<move_only_type> {\n        // note: the return type is no longer \'void\', and the method only takes\n        // one argument\n        static move_only_type from_json(const json& j) {\n            return {j.get<int>()};\n        }\n\n        // Here\'s the catch! You must provide a to_json method! Otherwise you\n        // will not be able to convert move_only_type to json, since you fully\n        // specialized adl_serializer on that type\n        static void to_json(json& j, move_only_type t) {\n            j = t.i;\n        }\n    };\n}\n```\n\n#### Can I write my own serializer? (Advanced use)\n\nYes. You might want to take a look at [`unit-udt.cpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/test/src/unit-udt.cpp) in the test suite, to see a few examples.\n\nIf you write your own serializer, you\'ll need to do a few things:\n\n- use a different `basic_json` alias than `nlohmann::json` (the last template parameter of `basic_json` is the `JSONSerializer`)\n- use your `basic_json` alias (or a template parameter) in all your `to_json`/`from_json` methods\n- use `nlohmann::to_json` and `nlohmann::from_json` when you need ADL\n\nHere is an example, without simplifications, that only accepts types with a size <= 32, and uses ADL.\n\n```cpp\n// You should use void as a second template argument\n// if you don\'t need compile-time checks on T\ntemplate<typename T, typename SFINAE = typename std::enable_if<sizeof(T) <= 32>::type>\nstruct less_than_32_serializer {\n    template <typename BasicJsonType>\n    static void to_json(BasicJsonType& j, T value) {\n        // we want to use ADL, and call the correct to_json overload\n        using nlohmann::to_json; // this method is called by adl_serializer,\n                                 // this is where the magic happens\n        to_json(j, value);\n    }\n\n    template <typename BasicJsonType>\n    static void from_json(const BasicJsonType& j, T& value) {\n        // same thing here\n        using nlohmann::from_json;\n        from_json(j, value);\n    }\n};\n```\n\nBe **very** careful when reimplementing your serializer, you can stack overflow if you don\'t pay attention:\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <typename T, void>\nstruct bad_serializer\n{\n    template <typename BasicJsonType>\n    static void to_json(BasicJsonType& j, const T& value) {\n      // this calls BasicJsonType::json_serializer<T>::to_json(j, value);\n      // if BasicJsonType::json_serializer == bad_serializer ... oops!\n      j = value;\n    }\n\n    template <typename BasicJsonType>\n    static void to_json(const BasicJsonType& j, T& value) {\n      // this calls BasicJsonType::json_serializer<T>::from_json(j, value);\n      // if BasicJsonType::json_serializer == bad_serializer ... oops!\n      value = j.template get<T>(); // oops!\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Specializing enum conversion\n\nBy default, enum values are serialized to JSON as integers. In some cases this could result in undesired behavior. If an enum is modified or re-ordered after data has been serialized to JSON, the later de-serialized JSON data may be undefined or a different enum value than was originally intended.\n\nIt is possible to more precisely specify how a given enum is mapped to and from JSON as shown below:\n\n```cpp\n// example enum type declaration\nenum TaskState {\n    TS_STOPPED,\n    TS_RUNNING,\n    TS_COMPLETED,\n    TS_INVALID=-1,\n};\n\n// map TaskState values to JSON as strings\nNLOHMANN_JSON_SERIALIZE_ENUM( TaskState, {\n    {TS_INVALID, nullptr},\n    {TS_STOPPED, "stopped"},\n    {TS_RUNNING, "running"},\n    {TS_COMPLETED, "completed"},\n})\n```\n\nThe `NLOHMANN_JSON_SERIALIZE_ENUM()` macro declares a set of `to_json()` / `from_json()` functions for type `TaskState` while avoiding repetition and boilerplate serialization code.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```cpp\n// enum to JSON as string\njson j = TS_STOPPED;\nassert(j == "stopped");\n\n// json string to enum\njson j3 = "running";\nassert(j3.get<TaskState>() == TS_RUNNING);\n\n// undefined json value to enum (where the first map entry above is the default)\njson jPi = 3.14;\nassert(jPi.get<TaskState>() == TS_INVALID );\n```\n\nJust as in [Arbitrary Type Conversions](#arbitrary-types-conversions) above,\n- `NLOHMANN_JSON_SERIALIZE_ENUM()` MUST be declared in your enum type\'s namespace (which can be the global namespace), or the library will not be able to locate it and it will default to integer serialization.\n- It MUST be available (e.g., proper headers must be included) everywhere you use the conversions.\n\nOther Important points:\n- When using `get<ENUM_TYPE>()`, undefined JSON values will default to the first pair specified in your map. Select this default pair carefully.\n- If an enum or JSON value is specified more than once in your map, the first matching occurrence from the top of the map will be returned when converting to or from JSON.\n\n### Binary formats (BSON, CBOR, MessagePack, and UBJSON)\n\nThough JSON is a ubiquitous data format, it is not a very compact format suitable for data exchange, for instance over a network. Hence, the library supports\xc2\xa0[BSON](http://bsonspec.org) (Binary JSON), [CBOR](http://cbor.io) (Concise Binary Object Representation), [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org), and [UBJSON](http://ubjson.org) (Universal Binary JSON Specification) to efficiently encode JSON values to byte vectors and to decode such vectors.\n\n```cpp\n// create a JSON value\njson j = R"({"compact": true, "schema": 0})"_json;\n\n// serialize to BSON\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v_bson = json::to_bson(j);\n\n// 0x1B, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x08, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x6D, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0x00, 0x01, 0x10, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00\n\n// roundtrip\njson j_from_bson = json::from_bson(v_bson);\n\n// serialize to CBOR\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v_cbor = json::to_cbor(j);\n\n// 0xA2, 0x67, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x6D, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0xF5, 0x66, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x00\n\n// roundtrip\njson j_from_cbor = json::from_cbor(v_cbor);\n\n// serialize to MessagePack\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v_msgpack = json::to_msgpack(j);\n\n// 0x82, 0xA7, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x6D, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0xC3, 0xA6, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x00\n\n// roundtrip\njson j_from_msgpack = json::from_msgpack(v_msgpack);\n\n// serialize to UBJSON\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v_ubjson = json::to_ubjson(j);\n\n// 0x7B, 0x69, 0x07, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x6D, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0x54, 0x69, 0x06, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x69, 0x00, 0x7D\n\n// roundtrip\njson j_from_ubjson = json::from_ubjson(v_ubjson);\n```\n\n\n## Supported compilers\n\nThough it\'s 2019 already, the support for C++11 is still a bit sparse. Currently, the following compilers are known to work:\n\n- GCC 4.8 - 9.2 (and possibly later)\n- Clang 3.4 - 9.0 (and possibly later)\n- Intel C++ Compiler 17.0.2 (and possibly later)\n- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 / Build Tools 14.0.25123.0 (and possibly later)\n- Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 / Build Tools 15.5.180.51428 (and possibly later)\n- Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 / Build Tools 16.3.1+1def00d3d (and possibly later)\n\nI would be happy to learn about other compilers/versions.\n\nPlease note:\n\n- GCC 4.8 has a bug [57824](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57824)): multiline raw strings cannot be the arguments to macros. Don\'t use multiline raw strings directly in macros with this compiler.\n- Android defaults to using very old compilers and C++ libraries. To fix this, add the following to your `Application.mk`. This will switch to the LLVM C++ library, the Clang compiler, and enable C++11 and other features disabled by default.\n\n    ```\n    APP_STL := c++_shared\n    NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION := clang3.6\n    APP_CPPFLAGS += -frtti -fexceptions\n    ```\n\n    The code compiles successfully with [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html?hl=ml), Revision 9 - 11 (and possibly later) and [CrystaX\'s Android NDK](https://www.crystax.net/en/android/ndk) version 10.\n\n- For GCC running on MinGW or Android SDK, the error `\'to_string\' is not a member of \'std\'` (or similarly, for `strtod`) may occur. Note this is not an issue with the code,  but rather with the compiler itself. On Android, see above to build with a newer environment.  For MinGW, please refer to [this site](http://tehsausage.com/mingw-to-string) and [this discussion](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/136) for information on how to fix this bug. For Android NDK using `APP_STL := gnustl_static`, please refer to [this discussion](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/219).\n\n- Unsupported versions of GCC and Clang are rejected by `#error` directives. This can be switched off by defining `JSON_SKIP_UNSUPPORTED_COMPILER_CHECK`. Note that you can expect no support in this case.\n\nThe following compilers are currently used in continuous integration at [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/nlohmann/json), [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nlohmann/json), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nlohmann/json), and [Doozer](https://doozer.io):\n\n| Compiler              | Operating System             | Version String |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------|----------------|\n| GCC 4.8.5             | Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS           | g++-4.8 (Ubuntu 4.8.5-2ubuntu1~14.04.2) 4.8.5 |\n| GCC 4.8.5             | CentOS Release-7-6.1810.2.el7.centos.x86_64 | g++ (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-36) |\n| GCC 4.9.2 (armv7l)    | Raspbian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie) | g++ (Raspbian 4.9.2-10+deb8u2) 4.9.2 |\n| GCC 4.9.4             | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | g++-4.9 (Ubuntu 4.9.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.1) 4.9.4 |\n| GCC 5.3.1 (armv7l)    |\xc2\xa0Ubuntu 16.04 LTS             | g++ (Ubuntu/Linaro 5.3.1-14ubuntu2) 5.3.1 20160413 |\n| GCC 5.5.0             | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | g++-5 (Ubuntu 5.5.0-12ubuntu1~14.04) 5.5.0 20171010 |\n| GCC 6.3.0             | Debian 9 (stretch)           | g++ (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) 6.3.0 20170516 |\n| GCC 6.3.1             | Fedora release 24 (Twenty Four) | g++ (GCC) 6.3.1 20161221 (Red Hat 6.3.1-1) |\n| GCC 6.4.0             | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | g++-6 (Ubuntu 6.4.0-17ubuntu1~14.04) 6.4.0 20180424 |\n| GCC 7.3.0             | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | g++-7 (Ubuntu 7.3.0-21ubuntu1~14.04) 7.3.0 |\n| GCC 7.3.0             | Windows Server 2012 R2 (x64) | g++ (x86_64-posix-seh-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 7.3.0 |\n| GCC 8.1.0             | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | g++-8 (Ubuntu 8.1.0-5ubuntu1~14.04) 8.1.0 |\n|\xc2\xa0GCC 9.2.1             | Ubuntu 14.05.1 LTS           |\xc2\xa0g++-9 (Ubuntu 9.2.1-16ubuntu1~14.04.1) 9.2.1 20191030 |\n| Clang 3.5.0           | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | clang version 3.5.0-4ubuntu2~trusty2 (tags/RELEASE_350/final) (based on LLVM 3.5.0) |\n| Clang 3.6.2           | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | clang version 3.6.2-svn240577-1~exp1 (branches/release_36) (based on LLVM 3.6.2) |\n| Clang 3.7.1           | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | clang version 3.7.1-svn253571-1~exp1 (branches/release_37) (based on LLVM 3.7.1) |\n| Clang 3.8.0           | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | clang version 3.8.0-2ubuntu3~trusty5 (tags/RELEASE_380/final) |\n| Clang 3.9.1           | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | clang version 3.9.1-4ubuntu3~14.04.3 (tags/RELEASE_391/rc2) |\n| Clang 4.0.1           | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | clang version 4.0.1-svn305264-1~exp1 (branches/release_40) |\n| Clang 5.0.2           | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | clang version 5.0.2-svn328729-1~exp1~20180509123505.100 (branches/release_50) |\n| Clang 6.0.1           | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | clang version 6.0.1-svn334776-1~exp1~20180726133705.85 (branches/release_60) |\n| Clang 7.0.1           | Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS           | clang version 7.0.1-svn348686-1~exp1~20181213084532.54 (branches/release_70) |\n| Clang Xcode 8.3       | OSX 10.11.6                  | Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.38) |\n| Clang Xcode 9.0       | OSX 10.12.6                  | Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.37) |\n| Clang Xcode 9.1       | OSX 10.12.6                  | Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.38) |\n| Clang Xcode 9.2       | OSX 10.13.3                  | Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.1) |\n| Clang Xcode 9.3       | OSX 10.13.3                  | Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.2) |\n| Clang Xcode 10.0      | OSX 10.13.3                  | Apple LLVM version 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.2) |\n| Clang Xcode 10.1      | OSX 10.13.3                  | Apple LLVM version 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5) |\n| Clang Xcode 10.2      | OSX 10.14.4                  | Apple LLVM version 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4) |\n| Clang Xcode 11.2.1    | OSX 10.14.4                  | Apple LLVM version 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.12) |\n| Visual Studio 14 2015 | Windows Server 2012 R2 (x64) | Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 14.0.25420.1, MSVC 19.0.24215.1 |\n| Visual Studio 15 2017 | Windows Server 2012 R2 (x64) | Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 15.9.21+g9802d43bc3, MSVC 19.16.27032.1 |\n| Visual Studio 16 2019 | Windows Server 2012 R2 (x64) | Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 16.3.1+1def00d3d, MSVC 19.23.28106.4 |\n\n## License\n\n<img align="right" src="http://opensource.org/trademarks/opensource/OSI-Approved-License-100x137.png">\n\nThe class is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT):\n\nCopyright &copy;

I am not sure what they are using the library for, but I am happy that it runs on so many devices.\n\n\n## Notes\n\n### Character encoding\n\nThe library supports **Unicode input** as follows:\n\n- Only **UTF-8** encoded input is supported which is the default encoding for JSON according to [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259.html#section-8.1).\n- `std::u16string` and `std::u32string` can be parsed, assuming UTF-16 and UTF-32 encoding, respectively. These encodings are not supported when reading from files or other input containers.\n- Other encodings such as Latin-1 or ISO 8859-1 are **not** supported and will yield parse or serialization errors.\n- [Unicode noncharacters](http://www.unicode.org/faq/private_use.html#nonchar1) will not be replaced by the library.\n- Invalid surrogates (e.g., incomplete pairs such as `\\uDEAD`) will yield parse errors.\n- The strings stored in the library are UTF-8 encoded. When using the default string type (`std::string`), note that its length/size functions return the number of stored bytes rather than the number of characters or glyphs.\n- When you store strings with different encodings in the library, calling [`dump()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5.html#a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5) may throw an exception unless `json::error_handler_t::replace` or `json::error_handler_t::ignore` are used as error handlers.\n\n### Comments in JSON\n\nThis library does not support comments. It does so for three reasons:\n\n1. Comments are not part of the [JSON specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259). You may argue that `//` or `/* */` are allowed in JavaScript, but JSON is not JavaScript.\n2. This was not an oversight: Douglas Crockford [wrote on this](https://plus.google.com/118095276221607585885/posts/RK8qyGVaGSr) in May 2012:\n\n\t> I removed comments from JSON because I saw people were using them to hold parsing directives, a practice which would have destroyed interoperability.  I know that the lack of comments makes some people sad, but it shouldn\'t. \n\n\t> Suppose you are using JSON to keep configuration files, which you would like to annotate. Go ahead and insert all the comments you like. Then pipe it through JSMin before handing it to your JSON parser.\n\n3. It is dangerous for interoperability if some libraries would add comment support while others don\'t. Please check [The Harmful Consequences of the Robustness Principle](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-iab-protocol-maintenance-01) on this.\n\nThis library will not support comments in the future. If you wish to use comments, I see three options:\n\n1. Strip comments before using this library.\n2. Use a different JSON library with comment support.\n3. Use a format that natively supports comments (e.g., YAML or JSON5).\n\n### Order of object keys\n\nBy default, the library does not preserve the **insertion order of object elements**. This is standards-compliant, as the [JSON standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259.html) defines objects as "an unordered collection of zero or more name/value pairs". If you do want to preserve the insertion order, you can specialize the object type with containers like [`tsl::ordered_map`](https://github.com/Tessil/ordered-map) ([integration](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/546#issuecomment-304447518)) or [`nlohmann::fifo_map`](https://github.com/nlohmann/fifo_map) ([integration](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/485#issuecomment-333652309)).\n\n### Further notes\n\n- The code contains numerous debug **assertions** which can be switched off by defining the preprocessor macro `NDEBUG`, see the [documentation of `assert`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/assert). In particular, note [`operator[]`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a233b02b0839ef798942dd46157cc0fe6.html#a233b02b0839ef798942dd46157cc0fe6) implements **unchecked access** for const objects: If the given key is not present, the behavior is undefined (think of a dereferenced null pointer) and yields an [assertion failure](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/289) if assertions are switched on. If you are not sure whether an element in an object exists, use checked access with the [`at()` function](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a73ae333487310e3302135189ce8ff5d8.html#a73ae333487310e3302135189ce8ff5d8).\n- As the exact type of a number is not defined in the [JSON specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259.html), this library tries to choose the best fitting C++ number type automatically. As a result, the type `double` may be used to store numbers which may yield [**floating-point exceptions**](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/181) in certain rare situations if floating-point exceptions have been unmasked in the calling code. These exceptions are not caused by the library and need to be fixed in the calling code, such as by re-masking the exceptions prior to calling library functions.\n- The code can be compiled without C++ **runtime type identification** features; that is, you can use the `-fno-rtti` compiler flag.\n- **Exceptions** are used widely within the library. They can, however, be switched off with either using the compiler flag `-fno-exceptions` or by defining the symbol `JSON_NOEXCEPTION`. In this case, exceptions are replaced by `abort()` calls. You can further control this behavior by defining `JSON_THROW_USER\xc2\xb4` (overriding `throw`), `JSON_TRY_USER` (overriding `try`), and `JSON_CATCH_USER` (overriding `catch`). Note that `JSON_THROW_USER` should leave the current scope (e.g., by throwing or aborting), as continuing after it may yield undefined behavior.\n\n## Execute unit tests\n\nTo compile and run the tests, you need to execute\n\n```sh\n$ mkdir build\n$ cd build\n$ cmake ..\n$ cmake --build .\n$ ctest --output-on-failure\n```\n\nFor more information, have a look at the file [.travis.yml](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/.travis.yml).\n'
