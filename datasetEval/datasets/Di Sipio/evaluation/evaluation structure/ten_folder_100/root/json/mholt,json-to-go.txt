[Check it out!](http://mholt.github.io/json-to-go)\n\nThis is a sister tool to [curl-to-Go](https://mholt.github.io/curl-to-go), which converts curl commands to Go code.\n\nThings to note:\n\n- The script sometimes has to make some assumptions, so give the output a once-over.\n- In an array of objects, it is assumed that the first object is representative of the rest of them.\n- The output is indented, but not formatted. Use `go fmt`!\n\nContributions are welcome!
