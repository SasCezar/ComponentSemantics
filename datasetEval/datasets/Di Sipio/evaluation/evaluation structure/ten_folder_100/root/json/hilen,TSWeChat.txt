The chat background can be changed freely so that UI will look perfect.\n- Custom expression keyboard, custom tool keyboard.\n- Audio `wav` files can be automatically converted into `amr` files which facilite file transfer to Android devices. Both of the two type files have been doing cache.\n- When you tap the `TSChatVoiceCell`. It will automatically check the cache and download it by [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire). \n- When you send the image, it will be stored locally by using the caching mechanism of [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher). After successfully uploaded, it will be automatically modified to image link\'s `MD5` value file name.\n- The data are loaded from the JSON file. All the `Models` are created via [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper) which is easy to convert model objects (classes and structs) from JSON.\n\n\n\n## Preview\nRun `pod install` in the `Terminal` and then run `TSWeChat.xcworkspace` to see all the views.<br><br>\n![](images/preview1.gif)\n\n![](images/preview2.gif)\n\n![](images/preview3.gif)\n\n## Directory\n\nDirectory name|Introduction\n---|---\nClasses| To deposit different folders like `ViewController`, `View`.
