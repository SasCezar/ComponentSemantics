This directory contains an example config file and the content for the demo. It serves as an example setup for your documentation. \n\nCopy at least the `config.toml` in the root directory of your website. Overwrite the existing config file if necessary. \n\nHugo includes a development server, so you can view your changes as you go -\nvery handy. Spin it up with the following command:\n\n``` sh\nhugo server\n```\n\nNow you can go to [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) and the Material\ntheme should be visible.
