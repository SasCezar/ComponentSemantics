Feel free to contribute.\n\nThis is a new code repository for SchemaSpy tool initially created and maintained [by John Currier](http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/).\nI personally believe that work on SchemaSpy should be continued, and a lot of still existing issues should be resolved.\nLast released version of the SchemaSpy was in 2010, and I have a plan to change this.\n\nI would like to say thank you to John Currier for the invention of this database entity-relationship (ER) diagram generator.\n\nMy plan is to release new SchemaSpy version and concentrate on refactoring and improving it.\n\nIn new **SchemaSpy 6.0** version you will find:\n\n1. Absolutely new amazing look and feel generated content\n\n2. You can very easily change SchemaSpy theme because all of the logic was moved outside the Java code\n\n3. Speed of database generation improved a little\n\n4. Generation of the html pages was changed from plain concatenated text in Java code to Moustache engine\n\n5. In database comments you can use Markdown language what should improve user experience from reading your database documentation\n\n6. You can also easily create in database comments links to the tables and columns\n\nMore detail will came in next days plus I have plan to start working on all not resolved issues.\n\n## Documentation\n\nIf you need more info about how to use or install SchemaSpy please read the last documentation at Read the Docs.\n\n[Documentation](https://schemaspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n[Sample Output](http://schemaspy.org/sample/index.html)\n\n[![alt tag](http://schemaspy.org/img/example_page.png)](http://schemaspy.org/sample/index.html)\n\n## SchemaSpy v6.1.0\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/schemaspy/schemaspy/releases/tag/v6.1.0)\n\n[Download](https://github.com/schemaspy/schemaspy/releases/download/v6.1.0/schemaspy-6.1.0.jar)\n\n## Latest Build\n\nTo verify fixes and new features you can download our latest build.\n\n[schemaspy@latest](https://github.com/schemaspy/schemaspy/raw/gh-pages/schemaspy-6.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar)\n\n## Docker  \n\nWe publish snapshot and release to [hub.docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/schemaspy/schemaspy/)\n\n## FAQ\n\n### General\n\n#### Schema or Catalog name can\'t be null\nThis means that Schema or Catalog information could not be extracted from connection.  \nI this case you need to add options `-s [schemaName]` or `-cat [catalogName]`   \nIn most cases for catalog you can use `-cat %`  \nIn mysql you can use same as `-db`  \n\n### OSX\n\n#### Graphviz\nThere have been lots of issue with graphviz and OSX  \nSo install using brew `brew install graphviz --with-librsvg --with-pango`  \nIf you already have graphviz installed you need to uninstall and then install  \n```\nbrew uninstall graphviz\nbrew install graphviz --with-pango --with-librsvg\n```\nDepending on OSX version  \n*Older than High Sierra*, add `-renderer :quartz` to the commandline  \n*High Sierra or newer*, add `-renderer :cairo` to the commandline  \n\n## Bugs and Issues\n\nHave a bug or an issue with SchemaSpy?
