b'# Motivation\n\nAt [Zalando](http://zalando.de), we maintain a [public Tech\nRadar](http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/) to help our engineering teams\nalign on technology choices. Is is based on the [pioneering work\nby ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).\n\nThis repository contains the code to generate the visualization:\n[`radar.js`](/docs/radar.js) (based on [d3.js v4](https://d3js.org)).\nFeel free to use and adapt it for your own purposes.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. include `d3.js` and `radar.js`:\n\n```html\n<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>\n<script src="http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/release/radar-0.5.js"></script>\n```\n\n2. insert an empty `svg` tag:\n\n```html\n<svg id="radar"></svg>\n```\n\n3. configure the radar visualization:\n\n```js\nradar_visualization({\n  svg_id: "radar",\n  width: 1450,\n  height: 1000,\n  colors: {\n    background: "#fff",\n    grid: "#bbb",\n    inactive: "#ddd"\n  },\n  title: "My Radar",\n  quadrants: [\n    { name: "Bottom Right" },\n    { name: "Bottom Left" },\n    { name: "Top Left" },\n    { name: "Top Right" }\n  ],\n  rings: [\n    { name: "INNER",  color: "#93c47d" },\n    { name: "SECOND", color: "#b7e1cd" },\n    { name: "THIRD",  color: "#fce8b2" },\n    { name: "OUTER",  color: "#f4c7c3" }\n  ],\n  print_layout: true,\n  entries: [\n   {\n      label: "Some Entry",\n      quadrant: 3,          // 0,1,2,3 (counting clockwise, starting from bottom right)\n      ring: 2,              // 0,1,2,3 (starting from inside)\n      moved: -1             // -1 = moved out (triangle pointing down)\n                            //  0 = not moved (circle)\n                            //  1 = moved in  (triangle pointing up)\n   },\n    // ...\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nEntries are positioned automatically so that they don\'t overlap.\n\nAs a working example, you can check out `docs/index.html` &mdash; the source of our [public Tech\nRadar](http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/).\n\n## Local Development\n\n1. install dependencies with yarn (or npm):\n\n```\nyarn \n```\n\n2. start local dev server:\n\n```\nyarn start\n```\n\n3. your default browser should automatically open and show the url\n \n```\nhttp://localhost:3000/\n```\n\n## License\n\n```\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Zalando SE\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
