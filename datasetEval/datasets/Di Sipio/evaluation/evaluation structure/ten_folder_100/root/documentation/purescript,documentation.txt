b'![PureScript](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/raw/master/logo.png)\n\nWelcome to the PureScript documentation repository!\n\nPureScript is a small, strongly typed programming language that compiles to JavaScript.\nTo get a better overview of PureScript, visit [The PureScript Website](http://purescript.org).\n\nThis repository is a collaborative effort, so please feel free to make a pull request to add/edit content or create an issue to discuss it. PureScript is a big project used by people coming from a variety of backgrounds. Making documentation useful to a wide variety of people is really hard to do well, requiring readers like you to point out and add documentation you feel is missing. Thanks for helping!\n\n## Directory\n\n### Getting Started\n\n- [Getting Started](guides/Getting-Started.md): Download PureScript and build your first project\n- [Try PureScript](http://try.purescript.org): Try PureScript in your browser\n\n### Learning\n\n- The [PureScript Book](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read) is the recommended approach to learning the language, since it covers more material in greater depth. However, it covers `0.11.7` and is not updated yet for the `0.12.x` version of the compiler. Thus, one should be aware of the following materials when reading through the book:\n    - See [dwhitney\'s fork of the book\'s exercises](https://github.com/dwhitney/purescript-book) which is updated for `0.12.x`.\n    - See [Justin\'s `0.11.7` to `0.12.x` summary](https://purescript-resources.readthedocs.io/en/latest/0.11.7-to-0.12.0.html) to know how to \'translate\' the outdated book\'s code into working code.\n    - Be wary of any references to these [deprecated packages](https://github.com/purescript-deprecated) in the book.\n- [Language Reference](language/README.md)\n- [PureScript: Jordan\'s Reference](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference): An up-to-date project covering Getting Started, Build Tools, PureScript\'s syntax with examples, FP design patterns, and PureScript\'s ecosystem.\n- [A guide to the PureScript numeric hierarchy](https://a-guide-to-the-purescript-numeric-hierarchy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): An introduction to the mathematics behind the numeric hierarchy of type classes in PureScript\xe2\x80\x99s Prelude. (See also [PureScript numeric hierarchy overview](https://harry.garrood.me/numeric-hierarchy-overview/).)\n\n### Guides\n\n- [Common Operators](guides/Common-Operators.md)\n- [The Foreign Function Interface (FFI)](guides/FFI.md)\n- [FFI Tips](guides/FFI-Tips.md)\n- [Custom Type Errors](guides/Custom-Type-Errors.md)\n- [PureScript Without Node](guides/PureScript-Without-Node.md)\n- [Contrib Library Guidelines](guides/Contrib-Guidelines.md)\n- [Error Suggestions](guides/Error-Suggestions.md)\n- [psc-ide FAQ](guides/psc-ide-FAQ.md)\n- [Try PureScript Help](https://github.com/purescript/trypurescript/blob/gh-pages/README.md)\n\n\n### Tools\n\n- [Editor and tool support](ecosystem/Editor-and-tool-support.md): Editor plugins, build tools, and other development tools\n- [PureScript and NixOS](https://pr06lefs.wordpress.com/2015/01/11/get-started-with-purescript-on-nixos/): How to use PureScript with NixOS\n- [PSCi](guides/PSCi.md): An interactive development tool for PureScript\n\n### Ecosystem\n\n- [Maintained Packages](ecosystem/Maintained-Packages.md)\n- [Style Guide](guides/Style-Guide.md)\n- [Alternate Backends](https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/ecosystem/Alternate-backends.md): PureScript can compile to other languages as well!\n\n### Articles\n\n- [24 Days of PureScript 2016](https://github.com/paf31/24-days-of-purescript-2016)\n\n### Talks/Meetups\n\n- [PureScript Presentations](ecosystem/PureScript-Presentations.md)\n- [PureScript Meetups](ecosystem/PureScript-Meetups.md)\n\n### Related Languages\n\n- [Related Projects](Related-Projects.md)\n- [Differences from Haskell](language/Differences-from-Haskell.md)\n\n## Project Scope\n\nTopics currently in this repository\'s scope:\n\n- PureScript language reference documentation\n- Its compiler errors\n- Core concepts on which the language is based\n- Comparison with similar languages\n- An introduction to other sources of documentation\n\nTopics currently *not* in scope:\n\n- Using PureScript libraries (those docs belong with the corresponding libraries)\n- A PureScript language teaching course (use the [PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read) book or other resources)\n- Introduction to package managers and dependency management\n\nFeel free to make an issue to discuss amending the scope.\n\n## License\n\n<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/3.0/88x31.png" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>.\n'
