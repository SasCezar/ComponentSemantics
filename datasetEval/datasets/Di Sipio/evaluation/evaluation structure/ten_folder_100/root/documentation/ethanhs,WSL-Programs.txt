If you are looking for guidance on getting started with Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, check [the Ubuntu Repo](https://github.com/abergs/ubuntuonwindows).\n\n## About\n\nA community powered list of programs that work (and those that don\'t) on the Windows subsystem for Linux. The official Microsoft repository for filing bugs, etc., is located at [Microsoft\'s BashOnWindows repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows). This repo complements the offical one by providing a quick reference for how well programs run.\n\nPlease feel free to contribute programs you have tested to the table below. If you need help with the markdown, please review [this markdown primer from gamejolt](https://help.gamejolt.com/markdown).\n\nTo contribute, please make a Pull Request; I will merge if it looks good! If you have never made a pull request, it is fast and easy. Please check out the [Github documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\nThen add your program below!\n\nIf you need to add more details about a program, add a `+` symbol to its name and add it to the [Program_Details.md](Program_Details.md) file.\n\n## Important Note\nBecause this list is community powered, the maintainer does not hold any responsibility for the accuracy of the contents of this repository.
