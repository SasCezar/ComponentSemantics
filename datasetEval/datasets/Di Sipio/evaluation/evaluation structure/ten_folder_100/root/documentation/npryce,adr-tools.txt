b"ADR Tools\n=========\n\nA command-line tool for working with a log of [Architecture Decision Records][ADRs] (ADRs).\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/npryce/adr-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/npryce/adr-tools)\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\n[Install ADR Tools](INSTALL.md).\n\nUse the `adr` command to manage ADRs.  Try running `adr help`.\n\nADRs are stored in a subdirectory of your project as Markdown files. \nThe default directory is `doc/adr`, but you can specify the directory\nwhen you initialise the ADR log.\n\n1. Create an ADR directory in the root of your project:\n\n        adr init doc/architecture/decisions\n\n    This will create a directory named `doc/architecture/decisions' \n    containing the first ADR, which records that you are using ADRs\n    to record architectural decisions and links to \n    [Michael Nygard's article on the subject][ADRs].\n\n2. Create Architecture Decision Records\n\n        adr new Implement as Unix shell scripts\n\n    This will create a new, numbered ADR file and open it in your\n    editor of choice (as specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment\n    variable).\n\n    To create a new ADR that supercedes a previous one (ADR 9, for example),\n    use the -s option.\n\n        adr new -s 9 Use Rust for performance-critical functionality\n\n    This will create a new ADR file that is flagged as superceding\n    ADR 9, and changes the status of ADR 9 to indicate that it is\n    superceded by the new ADR.  It then opens the new ADR in your\n    editor of choice.\n    \n3. For further information, use the built in help:\n\n        adr help\n\n\nSee the [tests](tests/) for detailed examples.\n\nThe decisions for this tool are recorded as [architecture decision records in the project repository](doc/adr/). \n\n[ADRs]: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions\n"
