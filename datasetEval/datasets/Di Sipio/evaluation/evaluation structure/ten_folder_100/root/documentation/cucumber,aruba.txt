It is generated from our feature files describing the use of `aruba`.\n\n### As a user getting started with a ruby testing framework\n\n* **Cucumber**:\n\n    If you\'re new to the "Cucumber" ecosystem, it\'s worth to visit\n[the project\'s documentation site](https://cucumber.io/docs). This also includes\ninformation about how to write feature files in "Gherkin".\n\n* **RSpec**:\n\n    If you want to use "aruba" with "RSpec" and you need some information about how to use "RSpec", please visit [their website](http://rspec.info/documentation/).\n\n* **minitest**:\n\n    The documentation for "minitest" can be found [here](http://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/).\n\n### As a developer getting started with "aruba"\n\nA full documentation of the API for developers can be found on\n[RubyDoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/cucumber/aruba/master/frames).\n\n## Support\n\n### Channels\n\nFor support, please have a look at the ["support website"](https://cucumber.io/support) of "Cucumber". You have different options to reach out for help: Recommended for `aruba` are using the "Slack" channels - e.g. "aruba-devs" or "general" ([Register account](https://cucumberbdd-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)) and the "Issues" page on [GitHub](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/issues). Addressing one of the maintainers directly would be helpful.\n\n### Maintainers\n\nCurrently, this gem is mainly maintained by this group of people:\n\n* [@mvz](https://github.com/mvz)\n\n## Release Policy\n\nWe try to comply with [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\n## Supported Ruby versions\n\nFor an up-to-date list of all supported Ruby versions, please see our [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/blob/master/.travis.yml). We only test against the latest version of a version branch - most times.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n## Code branches\n\nWe use two branches for development: "master" and "still". The "master" branch\ncontains the code of the current major version. The "still" branch is used for the\nold major version. New features are only added to "master". The "still" branch is\nstill maintained, but only get fixes for major bugs. The "still" branch should be considered as experimental, as we need to find out how much work it is to maintain two branches of code.\n\n## Build Status\n\n|Version|Linux / OS X|Windows|\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| master | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cucumber/aruba.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cucumber/aruba) | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/jfo2tkqhnrqqcivl/branch/master?svg=true&passingText=master%20windows%20passing&failingText=master%20windows%20failing&pendingText==master%20windows%20pending)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cucumberbdd/aruba/branch/master)|\n| still | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cucumber/aruba.svg?branch=still)](https://travis-ci.org/cucumber/aruba) | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/jfo2tkqhnrqqcivl/branch/still?svg=true&passingText=still%20windows%20passing&failingText=still%20windows%20failing&pendingText=master%20windows%20pending)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cucumberbdd/aruba/branch/still)\n'
