With appropriate configuration it will even loop through a list of endpoints. You don't have to write a single line of code to handle network failures.\n\nReleases follow the [Semantic Versionning specification](http://semver.org/)\n\n#### modular\n\nThanks to [lerna](https://lernajs.io/), xmpp.js is highly modular, each feature is implemented as a package and can be included or excluded. (even XMPP core features)\n\nThis allows to hand-pick what you need and reduce browser bundle. Additionally packages can be dynamically imported on demand.\n\n#### modern\n\nWritten in ES2015, it provides a modern promise based API and will keep up with meaningful additions to the language.\n\n## credits\n\nxmpp.js is a rewrite of [node-xmpp](https://github.com/xmppjs/xmpp.js/tree/node-xmpp) and learned a lot from it.\n\nThanks to all xmpp.js and node-xmpp [contributors](https://github.com/xmppjs/xmpp.js/graphs/contributors).\n"
