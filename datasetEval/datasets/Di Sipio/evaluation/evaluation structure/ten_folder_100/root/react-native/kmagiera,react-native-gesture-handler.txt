Clone the repo, go to the `Example/` folder and run:\n```bash\n  yarn install\n```\n\nThen run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios` (depending on which platform you want to run the example app on).\n\nYou will need to have an Android or iOS device or emulator connected as well as `react-native-cli` package installed globally.\n\n## React native Support\n\n| version | react-native version |\n| ------- | -------------------- |\n| 1.4.0+  | 0.60.0+              |\n| 1.1.0+  | 0.57.2+              | \n| <1.1.0  | 0.50.0+              |\n\n## License\n\nGesture handler library is licensed under [The MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project is supported by amazing people from [Expo.io](https://expo.io) and [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com)\n\n[![expo](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12504344?v=3&s=100 "Expo.io")](https://expo.io)\n[![swm](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6952717?v=3&s=100 "Software Mansion")](https://swmansion.com)\n'
