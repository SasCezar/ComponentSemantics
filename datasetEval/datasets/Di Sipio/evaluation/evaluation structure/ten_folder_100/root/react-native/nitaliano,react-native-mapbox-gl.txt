We provide [building blocks](https://www.mapbox.com/products/) to add location features like maps, search, and navigation into any experience you create. Use our simple and powerful APIs & SDKs and our open source libraries for interactivity and control.\n\n## Sign up for Mapbox\n\nNot a Mapbox user yet? [Sign up for an account here](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/). Once you\xe2\x80\x99re signed in, all you need to start building is a Mapbox access token. Use this same short code with all of our interactive mapping libraries, Python and JavaScript SDKs, and directly against our REST APIs. You can create and manage your access tokens on your [Mapbox Account page](https://www.mapbox.com/account/).\n\n\n## Installation\n\xf0\x9f\x9b\x91 NB: The current release `6.1.4` is not up on NPM.
