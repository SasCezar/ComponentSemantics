b'# React Native Tools\n\n[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/vscode-webdiag-extensions/VS%20Code%20WebDiag%20extensions/_apis/build/status/vscode-react-native%20%5Bmaster%5D)](https://dev.azure.com/vscode-webdiag-extensions/VS%20Code%20WebDiag%20extensions/_build/latest?definitionId=2)\n\nThis extension provides a development environment for React Native projects.\nUsing this extension, you can debug your code and quickly run `react-native` commands from the command palette.\n\n![React Native features](images/react-features.gif)\n\n## Getting started\n\n* [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).\n* [Install the extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) in VS Code:\n  1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + X` (`Cmd + Shift + X` on macOS), wait a moment while the list of available extensions is populated\n  2. Type `react-native` and install **React Native Tools**\n  3. For more guidance view [VS Code Extension Gallery](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery)\n* If you haven\'t already, set up React Native using the steps detailed on the React Native [getting started documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)\n* Open your React Native project root folder in VS Code.\n\nPlease notice that the extension uses `.vscode/.react` directory at the project root to store intermediate files required for debugging. Although these files usually get removed after debug session ends, you may want to add this directory to your project\'s `.gitignore` file.\n\n## Debugging React Native applications\n\nTo start debugging create a new debug configuration for your ReactNative app in your `.vscode/launch.json`. Adding a new configuration can be done by opening your `launch.json` file and clicking on `Add Configuration...` button and choosing a relevant debug configuration. All available debug configurations for ReactNative can be accessed by typing in *ReactNative* and picking one from the list populated by Intellisense as shown in the image below.\n\n![Add React Native debug configuration](images/add-debug-configuration.gif)\n\nIn case if you haven\'t created the `.vscode/launch.json` file yet, you can add a whole default debug configuration set. To do that click the debug icon ![Choose React Native debugger](images/debug-view-icon.png) in the View bar, and then click the configuration (gear) icon ![Configure-gear](images/configure-gear-icon.png), then choose the React Native debug environment.\n\n![Choose React Native debugger](images/choose-debugger.png)\n\nVS Code will generate a `launch.json` in your project with some default configuration settings as shown below. You can safely close this file, choose the appropriate configuration in the Configuration dropdown, and then press F5 (or click _Green Arrow_ ![Configure-gear](images/debug-icon.png) button) to start debugging your app in VS Code.\n\n![React Native launch targets](images/debug-targets.png)\n\nOnce app is loaded and ran, [open Developer Menu](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging#accessing-the-in-app-developer-menu) inside your application and enable remote debugging by clicking on `Debug JS Remotely` button.\n\n![React Native enable remote debug](images/enable-remote-debug.png)\n\nYou can debug your app on an Android emulator, Android device or iOS simulator. This extension provides [experimental support](doc/debugging.md#debugging-on-ios-device) for iOS devices.\n\nSince version 0.60.2 [React Native supports Hermes engine for Android applications](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2019/07/17/hermes). Extension provides experimental support for debugging React Native Android applications with Hermes enabled. Please see [Debugging React Native apps with Hermes enabled](doc/debugging.md#debugging-react-native-apps-with-hermes-enabled) for more details.\n\nMore information about debugging using VS Code can be found in this [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).\n\nSee [Setting up debug environment](doc/debugging.md) for more details.\n\n## React Native debug configuration properties\n\n|Name |Description|Type|Defaults|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|`cwd`|The path to the project root folder|`string`|`${workspaceFolder}`|\n|`sourceMaps`|Whether to use JavaScript source maps to map the generated bundled code back to its original sources|`boolean`|`true`|\n|`sourceMapPathOverrides`|A set of mappings for rewriting the locations of source files from what the source map says, to their locations on disk. See [Debugging with TypeScript and Haul](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native/blob/master/doc/debugging.md#debugging-with-typescript-and-haul) for details|`object`|n/a|\n|`trace`|Logging level in debugger process.

For more details about configuring and debugging Expo applications see [Expo docs](doc/expo.md).\n\n## Developing inside a Docker Container\n\nThe extension provides support of [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) features on Linux. For more details about configuring and debugging React Native Android applications inside Docker Container see [Containerization docs](doc/containerization.md).\n\n## Build APK and Generate Bundle\n\nYou can add VSCode tasks to build an .apk file and generate iOS/Android bundles. See [here](doc/tasks.md) for more info.\n\n## Customization\n\nExtension can be customized for different use cases. Please, follow [Customization](doc/customization.md) section for more details.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information\n\n## Known Issues\n\nHere is the list of common known issues you may experience while using the extension:\n\nIssue                                | Description\n------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDebugger doesn\'t stop at breakpoints | Breakpoints require sourcemaps to be correctly configured. If you are using TypeScript, then make sure to follow the `Getting started` section for how to ensure sourcemaps are correctly set up. Also, similar issues may occur on React Native version `0.58.*` in some special cases (see [#928](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native/issues/928), [#907](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native/issues/907)), bumping dependencies versions of `react` and `react-native`  package to the more recent ones should resolve these.\n\'adb: command not found\'             | If you receive an error `adb: command not found`, you need to update your system Path to include the location of your *ADB* executable.The *ADB* executable file is located in a subdirectory along with your other Android SDK files.\nTargeting iPhone 6 doesn\'t work      | There was a known issue with React Native ([#5850](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/5850)) but it was fixed. Please upgrade your version of React Native.\nCan\'t communicate with socket pipe    | (Linux only) If you have two workspaces open that only differ in casing, the extension will fail to communicate effectively.\n"Add configuration" button doesn\'t work when trying to add debug configuration to `launch.json` | You may need to have to add in some json to `launch.json` manually. Please, see ([#985](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native/issues/985))\n\n[Known-Issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aknown-issues) provides a complete list of active and resolved issues.\n\n## Telemetry reporting\n\nVS Code React Native extension collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services.
