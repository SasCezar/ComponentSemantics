JS only with no native dependencies, inspired by both RecyclerView on Android\nand UICollectionView on iOS.\n\n`npm install --save recyclerlistview`\n\nFor latest beta:  \n`npm install --save recyclerlistview@beta`\n\n* **[Overview and features](#overview-and-features)**\n* **[Why?](#why)**\n* **[Demo](#demo)**\n* **[Props](#props)**\n* **[Typescript](#typescript)**\n* **[Guides](#guides)**\n* **[License](#license)**\n* **[Contact us](#contact-us)**\n\nNote: Documentation will be upgraded soon, for now check code comments for clarity and exploring features. This component is actively tested with React Native Web as well.\n\n\n## Overview and features\nRecyclerListView uses "cell recycling" to reuse views that are no longer visible to render items instead of creating new view objects. Creation of objects\nis very expensive and comes with a memory overhead which means as you scroll through the list the memory footprint keeps going up. Releasing invisible items off\nmemory is another technique but that leads to creation of even more objects and lot of garbage collections. Recycling is the best way to render infinite lists\nthat does not compromise performance or memory efficiency.\n\nApart from all performance benefits RecyclerListView comes with great features out of the box:\n- Cross Platform, works on Web\n- Supports staggered grid layouts\n- Instant layout switching like going from GridView to ListView and vice versa\n- End reach detections\n- Horizontal Mode\n- Viewability Events\n- Initial render offset/index support\n- Footer support\n- Reflow support on container size change with first visible item preservation\n- Scroll position preservation\n- Window scrolling support for web\n- Non deterministic rendering mode on demand (height cannot be determined before rendering)\n- (New) ItemAnimator interface added, customize to your will how RLV handles layout changes. Allows you to modify animations that move cells. You can do things like smoothly move an item to a new position when height of one of the cells has changed.\n- (New) Stable Id support, ability to associate a stable id with an item. Will enable beautiful add/remove animations and optimize re-renders when DataProvider is updated.\n- (New) Sticky recycler items that stick to either the top or bottom.\n\n## Why?\n\nRecyclerListView was built with performance in mind which means no blanks while quick scrolls or frame drops.\nRecyclerListView encourages you to have deterministic heights for items you need to render. This does not mean that you need to have all items of same height and stuff, all you need\nis a way to look at the data and compute height upfront so that RecyclerListView can compute layout in one pass rather than waiting for the draw to happen.\nYou can still do all sorts of GridViews and ListViews with different types of items which are all recycled in optimal ways. Type based recycling is very easy\nto do and comes out of the box.\n\nIn case you really need non deterministic rendering set `forceNonDeterministicRendering` prop to true on RecyclerListView. This increases layout thrashing and thus, will\nnot be as fast.\n\n\n## Demo\n\n**Production Flipkart Grocery Demo Video (or try the app):** https://youtu.be/6YqEqP3MmoU  \n**Infinite Loading/View Change (Expo):** https://snack.expo.io/@naqvitalha/rlv-demo  \n**Mixed ViewTypes:** https://snack.expo.io/B1GYad52b  \n**extendedState,stableIDs and ItemAnimator (Expo):** https://snack.expo.io/@arunreddy10/19bb8e  \n**Sample project:** https://github.com/naqvitalha/travelMate  \n**Web Sample (Using RNW):** https://codesandbox.io/s/k54j2zx977, https://jolly-engelbart-8ff0d0.netlify.com/  \n**Context Preservation Sample:** https://github.com/naqvitalha/recyclerlistview-context-preservation-demo\n\n**Other Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tnv4HMmPgMc\n\n[![Watch Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Tnv4HMmPgMc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tnv4HMmPgMc)\n\n## Props\n\n| Prop | Required | Params Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| layoutProvider | Yes | BaseLayoutProvider | Constructor function that defines the layout (height / width) of each element |\n| dataProvider | Yes | DataProvider | Constructor function the defines the data for each element |\n| contextProvider | No | ContextProvider | Used to maintain scroll position in case view gets destroyed, which often happens with back navigation |\n| rowRenderer | Yes | (type: string \\| number, data: any, index: number) => JSX.Element \\| JSX.Element[] \\| null | Method that returns react component to be rendered. You get the type, data, index and extendedState of the view in the callback | \n| initialOffset | No | number | Initial offset you want to start rendering from; This is very useful if you want to maintan scroll context across pages. | \n| renderAheadOffset | No | number | specify how many pixels in advance you want views to be rendered. Increasing this value can help reduce blanks (if any). However, keeping this as low as possible should be the intent. Higher values also increase re-render compute |\n| isHorizontal | No | boolean | If true, the list will operate horizontally rather than vertically | \n| onScroll | No | rawEvent: ScrollEvent, offsetX: number, offsetY: number) => void | On scroll callback function that executes as a user scrolls |\n| onRecreate | No | (params: OnRecreateParams) => void | callback function that gets executed when recreating the recycler view from context provider |\n| externalScrollView | No | { new (props: ScrollViewDefaultProps): BaseScrollView } | Use this to pass your on implementation of BaseScrollView |\n| onEndReached | No | () => void | Callback function executed when the end of the view is hit (minus onEndThreshold if defined) |\n| onEndReachedThreshold | No | number | Specify how many pixels in advance for the onEndReached callback |\n| onVisibleIndicesChanged | No | TOnItemStatusChanged | Provides visible index; helpful in sending impression events |\n| onVisibleIndexesChanged | No | TOnItemStatusChanged | (Deprecated in 2.0 beta) Provides visible index; helpful in sending impression events |\n| renderFooter | No | () => JSX.Element \\| JSX.Element[] \\| null | Provide this method if you want to render a footer. Helpful in showing a loader while doing incremental loads |\n| initialRenderIndex | No | number | Specify the initial item index you want rendering to start from. Preferred over initialOffset if both specified |\n| scrollThrottle | No | number |iOS only; Scroll throttle duration |\n| canChangeSize | No | boolean | Specify if size can change |\n| distanceFromWindow | No | number | Web only; Specify how far away the first list item is from window top |\n| useWindowScroll | No | boolean | Web only; Layout Elements in window instead of a scrollable div |\n| disableRecycling | No | boolean | Turns off recycling |\n| forceNonDeterministicRendering | No | boolean | Default is false; if enabled dimensions provided in layout provider will not be strictly enforced. Use this if item dimensions cannot be accurately determined |\n| extendedState | No | object | In some cases the data passed at row level may not contain all the info that the item depends upon, you can keep all other info outside and pass it down via this prop. Changing this object will cause everything to re-render. Make sure you don\'t change it often to ensure performance. Re-renders are heavy. |\n| itemAnimator | No | ItemAnimator | Enables animating RecyclerListView item cells (shift, add, remove, etc) |\n| optimizeForInsertDeleteAnimations | No | boolean | Enables you to utilize layout animations better by unmounting removed items |\n| style | No | object | To pass down style to inner ScrollView |\n| scrollViewProps | No | object | For all props that need to be proxied to inner/external scrollview. Put them in an object and they\'ll be spread and passed down. |\n\nFor full feature set have a look at prop definitions of [RecyclerListView](https://github.com/Flipkart/recyclerlistview/blob/21049cc89ad606ec9fe8ea045dc73732ff29eac9/src/core/RecyclerListView.tsx#L540-L634)\n(bottom of the file). All `ScrollView` features like `RefreshControl` also work out of the box.\n\n## Typescript\n\nTypescript works out of the box. The only execption is with the inherited Scrollview props. In order for Typescript to work with inherited Scrollview props, you must place said inherited Scrollview props within the scrollViewProps prop.\n\n```javascript\n<RecyclerListView\n  rowRenderer={this.rowRenderer}\n  dataProvider={queue}\n  layoutProvider={this.layoutProvider}\n  onScroll={this.checkRefetch}\n  renderFooter={this.renderFooter}\n  scrollViewProps={{\n    refreshControl: (\n      <RefreshControl\n        refreshing={loading}\n        onRefresh={async () => {\n          this.setState({ loading: true });\n          analytics.logEvent(\'Event_Stagg_pull_to_refresh\');\n          await refetchQueue();\n          this.setState({ loading: false });\n        }}\n      />\n    )\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n## Guides\n* **[Sample Code](https://github.com/Flipkart/recyclerlistview/tree/master/docs/guides/samplecode)**\n* **[Performance](https://github.com/Flipkart/recyclerlistview/tree/master/docs/guides/performance)**\n* **[Sticky Guide](https://github.com/Flipkart/recyclerlistview/tree/master/docs/guides/sticky)**\n* **Web Support:** Works with React Native Web out of the box. For use with ReactJS start importing from `recyclerlistview/web` e.g., `import { RecyclerListView } from "recyclerlistview/web"`. Use aliases if you want to preserve import path. Only platform specific code is part of the build so, no unnecessary code will ship with your app.\n* **Polyfills Needed:** `requestAnimationFrame`\n\n## License\n**[Apache v2.0](https://github.com/Flipkart/recyclerlistview/blob/master/LICENSE.md)**\n\n## Contact Us\nPlease open issues for any bugs that you encounter.
