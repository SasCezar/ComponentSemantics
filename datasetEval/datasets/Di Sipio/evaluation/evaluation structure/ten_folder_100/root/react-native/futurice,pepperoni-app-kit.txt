We are happy that so many of you found it useful and are looking forward to build new tools in the future.\n\nIf you are new to React Native and are looking for ways how to start, [Expo](https://expo.io/) is a great choice or head straight to the [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) as it's never been easier to get started with the official setup. \n\n## Intro\n\nWe :green_heart: building apps with React Native, because it helps us create high quality products for both major mobile platforms quickly and cost-effectively.\n\nGetting started on a new app just takes too damn long, though. Most apps need the same basic building blocks and developer infrastructure, and we are bored of reinventing the wheel time and time again.\n\nThis Starter Kit reflects the best practices of React Native development we have discovered while building real-world applications for our customers. It is opinionated about tooling, patterns and development practices. It might not be a one-size-fits-all solution for everyone, but feel free to customize it for your needs, or just take inspiration from it.\n\nReact Native Starter Kit is a part of [Pepperoni](http://getpepperoni.com), a framework for kickstarting digital product development.\n\n## tltr;\n\nSounds good and you just want to see how it works? Here is a quick start guide:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/futurice/pepperoni-app-kit.git\ncd pepperoni-app-kit\nyarn install\nreact-native run-ios\n```\n\nFor further setup instructions please see our [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.\n\n## Contents\n\n:warning: **WORK IN PROGRESS** |\n:star: **COMING SOON**\n\nNot all of the below is yet fully implemented\n\n### Application Blueprint\n\n* Always up-to-date [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) scaffolding\n* Modular and well-documented structure for application code\n* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) for safe and **Reasonaboutable**:tm: state management\n* [Redux Loop](https://github.com/raisemarketplace/redux-loop) for Elm-style controlled side effects\n* [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) for awesome navigation with 60fps transitions\n* Disk-persisted application state caching for offline support and snappy startup performance\n* Clean and testable service layer for interacting with RESTful APIs\n* :warning: Sample app to show how to wire it all together\n* :star: JSON Web Token authentication\n* :star: Multi-environment configuration (dev, staging, production) for iOS and Android\n* :star: Built-in error handling and customizable error screens\n\n### Testing Setup\n\n* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for unit testing application code and providing coverage information.\n* [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and fully mocked React Native for unit testing UI components\n* Utilities for end-to-end integration testing Redux state, including side effects and asynchronous actions\n\n### Development & Deployment Infrastructure\n\n* [Bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) configurations for Continuous Integration and beta app distribution\n* :warning: [Google Tag Manager](https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/) analytics\n* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/futurice/pepperoni-app-kit) example [configuration](https://github.com/futurice/pepperoni-app-kit/blob/master/.travis.yml) for Android, iOS and Javascript tests.\n\n\n### Roadmap\n\n* **TODO** :star: [Microsoft Code Push](http://microsoft.github.io/code-push) for instant JavaScript and images update\n* **TODO** Crash reporting\n* **TODO** Android and iOS UI Testing with Calaba.sh?\n* **TODO** Feature flags?\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo build your own app on top of the Starter Kit, fork or mirror this repository. For serious use we recommend [mirroring using these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/), since you can't make a fork of a public repository private on GitHub. To contribute to Starter Kit development or just playing around, forking is the way to go.\n\nFirst, give your application a name by running `./support/rename.sh YourAppName`.\n\nOnce you have the code downloaded, follow the **[Setup guide](docs/SETUP.md)** to get started.\n\n## Development workflow\n\nAfter you have set up the project using above instructions, you can use your favorite IDE or text editor to write code, and run the application from the command line. Turn on React Native hot module reloading in the app developer menu to update your application as you code.\n\nTo learn how to structure your application and use the Redux application architecture, read the **[Architecture guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** for more details.\n\n##### Start the application in iOS simulator\n```\n$ react-native run-ios\n```\n\n##### Start the application in Android simulator\n(If using the stock emulator, the emulator must be running)\n```\n$ react-native run-android\n```\n\n##### Run unit tests\n```\n$ npm test\n```\n\n##### Run tests every time code changes\n```\n$ npm run test:watch\n```\n\n##### Generate code coverage report\n```\n$ npm run coverage\n```\n\nRead the **[Testing guide](docs/TESTING.md)** for more information about writing tests.\n\n## Debugging\n\nFor standard debugging select *Debug JS Remotely* from the React Native Development context menu (To open the context menu, press *CMD+D* in iOS or *D+D* in Android). This will open a new Chrome tab under [http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui](http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui) and prints all actions to the console.\n\nFor advanced debugging under **macOS** we suggest using the standalone [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger), which is based on the official debugger of React Native.\nIt includes the React Inspector and Redux DevTools so you can inspect React views and get a detailed history of the Redux state.\n\nYou can install it via [brew](https://brew.sh/) and run it as a standalone app:\n```\n$ brew update && brew cask install react-native-debugger\n```\n> Note: Make sure you close all active chrome debugger tabs and then restart the debugger from the React Native Development context menu.\n\n## Deployment\n\nRead the **[Deployment guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)** to learn how to deploy the application to test devices, app stores, and how to use Code Push to push updates to your users immediately.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you find any problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/futurice/pepperoni-app-kit/issues/new) or submit a fix as a pull request.\n\nWe welcome new features, but for large changes let's discuss first to make sure the changes can be accepted and integrated smoothly.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](LICENSE)\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project was initially motivated by [Snowflake](https://github.com/bartonhammond/snowflake), a React Native boilerplate by Barton Hammond. It shares some features and design principles for Pepperoni, but it wasn't the right fit for our needs. At this time Snowflake is more mature, so if you like Pepperoni but didn't agree with something we are doing, you should check it out to see if it's a good fit for your app.\n"
