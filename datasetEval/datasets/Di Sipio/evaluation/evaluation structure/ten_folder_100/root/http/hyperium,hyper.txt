However, this mostly now\naround the instability of `Future` and `async`. The rest of the API is rather\nstable now. You can also see the\n[issues in the upcoming milestones](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/milestones).\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo get involved, take a look at [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThere are two main avenues for real-time chatting about hyper: a [Gitter room][gitter]\nand [irc.mozilla.org/hyper][irc]. They are mirrored, so choose whichever format you\nprefer.\n\n[gitter]: https://gitter.im/hyperium/hyper\n[irc]: https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.mozilla.org/#hyper\n\n## License\n\nhyper is provided under the MIT license.
