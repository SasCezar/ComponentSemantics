You can get started with your project\n  quickly, with a framework that grows with your needs.\n\n  The Mojo stack provides a consistent set of components that can be used in\n  any project. The guides cover most aspects of using the framework and the\n  components have comprehensive reference documentation. Mojolicious is a\n  real-time web framework, which allows a new class of web applications\n  using WebSockets and having long-running requests without blocking.\n\n  Join us now, and be a part of a friendly and knowledgeable community of\n  developers!\n\n## Features\n\n  * An amazing **real-time web framework**, allowing you to easily grow single\n    file prototypes into well-structured MVC web applications.\n    * Powerful out of the box with RESTful routes, plugins, commands, Perl-ish\n      templates, content negotiation, session management, form validation,\n      testing framework, static file server, CGI/[PSGI](http://plackperl.org)\n      detection, first class Unicode support and much more for you to\n      discover.\n  * A powerful **web development toolkit**, that you can use for all kinds of\n    applications, independently of the web framework.\n    * Full stack HTTP and WebSocket client/server implementation with IPv6, TLS,\n      SNI, IDNA, HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy, UNIX domain socket, Comet (long polling),\n      Promises/A+, keep-alive, connection pooling, timeout, cookie, multipart,\n      and gzip compression support.\n    * Built-in non-blocking I/O web server, supporting multiple event loops as\n      well as optional pre-forking and hot deployment, perfect for building\n      highly scalable web services.\n    * JSON and HTML/XML parser with CSS selector support.\n  * Very clean, portable and object-oriented pure-Perl API with no hidden\n    magic and no requirements besides Perl 5.26.0 (versions as old as 5.10.1\n    can be used too, but may require additional CPAN modules to be installed)\n  * Fresh code based upon years of experience developing\n    [Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org), free and open source.\n  * Hundreds of 3rd party\n    [extensions](https://metacpan.org/requires/distribution/Mojolicious) and\n    high quality spin-off projects like the\n    [Minion](https://metacpan.org/pod/Minion) job queue.\n\n## Installation\n\n  All you need is a one-liner, it takes less than a minute.\n\n    $ curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - -M https://cpan.metacpan.org -n Mojolicious\n\n  We recommend the use of a [Perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl) environment.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n  These three lines are a whole web application.\n\n```perl\nuse Mojolicious::Lite;\n\nget \'/\' => {text => \'I \xe2\x99\xa5 Mojolicious!\'};\n\napp->start;\n```\n\n  To run this example with the built-in development web server just put the\n  code into a file and start it with `morbo`.\n\n    $ morbo hello.pl\n    Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000\n\n    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/\n    I \xe2\x99\xa5 Mojolicious!\n\n## Duct tape for the HTML5 web\n\n  Use all the latest Perl and HTML features in beautiful single file\n  prototypes like this one, and\n  [grow](https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Growing#Differences)\n  them easily into well-structured **Model-View-Controller** web applications.\n\n```perl\nuse Mojolicious::Lite -signatures;\n\n# Render template "index.html.ep" from the DATA section\nget \'/\' => sub ($c) {\n  $c->render(template => \'index\');\n};\n\n# WebSocket service used by the template to extract the title from a website\nwebsocket \'/title\' => sub ($c) {\n  $c->on(message => sub ($c, $msg) {\n    my $title = $c->ua->get($msg)->result->dom->at(\'title\')->text;\n    $c->send($title);\n  });\n};\n\napp->start;\n__DATA__\n\n@@ index.html.ep\n% my $url = url_for \'title\';\n<script>\n  var ws = new WebSocket(\'<%= $url->to_abs %>\');\n  ws.onmessage = function (event) { document.body.innerHTML += event.data };\n  ws.onopen    = function (event) { ws.send(\'https://mojolicious.org\') };\n</script>\n```\n\n## Want to know more?\n\n  Take a look at our excellent [documentation](https://mojolicious.org/perldoc)!\n'
