b"# Mocky\n\n#### Mock your HTTP responses to test your REST API\n\nMocky is a simple app which allows to generate custom HTTP responses. <br />\nIt's helpful when you have to request a build-in-progress WS, when you want to mock the backend response in a singleapp,\nor when you want to test your WS client.\n\n## Is Mocky online?\n\nYes, Mocky is online, free and unlimited!\n\n**Try me now! https://www.mocky.io**\n\n*Everything is done to provide the best service quality, but I don't guarantee the sustainability or the stability of the application.*\n\n## Mocky on my own server?\n\nYou can easily install Mocky on your own server.\nYou just need... a JVM!\n\nQuick steps to install Mocky\n* Install [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).\n* Clone Mocky\n* Configure the app in `conf/application.conf`. The main setting is the `version` key. You have 3 different repositories where you can store your mocks:\n * v1: mocks are stored on gist. Nothing is needed, it's free, but limited to 200 requests / hours.\n * v2: mocks are stored in mongodb. Don't forget to fill the `mongodb.uri` key.\n * fs: mocks are stored on your filesystem (in the `data` dir. by default).\n* If you want to launch mocky in dev mode, just launch `sbt run`.\n* If you want to use mocky on a server, launch `sbt dist`, copy the generated zip to your server, unzip it and launch `./bin/mocky` (easy, ain't it?)\n\n## License\n\nDO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2, December 2004\n\nCopyright (C) 2004 Sam Hocevar <sam@hocevar.net>\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified\ncopies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long\nas the name is changed.\n\nDO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0.
