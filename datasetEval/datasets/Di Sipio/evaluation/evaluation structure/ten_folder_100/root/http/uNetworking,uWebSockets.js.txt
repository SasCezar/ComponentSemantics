There are tons of [examples](examples) but here\'s the gist of it all:\n\n```javascript\n/* Non-SSL is simply App() */\nrequire(\'uWebSockets.js\').SSLApp({\n\n  /* There are tons of SSL options */\n  key_file_name: \'misc/key.pem\',\n  cert_file_name: \'misc/cert.pem\',\n  \n}).ws(\'/*\', {\n\n  /* For brevity we skip the other events */\n  message: (ws, message, isBinary) => {\n    let ok = ws.send(message, isBinary);\n  }\n  \n}).any(\'/*\', (res, req) => {\n\n  /* Let\'s deny all Http */\n  res.end(\'Nothing to see here!\');\n  \n}).listen(9001, (listenSocket) => {\n\n  if (listenSocket) {\n    console.log(\'Listening to port 9001\');\n  }\n  \n});\n```\n\n#### Ready all thrusters.\n\nInstall with `npm install uNetworking/uWebSockets.js#v16.4.0` or any such [release](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js/releases).
