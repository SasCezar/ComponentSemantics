Http4s is\nScala\'s answer to Ruby\'s Rack, Python\'s WSGI, Haskell\'s WAI, and Java\'s\nServlets.\n\n```scala\nval http = HttpRoutes.of {\n  case GET -> Root / "hello" =>\n    Ok("Hello, better world.")\n}\n```\n\nLearn more at [http4s.org](https://http4s.org/).\n\nIf you run into any difficulties please enable partial unification in your `build.sbt`\n\n```scala\nscalacOptions ++= Seq("-Ypartial-unification")\n```\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nhttp4s is proud to be a [Typelevel](https://typelevel.org/) incubator\nproject.  We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming\nenvironment for all, and ask that the community adhere to the [Scala\nCode of Conduct](https://http4s.org/code-of-conduct/).\n\n## License\n\nThis software is licensed under the Apache 2 license, quoted below.\n\n> Copyright 2013-2019 http4s [[https://http4s.org](https://http4s.org/)]\n\n> Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
