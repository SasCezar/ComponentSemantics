b'Twisted\n=======\n\n|pypi|_\n|travis|_\n|circleci|_\n\nFor information on changes in this release, see the `NEWS <NEWS.rst>`_ file.\n\n\nWhat is this?\n-------------\n\nTwisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 2.7 and Python 3.5+.\nIt includes modules for many different purposes, including the following:\n\n- ``twisted.web``: HTTP clients and servers, HTML templating, and a WSGI server\n- ``twisted.conch``: SSHv2 and Telnet clients and servers and terminal emulators\n- ``twisted.words``: Clients and servers for IRC, XMPP, and other IM protocols\n- ``twisted.mail``: IMAPv4, POP3, SMTP clients and servers\n- ``twisted.positioning``: Tools for communicating with NMEA-compatible GPS receivers\n- ``twisted.names``: DNS client and tools for making your own DNS servers\n- ``twisted.trial``: A unit testing framework that integrates well with Twisted-based code.\n\nTwisted supports all major system event loops -- ``select`` (all platforms), ``poll`` (most POSIX platforms), ``epoll`` (Linux), ``kqueue`` (FreeBSD, macOS), IOCP (Windows), and various GUI event loops (GTK+2/3, Qt, wxWidgets).\nThird-party reactors can plug into Twisted, and provide support for additional event loops.\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nTo install the latest version of Twisted using pip::\n\n  $ pip install twisted\n\nAdditional instructions for installing this software are in `the installation instructions <INSTALL.rst>`_.\n\n\nDocumentation and Support\n-------------------------\n\nTwisted\'s documentation is available from the `Twisted Matrix website <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/>`_.\nThis documentation contains how-tos, code examples, and an API reference.\n\nHelp is also available on the `Twisted mailing list <https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python>`_.\n\nThere is also a pair of very lively IRC channels, ``#twisted`` (for general Twisted questions) and ``#twisted.web`` (for Twisted Web), on ``chat.freenode.net``.\n\n\nUnit Tests\n----------\n\nTwisted has a comprehensive test suite, which can be run by ``tox``::\n\n  $ tox -l            # to view all test environments\n  $ tox -e py27-tests # to run the tests for Python 2.7\n  $ tox -e py35-tests # to run the tests for Python 3.5\n\n\nYou can test running the test suite under the different reactors with the ``TWISTED_REACTOR`` environment variable::\n\n  $ env TWISTED_REACTOR=epoll tox -e py27-tests\n\n\nSome of these tests may fail if you:\n\n* don\'t have the dependencies required for a particular subsystem installed,\n* have a firewall blocking some ports (or things like Multicast, which Linux NAT has shown itself to do), or\n* run them as root.\n\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nAll of the code in this distribution is Copyright (c) 2001-2019 Twisted Matrix Laboratories.\n\nTwisted is made available under the MIT license.\nThe included `LICENSE <LICENSE>`_ file describes this in detail.\n\n\nWarranty\n--------\n\n  THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n  EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES\n  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
