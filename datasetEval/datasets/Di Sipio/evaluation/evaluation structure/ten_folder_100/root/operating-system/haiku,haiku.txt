b'Haiku\n=======================\n**[Homepage](https://www.haiku-os.org/)\n| [Mailing Lists](https://www.haiku-os.org/community/ml)\n| [IRC Channels](https://www.haiku-os.org/community/irc)\n| [Issue Tracker](https://dev.haiku-os.org/)\n| [API docs](https://api.haiku-os.org)**\n\nHaiku is an open-source operating system that specifically targets personal\ncomputing. Inspired by the BeOS, Haiku is fast, simple to use, easy to learn\nand yet very powerful.\n\nGoals\n------------\n * Sensible defaults with minimal configuration required.\n * Clean, clear, concise code.\n * Unified desktop environment.\n\nTrying Haiku\n---------------\nHaiku provides pre-built [nightly images](http://download.haiku-os.org/) and\n[release images](https://www.haiku-os.org/get-haiku). Haiku is compatible\nwith a large variety of hardware, but in case you don\'t want to "take the\nplunge" and install Haiku on bare metal, you can install it on a virtual\nmachine (VM) instead. If you\'ve never used a VM before, you can follow one of\nthe ["Emulating Haiku"](https://www.haiku-os.org/guides/virtualizing/) guides.\n\nCompiling Haiku\n---------------\nSee `ReadMe.Compiling`.\n\nContributing\n-------------------\nHaiku is a meritocratic open source project with a large variety of tasks. Even\nif you can\'t write code, *you can still help*! Haiku needs designers,\n(technical) writers, translators, testers... Get involved and help out!\n\n### Contributing code\nIf you\'re submitting a patch to us, please make sure you\'re following the\n[patch submitting guidelines](https://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/CodingGuidelines/SubmittingPatches).\n\nIf you\'re having trouble finding something in the source tree, you can use\none of our web-based source code browsers:\n\n * http://xref.plausible.coop/ (OpenGrok, provided by Landon Fuller)\n * http://cgit.haiku-os.org/ (cgit, provided by Haiku, Inc.)\n\n### Contributing documentation\nThe main piece of documentation that still needs work are the API docs (found\nin the tree at `docs/user`). Just find an undocumented class, write\ndocumentation for it, and [submit a patch](https://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/CodingGuidelines/SubmittingPatches).\n\n### Contributing translations\nSee [wiki:i18n](https://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/i18n).\n\n### Contributing software ports\nSee [HaikuPorts](https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports/).\n\n### Contributing to our infrastructure\nSee [Infrastructure](https://github.com/haiku/infrastructure/).\n'
