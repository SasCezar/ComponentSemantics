b'[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/JehanneOS/jehanne.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JehanneOS/jehanne)\n[![Coverity Badge](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/7364/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/jehanne)\n\n# Jehanne\n\nJehanne is a [simple][simplicity] operating system.\n\nJehanne has noble ancestors:\n\n- most of userland tools, a lot of wisdom and some kernel modules,\n  come from [9front][9front]\n- the kernel is a fork of Charles Forsyth\'s [Plan9-9k][plan9-9k]\n- most of the build system and some valuable piece of code come from [Harvey OS][harvey]\n\nStill the project is named after a humble peasant,\nthe famous French heretic [Joan of Arc][arc], because it diverges deeply\nfrom the design and conventions of its predecessors.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is the main repository, used to build the system as a whole:\n\n- [arch](./arch/) contains one folder for each\n  supported architecture, with specific C headers, libraries and executables\n  (note that by architecture we intend any kind of physical or virtual\n  machine that is able to run code, thus rc is actually an architecture)\n- [sys](./sys) is the system folder\n    * [include](./sys/include) contains portable C headers\n    * [lib](./sys/lib) contains data and scripts used by the\n      running system\n    * [man](./sys/man) contains manual pages\n    * [src](./sys/src) contains the sources of the system\n- [doc](./doc/) contains useful documentation for Jehanne\n  development\n    * [license](./doc/license/) contains detailed info\n      about Jehanne [licenses][lic]\n    * [hacking](./doc/hacking/) contains details about how\n      to build and modify Jehanne\n- [hacking](./hacking) contains the utilities used to\n  develop Jehanne\n- [qa](./qa) contains the regression tests\n- [mnt](./mnt) contains default mount targets\n- [usr](./usr) contains the users\' folders\n- [pkgs](./pkgs) will contains the installed packages\n\nThe running system also includes supplemental folders like `/lib`,\n`/cmd` and `/dev` that are bound during the boot as required.\n\n## Build\n\nTo build Jehanne and play with it, you need to have git, golang, qemu,\ngcc, binutils and bison installed.\nFor example on Debian GNU/Linux you should be able to get going with\n\n\tsudo aptitude install git golang build-essential flex bison qemu-system autoconf\n\nAfter the repository clone, you can give a look with\n\n\tgit submodule init                               # we have a lot of submodules\n\tgit submodule update --init --recursive --remote --depth 1\n\t./hacking/devshell.sh                            # start a shell with appropriate environment\n\t./hacking/continuous-build.sh                    # to build everything (will take a while)\n\t./hacking/runOver9P.sh                           # to start the system in QEMU\n\t./hacking/drawterm.sh                            # to connect Jehanne with drawterm\n\n## Hacking\n\nJehanne is a work in progress.\nForks and pull requests are welcome.\n\nIn [doc/hacking](./doc/hacking/) you will find all you\nneed to know about its principles, design and weirdness.\n\nThere\'s a lot of work to do, in every area of the system.\n\nTo coordinate our efforts, we use the github issues.\nTo discuss (and even debate) about the design and development of Jehanne\nwe use the [JehanneOS mailing list][mailinglist]: please join and present\nyourself and your attitudes.\n\n[simplicity]: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ "What is simplicity?"\n[harvey]: http://harvey-os.org "Harvey OS"\n[9front]: http://9front.org/ "THE PLAN FELL OFF"\n[plan9-9k]: https://bitbucket.org/forsyth/plan9-9k "Experimental 64-bit Plan 9 kernel"\n[nix]: https://github.com/rminnich/nix-os\n[arc]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc "Jeanne d\'Arc"\n[lic]: ./LICENSE.md "A summary of Jehanne licensing"\n[mailinglist]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jehanneos\n\n'
