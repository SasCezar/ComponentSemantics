It is meant to provide a an alternative operating system for [CCU3](https://www.homematic-ip.com/en/products/detail/smart-home-central-control-unit-ccu3.html) or [ELV Charly](https://www.elv.de/elv-smart-home-zentrale-charly-starter-set-bausatz.html) systems. It is based on the **O**pen-**C**entral-**C**ontrol-**U**nit-SDK ([OCCU](https://github.com/eq-3/occu)) provided by [eQ-3](http://eq-3.de) as part of the [HomeMatic](http://homematic.com/) home automation platform. The RaspberryMatic distribution is provided as a full operating system image that can be flashed and then used in a RaspberryPi/Tinkerboard as the main operating system for controlling all HomeMatic compatible devices with full compatibility to a CCU device directly sold by eQ-3.\n\n## :cookie: Features\n* 100% HomeMatic

For RaspberryMatic, standard CCU Addon packages won\'t work because included binaries have to be recompiled for the hard-float buildroot environment RaspberryMatic uses. Here is a list of well-known already compatible Addon packages (please note that this list might be incomplete):\n\n* [CUxD](https://github.com/jens-maus/cuxd)\n* [XML-API](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/XML-API)\n* [hm_pdetect](https://github.com/jens-maus/hm_pdetect)\n* [Email-Addon](https://github.com/jens-maus/hm_email)\n* [CUxD-Highcharts](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/CUxD-Highcharts)\n* [HQ-WebUI](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/hq-webui)\n* [DB-Access](https://github.com/jens-maus/dbaccess)\n* [QuickAccess](https://github.com/jens-maus/quickaccess)\n* [Script-Parser](https://github.com/litti/scriptparser)\n* [WebMatic](https://github.com/ldittmar81/webmatic)\n* [Sonos Player](https://github.com/jens-maus/hm-sonos)\n* [hm2mqtt](https://github.com/owagner/hm2mqtt)\n* [CCU-Historian](https://github.com/mdzio/ccu-historian)\n* [Watchdog](https://github.com/jens-maus/hm-watchdog)\n* [homeputer CL Studio](http://www.contronics.de/download/homeputer-studio-software.html)\n* [Print / ProgrammeDrucken](https://github.com/litti/hm-print)\n* [HomeMatic Check_MK](https://github.com/alexreinert/homematic_check_mk)\n* [hm-tools](https://github.com/fhetty/hm-tools)\n* [HB-UW-Sen-THPL Universalsensor](https://github.com/jp112sdl/Wettersensor/tree/master/Contrib/CCURM)\n* [RedMatic](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/RedMatic)\n* [Mosquitto](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/ccu-addon-mosquitto)\n* [Redis](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/ccu-addon-redis)\n* [HomeMatic Virtual Interface](https://github.com/thkl/Homematic-Virtual-Interface)\n* [ioBroker CCU Addon](https://github.com/zautrix/hm-iobroker)\n* [Philips Hue Addon](https://github.com/j-a-n/homematic-addon-hue)\n* [Velux Addon](https://github.com/j-a-n/homematic-addon-velux)\n* [LGTV Addon](https://github.com/j-a-n/homematic-addon-lgtv)\n\n## :cloud: Installation\nThe installation of RaspberryMatic is quite straight forward as it is delivered as a full system image that can be directly flashed onto a microSD / eMMC and put into the corresponding SBC. As such the installation consists of the following basic steps:\n\n1. [Download latest release](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/releases) archive (`RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.zip`) for the hardware platform you are using:\n   * `wget https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/releases/download/X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD/RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.zip`\n2. Unarchive zip file resulting in an SD card image (`RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.img`), e.g.:\n   * `unzip RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.zip`\n3. Check sha256 checksum to check integrity of SD card image, e.g.:\n   * `sha256sum -c RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.img.sha256`\n4. Use the  image flasher tool "Etcher" (https://etcher.io) to flash the `*.img` file to your SD card or USB drive. As an alternative you can also use the following command-line calls to manually flash it on Unix-based operating systems:\n   * <i>Linux</i>: `sudo dd if=RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M conv=fsync`\n   * <i>macOS</i>: `sudo dd if=RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.img of=/dev/rdiskX bs=1m`\n5. For RPI-RF-MOD/HM-MOD-RPI-PCB use only: Make sure you have the RPI-RF-MOD/HM-MOD-RPI-PCB radio module correctly installed on the GPIO\n6. Install microSD in your SBC and connect power\n7. Wait until bootup process is finished and use a web browser to connect to http://homematic-raspi/\n\n## :memo: Documentation\nDocumentation (e.g. how to port your HomeMatic configuration from a CCU2/CCU3 to RaspberryMatic) and installation support is currently limited to using a mostly german language speaking fora with the following links pointing to the relevant sections of the fora where you can find documentation and help about RaspberryMatic:\n\n* [RaspberryMatic - Installation Guide :de:](https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=34497#p328057)\n* [RaspberryMatic - Forum :de:](https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewforum.php?f=65)\n* [HM-MOD-RPI-PCB - Installation Video :de:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtzXsvOLa_Y)\n\n## :tv: Presentations (German :de: \xe2\x80\x93 YouTube)\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=regDw7rcIb0"><img alt="Usertreffen Kassel 2019 \xe2\x80\x93 RaspberryMatic" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/regDw7rcIb0/hqdefault.jpg" width=320></a>\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSmDcrkHb7M"><img alt="Usertreffen Kassel 2018 \xe2\x80\x93 RaspberryMatic" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/hSmDcrkHb7M/hqdefault.jpg" width=320></a>\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQrzittdEGg"><img alt="Usertreffen Kassel 2017 \xe2\x80\x93 RaspberryMatic (Teil 1)" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/LQrzittdEGg/hqdefault.jpg" width=320></a>\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSTLdVKSeM"><img alt="Usertreffen Kassel 2017 - RaspberryMatic (Teil 2)" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/duSTLdVKSeM/hqdefault.jpg" width=320></a>\n\n## :yum: How to contribute\nAs the RaspberryMatic project is an open source based project everyone is invited to contribute to this project. Please note, however, that functionality within the corresponding eQ-3 OCCU binaries can not be modified as the main HomeMatic services (rfd, ReGaHSS, HMServer, etc.) are provided in binary format by the [OCCU](https://github.com/eq-3/occu) project and not compiled from sources. Nevertheless, if you are a talented developer and want to contribute to the success of RaspberryMatic feel free to send over pull requests or report issues / enhancement requests. Please note, however, the licensing and contributing implications and accept that - in short - anything you contribute to this repository/project (especially source code) will be (re)licensed under the Apache 2.0 license (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

But if you know what you are doing and which host tools are required to actually be able to run a RaspberryMatic build, it should be as simple as:\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic\n$ cd RaspberryMatic\n$ make dist\n[wait up to 1h]\n$ make install of=/dev/sdX\n```\n\n#### :bookmark: Using the generated cross compiler\nAfter a successfull build of RaspberryMatic a dedicated cross compiler (`arm-linux-gcc`) should be available within the `build-raspmatic_rpi3` path. You can use this GCC-based cross compiler to compile all kind of third party applications which can then be run within RaspberryMatic:\n\n```sh\n$ cd HelloWorld\n$ <path-to-RaspberryMatic-build>/build-raspmatic_rpi3/host/usr/bin/arm-linux-gcc -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.c\n```\n\nA valid alternative for building RaspberryMatic ARM-hardfloat compatible binaries is to use the following Linux cross compiler suite [supplied by the RaspberryPi foundation](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/tree/master/arm-bcm2708/arm-rpi-4.9.3-linux-gnueabihf).\n\n## :scroll: License\nThe RaspberryMatic build environment itself \xe2\x80\x93 the files found in this git repository \xe2\x80\x93 as well as the RaspberryMatic sd card images are licensed under the conditions of the [Apache License 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0).
