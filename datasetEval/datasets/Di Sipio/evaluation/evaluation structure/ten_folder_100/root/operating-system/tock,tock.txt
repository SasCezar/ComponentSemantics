b'# ![TockOS](http://www.tockos.org/assets/img/tock.svg "TockOS Logo")\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tock/tock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tock/tock)\n[![slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-tockos-informational)][slack]\n\nTock is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent, mutually\ndistrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded platforms.\nTock\'s design\ncenters around protection, both from potentially malicious applications and\nfrom device drivers. Tock uses two mechanisms to protect different components\nof the operating system. First, the kernel and device drivers are written in\nRust, a systems programming language that provides compile-time memory safety,\ntype safety and strict aliasing. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel (e.g. the\nscheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific device drivers\nas well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock uses memory\nprotection units to isolate applications from each other and the kernel.\n\n\nLearn More\n----------\n\nHow would you like to get started?\n\n### Learn How Tock Works\n\nTock is documented in the [doc](doc) folder. Read through the guides there to\nlearn about the overview and design of Tock, its implementation, and much\nmore.\n\n\n### Use Tock\n\nFollow our [getting started guide](doc/Getting_Started.md) to set up your\nsystem to compile Tock.\n\nHead to the [hardware page](https://www.tockos.org/hardware/)\nto learn about the hardware platforms Tock supports. Also check out the\n[Tock Book](https://book.tockos.org) for a step-by-step introduction to getting\nTock up and running.\n\nFind example applications that run on top of the Tock kernel written in both\n[Rust](https://github.com/tock/libtock-rs) and\n[C](https://github.com/tock/libtock-c).\n\n\n### Develop Tock\n\nRead our [getting started guide](doc/Getting_Started.md) to get the correct\nversion of the Rust compiler, then look through the `/kernel`, `/capsules`,\n`/chips`, and `/boards` directories.\n\nWe encourage contributions back to Tock and are happy to accept pull requests\nfor anything from small documentation fixes to whole new platforms.\nFor details, check out our [Contributing Guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\nTo get started, please do not hesitate to submit a PR. We\'ll happily guide you\nthrough any needed changes.\n\n\n### Keep Up To Date\n\nCheck out the [blog](https://www.tockos.org/blog/) where the **Talking Tock**\npost series highlights what\'s new in Tock. Also, follow\n[@talkingtock](https://twitter.com/talkingtock) on Twitter.\n\nYou can also browse our\n[email group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tock-dev)\nand our [Slack][slack] to see\ndiscussions on Tock development.\n\n[slack]: https://join.slack.com/t/tockos/shared_invite/enQtNDE5ODQyNDU4NTE1LWVjNTgzMTMwYzA1NDI1MjExZjljMjFmOTMxMGIwOGJlMjk0ZTI4YzY0NTYzNWM0ZmJmZGFjYmY5MTJiMDBlOTk\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nLicensed under either of\n\n- Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or\n  http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n- MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or\n  http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nat your option.\n\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted\nfor inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall\nbe dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThe Tock Project Developers include dozens of contributors, some on behalf of\ntheir university, company, or organization.
