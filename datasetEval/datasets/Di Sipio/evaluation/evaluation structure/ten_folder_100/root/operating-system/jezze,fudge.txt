b'# FUDGE OPERATING SYSTEM\n\nhttp://www.fudgeos.com/\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nFudge is a small and elegant operating system. It started as a project to see if\nit would be possible to create an operating system that came as close as\npossible to be fully deterministic. Today, operating systems often show\nunpredictable behaviour because they implement technical solutions that are not\ndeterminstic in nature such as task scheduling, caching and dynamic memory\nallocation. Fudge tries to find alternative solutions to these problems and has\nso far been found to work quite well.\n\nDeterminism in the term of computers could mean many different things. It could\nmean that a program, given input, should always return a conclusive result.\nHowever unlikely that sounds it is actually quite common because of unwanted\nside-effects such as time delays or incorrectly handled input. Determinism could\nalso mean that every time you execute a program it will always take the same\namount of time to complete given the same input and the same environment in\nwhich it operates.\n\nFudge focus is on the latter where each programs should complete in the same\namount of time or as close as possible. This is not to be confused with a\nreal-time operating system that is only concerned about making sure each task is\nguaranteed a certain amount of time. Here instead we are concerned with the\nactual execution time. In order to achieve this Fudge will only run one task at\na time and will not interrupt the running task unless an interrupt occurs from\nhardware or software. This does not mean that Fudge is limited to only run one\ntask at a time because tasks can delay there own execution until such an\ninterrupt occurs and take presedence if the interrupt is of the type it was\nwaiting for. While Fudge operates in kernel mode it can not be interrupted at\nall so the kernel in that sense is fully deterministic. The kernel also does not\nkeep track of things in a dynamic fashion so each interrupt of the same type\nshould always take the exact same time as any previous. The kernel is not even\naware of the fact there can be many tasks running because it can only see the\ncurrent running one.\n\n## BUILDING FUDGE\n\nPlease see the building instructions on the website.\n\n## LICENCE\n\nPlease see the LICENCE file included in the source.\n\n## COMMUNITY\n\nCome talk to us on irc.\n\nServer: irc.freenode.net\nChannel: #fudge\n'
