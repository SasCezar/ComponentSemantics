b'Phosphorus Five - A RAD Web App Framework\n===============\n\nPhosphorus Five is a .Net based RAD Web Application Development Framework, for creating rich and\nsecure Ajax web apps. It allows you to orchestrate your apps together, almost as if they were made\nout of LEGO bricks.\n\n<p align="center">\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLll2Wx0yFo">\n<img alt="A one minute introduction video about Phosphorus Five" title="A one minute introduction video about Phosphorus Five" src="https://phosphorusfive.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screenshot-youtube-infomercial.png" />\n</a>\n</p>\n\nOut of the box, Phosphorus Five contains the following components.\n\n* __Hyper IDE__ - A web based IDE, with support for 100+ programming languages\n* __Camphora Five__ - A CRUD app generator allowing you to create rich CRUD apps in seconds\n* __Hypereval__ - A Hyperlambda web based _"PowerShell executor"_ and a snippets database\n\n... plus more.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install Phosphorus Five on a production Ubuntu/Linux server with an automated script, taking care of all dependencies. Or\nyou can download its code version, and play around with it locally, on your Windows, Mac, or Linux machine. If you choose the latter, you will\nhave to [make sure you have MySQL Server installed somehow](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) on your computer.\nIn addition, you need [Visual Studio/Xamarin](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) or [Mono Develop](https://www.monodevelop.com/) to\nuse the source code version.\n\n* [Download and install Phosphorus Five here](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive/releases) - Both binary release and source code\n\n**Notice - Source Code** - If you download the source version, make sure you edit the `/core/p5.webapp/web.config` file, such that it contains the correct\nconnection string for your MySQL installation. This normally implies simply adding your password to the existing connection string.\nPhosphorus Five will run without a valid MySQL database connection string - However, some of its apps will not function at all,\nor at their peak performance.\n\n**Notice - Binaries** - The automatic Linux script has only been tested on Ubuntu Server version 16.04.4, but might also work on other versions. This script\nwill also _sigificantly_ increase the security of your box, in addition to patching your box, updating it, and making sure it\'s using the latest\nstable versions of all software it installs - Such as for instance Mono version 5.10. The script expects a _"vanilla"_ Linux Ubuntu Server, and will\n_remove_ any existing websites you have configured for your Apache folder.\n\n**Notice - Source Code version on Windows** - If you use the source code version on Windows in Visual Studio, _make sure you turn off "browser sync"\nin Visual Studio_.\n\n## Performance\n\nOn average, you can expect a Phosphorus Five web app to perform at least 10x as fast, compared to literally anything else\nout there. Below is a YouTube video demonstrating the performance of Hyper IDE versus Visual Studio Community Edition on\na MacBook Air. To edit a simple CSS file in Visual Studio requires at least 3 times as much time, due to Visual Studio being slow.\nIn the video below, I start Hyper IDE up after having started Visual Studio, and I am done with my work in Hyper IDE, before Visual\nStudio have even loaded.\n\n<p align="center">\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97Tkg6DgOY">\n<img alt="A one minute performance demonstration of Hyper IDE versus Visual Studio" title="A one minute performance demonstration of Hyper IDE versus Visual Studio" src="https://phosphorusfive.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/how-fast-is-hyper-ide-compared-to-visual-studio.png" />\n</a>\n</p>\n\n## Productivity\n\nPhosphorus Five is created around the axiom that you should become at least 10x more productive. For some tasks,\nyour productivity will soar to extreme heights, such as I demonstrate in the video below, where I create\na rich database CRUD app in 2 minutes using the integrated Camphora Five CRUD app generator.\n\n<p align="center">\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMs-Tltf_Og">\n<img alt="In this video I am creating an address book type of web app in 5 seconds" title="In this video I am creating an address book type of web app in 5 seconds" src="https://phosphorusfive.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/camphora-five-address-book-youtube-video.png" />\n</a>\n</p>\n\n\n## MSDN Magazine articles about Phosphorus Five\n\n1.
