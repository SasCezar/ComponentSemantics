b'**Sparrow** is an embedded operating system.\n\n![SparrowOS](https://raw.github.com/michael2012z/Sparrow/master/doc/logo_280x160.png)\n\nNow it supports S3C6410X chipset (ARM architecture) only, and run in Skyeye simulator.\n\nThe name "Sparrow" comes from a famous Chinese proverb - "Sparrow may be small but perfectly formed". I hope it has every important features of modern system, but not too complex.\n\nTo share the knowledge how an operating system is created, I compiled some document. But usually design document is always boring, so I made as many diagrams as possible to illustrate the most important mechanism. Hope the cartoon-style document let the readers feel relaxed. These slides are also available in doc folder of the repository.\n\nThe author, I, am a software engineer working in Ericsson.
