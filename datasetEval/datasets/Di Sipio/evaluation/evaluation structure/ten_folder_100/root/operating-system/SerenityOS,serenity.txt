b'# Serenity\n\nGraphical Unix-like operating system for x86 computers.\n\n![Travis CI status](https://api.travis-ci.com/SerenityOS/serenity.svg?branch=master)\n\n## About\n\n*I always wondered what it would be like to write my own operating system, but I never took it seriously. Until now.*\n\nSerenity is a love letter to \'90s user interfaces with a custom Unix-like core. It flatters with sincerity by stealing beautiful ideas from various other systems.\n\nRoughly speaking, the goal is a marriage between the aesthetic of late-1990s productivity software and the power-user accessibility of late-2000s \\*nix. This is a system by me, for me, based on the things I like.\n\nIf you like some of the same things, you are welcome to join the project. It would be great to one day change the above to say "this is a system by us, for us, based on the things we like." :^)\n\nI regularly post raw hacking sessions and demos on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndreasKling/).\n\nSometimes I write about the system on [my github.io blog](https://awesomekling.github.io/).\n\nThere\'s also a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/serenityos) if you would like to show some support that way.\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Screenshot as of 1133aca](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SerenityOS/serenity/master/Meta/screenshot-1133aca.png)\n\n## Current features (all under development)\n\n* Pre-emptive multitasking\n* Multithreading\n* Compositing window server\n* IPv4 networking with ARP, TCP, UDP and ICMP\n* ext2 filesystem\n* Unix-like libc and userland\n* POSIX signals\n* Shell with pipes and I/O redirection\n* mmap()\n* /proc filesystem\n* Local sockets\n* Pseudoterminals (with /dev/pts filesystem)\n* Filesystem notifications\n* JSON framework\n* Low-level utility library (LibCore)\n* Mid-level 2D graphics library (LibDraw)\n* High-level GUI library (LibGUI)\n* HTML/CSS engine\n* Web browser\n* C++ IDE\n* Emojis (UTF-8)\n* HTTP downloads\n* SoundBlaster 16 driver\n* Software-mixing sound daemon\n* WAV playback\n* Simple desktop piano/synthesizer\n* Visual GUI design tool\n* PNG format support\n* Text editor\n* IRC client\n* Simple painting application\n* DNS lookup\n* Desktop games: Minesweeper and Snake\n* Ports system (needs more packages!)\n* Other stuff I can\'t think of right now...\n\n## How do I build and run this?\n\nMake sure you have all the dependencies installed:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install build-essential curl libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev libgmp-dev e2fsprogs qemu-system-i386 qemu-utils\n```\n\nEnsure your gcc version is >= 8 with `gcc --version`. Otherwise, install it (on Ubuntu) with:\n```bash\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\nsudo apt-get install gcc-8 g++-8\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 800 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8\n```\n\nGo into the `Toolchain/` directory and run the **BuildIt.sh** script. Then ***source*** the **UseIt.sh** script to put the `i686-pc-serenity` toolchain in your `$PATH`.\n\nOnce you\'ve done both of those, go into the `Kernel/` directory, then run\n**./makeall.sh**, and if nothing breaks too much, take it for a spin by using\n**./run**.\n\nYou can vastly reduce the build time of successive rebuilds of Serenity by installing `ccache` and `export`ing ```PRE_CXX=ccache```\n\nBare curious users may even consider sourcing suitable hardware to [install Serenity on a physical PC.](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/master/INSTALL.md)\n\nLater on, when you `git pull` to get the latest changes, there\'s no need to rebuild the toolchain. You can simply rerun **./makeall.sh** in the `Kernel/` directory and you\'ll be good to **./run** again.\n\n## IRC\n\nCome chat in `#serenityos` on the Freenode IRC network.\n\n## Author\n\n* **Andreas Kling** - [awesomekling](https://twitter.com/awesomekling)\n\n## Contributors\n\n* **Robin Burchell** - [rburchell](https://github.com/rburchell)\n* **Conrad Pankoff** - [deoxxa](https://github.com/deoxxa)\n* **Sergey Bugaev** - [bugaevc](https://github.com/bugaevc)\n\n(And many more!)
