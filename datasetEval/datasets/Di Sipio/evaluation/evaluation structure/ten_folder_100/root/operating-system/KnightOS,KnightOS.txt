b"# KnightOS\n\n**KnightOS** is a third-party operating system for TI calculators. It provides a\npassable Unix-like system for calculators. KnightOS is built on top of [the\nKnightOS kernel](https://github.com/KnightOS/kernel) - this repository is the\nofficial userspace. KnightOS runs on the following calculators:\n\n* TI-73\n* TI-83+\n* TI-83+ Silver Edition\n* TI-84+\n* TI-84+ Silver Edition\n* TI-84+ Color Silver Edition\n\nKnightOS also runs on the French variations of these same calculators.\n\n## What is this repository?\n\nAll of the pieces of KnightOS are maintained as separate projects under the\nKnightOS organization [on GitHub](https://github.com/KnightOS). This project\nexists to tie them all together. The `package.config` file lists the packages\nthat are installed on the default userspace. The KnightOS SDK is used to install\nthese packages, and then the default KnightOS settings are installed on top of\nthat. Additionally, this builds upgrade files and applies any required exploits.\n\n## Compiling\n\nTo compile KnightOS, first install the KnightOS SDK. Instructions for the SDK\ninstallation can be found [on the website](https://knightos.org/sdk).\n\nIn addition to the SDK, you will need\n[mktiupgrade](https://github.com/KnightOS/mktiupgrade),\n[sass](https://github.com/KnightOS/sass) and [kimg](https://github.com/KnightOS/kimg).\n\nThen, run the following:\n\n    knightos init --platform=<platform>\n\nChange `<platform>` to the appropriate platform for your needs:\n\n| Model                | `make` Target |\n| -------------------- | ------------- |\n| TI-73                | TI73          |\n| TI-73 Explorer       | TI73          |\n| TI-83+               | TI83p         |\n| TI-83+ SE            | TI83pSE       |\n| TI-84+               | TI84p         |\n| TI-84+ SE            | TI84pSE       |\n| TI-84+ CSE           | TI84pCSE      |\n| TI-84 Pocket.fr      | TI84p         |\n| TI-84 Plus Pocket SE | TI84pSE       |\n\nThen you can use various make targets to compile the system:\n\n    make            # Compiles and places a ROM file in bin/\n    make upgrade    # Compiles and places an upgrade file in bin/\n    make run        # Compiles and runs in an emulator\n    make debug      # Compiles and runs in a debugger\n\nIf you just want something you can install on your calculator, try `make\nupgrade` and check the `bin/` directory. Installation instructions are available\nonline at http://www.knightos.org/download.\n\n## Custom Kernels\n\nYou can use a custom kernel during development if you like. Add\n`--kernel-source=/path/to/your/kernel` to `knightos init`. You will, of course,\nneed to install all of the kernel's dependencies for this to work.\n\n## Help, Bugs, Feedback\n\nIf you need help with KnightOS, want to keep up with progress, chat with\ndevelopers, or ask any other questions about KnightOS, you can hang out in the\nIRC channel: [#knightos on irc.freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=knightos).\nYou can also subscribe to our [mailing list](http://lists.knightos.org/).\n\nTo report bugs, please create [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/KnightOS/KnightOS/issues/new) or contact us on [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=knightos).\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to the project, please see the [contribution guidelines](http://www.knightos.org/contributing).\n"
