b"This release has been built on Linux Mint (a Ubuntu derivative), using\nVincent Rivi\xc3\xa8re's GCC 4.6.4 cross-compiler.  The custom tools used in\nthe build process were built with native GCC 4.8.4.\n\nThe source package and other binary packages are available at:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/0.9.12/\n\nThe extras directory (if provided) contains:\n(1) one or more alternate desktop icon sets, which you can use to replace\n    the builtin ones.  You can use a standard resource editor to see what\n    the replacement icons look like.\n    To use a replacement set, move or rename the existing emuicon.rsc &\n    emuicon.def files in the root directory, then copy the files containing\n    the desired icons to the root, and rename them to emuicon.rsc/emuicon.def.\n(2) a sample mouse cursor set in a resource (emucurs.rsc/emucurs.def).  This\n    set is the same as the builtin ones, but you can use it as a basis to\n    create your own mouse cursors.\n    To use a replacement set, copy the files containing the desired mouse\n    cursors to the root, and rename them to emucurs.rsc/emucurs.def.\nFor further information on the above, see doc/emudesk.txt.\n\nIf you want to read more about EmuTOS, please take a look at these files:\n\ndoc/announce.txt      - Introduction and general description, including\n                        a summary of changes since the previous version\ndoc/authors.txt       - A list of the authors of EmuTOS\ndoc/bugs.txt          - Currently known bugs\ndoc/changelog.txt     - A summarised list of changes after release 0.9.4\ndoc/emudesk.txt       - A brief guide to the newer features of the desktop\ndoc/incompatible.txt  - Programs incompatible with EmuTOS due to program bugs\ndoc/license.txt       - The FSF General Public License for EmuTOS\ndoc/status.txt        - What is implemented and running (or not yet)\ndoc/todo.txt          - What should be done in future versions\ndoc/xhdi.txt          - Current XHDI implementation status\n\nAdditional information for developers (just in the source archive):\n\ndoc/install.txt       - How to build EmuTOS from sources\ndoc/coding.txt        - EmuTOS coding standards (never used :-) )\ndoc/country.txt       - An overview of i18n issues in EmuTOS\ndoc/fat16.txt         - Notes on the FAT16 filesystem in EmuTOS\ndoc/memdetect.txt     - Memory bank detection during EmuTOS startup\ndoc/nls.txt           - How to add a native language or use one\ndoc/old_changelog.txt - A summarised list of changes up to & including\n                        release 0.9.4\ndoc/osmemory.txt      - All about OS internal memory in EmuTOS\ndoc/reschange.txt     - How resolution change works in the desktop\ndoc/resource.txt      - Modifying resources in EmuTOS\ndoc/startup.txt       - Some notes on the EmuTOS startup sequence\ndoc/tos14fix.txt      - Lists bugs fixed by TOS 1.04 & their status in EmuTOS\n\nThe following documents are principally of historical interest only:\n\ndoc/old_code.txt      - A museum of bugs due to old C language\ndoc/vdibind.txt       - Old information on VDI bindings\n\n-- \nThe EmuTOS development team\nhttps://emutos.sourceforge.io/\n"
