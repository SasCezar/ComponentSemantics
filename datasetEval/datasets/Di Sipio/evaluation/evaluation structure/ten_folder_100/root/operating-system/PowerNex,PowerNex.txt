b'# **Please note that the current code is undergoing a major overhaul!**\n\n<p align="center">\n<img alt="PowerNex Logo" width="346" src="https://github.com/PowerNex/PowerNex/raw/master/data/logo.png">\n</p>\n\n\n**PowerNex** is a OS written in the [D Programming Language](https://dlang.org).\nThe goal is to have a whole OS written in D, where the PowerNex kernel powers the core.\n\nThe name PowerNex comes from the words `power` and `next`. A kernel to power the\nnext generation of hardware.\n\n## System requirements ##\n- A 64bit processor\n- At least 512 MiB of ram (less will probably work)\n\n## Build Instructions ##\nIt requires a crosscompiler, which can be aquired by running `./toolchainManager.d`.\nPowerNex is using a custom build system. For its code look inside `build.d`, `src/buildlib.d`, and `src/*/project.d`.\n\nTo use the following shortcuts run `source env.sh` in your shell.\n- **`c`** - Removes the build files\n- **`v`** - Compiles PowerNex\n- **`b`** - Compiles and runs PowerNex in qemu\n- **`bd`** - Compiles and runs PowerNex in qemu, with debug logs to qemu_debug.log\n- **`a`** - Runs *addr2line* on the kernel\n- **`al`** - Runs *addr2line* on the loader\n- **`log`** - Runs *tail* on the COM1.log, and demangles and inserts colors for the entries.\n\n## How to contribute ##\n- Make issues\n- Make PRs\n- Comment on issues\n  - Example help with [#30 Mascot](https://github.com/PowerNex/PowerNex/issues/30)\n- Donate\n  - One time donations (to Wild): [https://www.paypal.me/Vild](https://www.paypal.me/Vild)\n\n## Thanks to ##\n- Adam D. Ruppe - For his [minimal.zip](http://arsdnet.net/dcode/minimal.zip), which contains a bare bone minimal d runtime.\n- Bloodmanovski - For his D Kernel [Trinix](https://github.com/Bloodmanovski/Trinix), His files for booting x64 really helped me a lot in the beginning.\n- Lukas "zrho" Heidemann - For his [Hydrogen](https://github.com/zrho/Hydrogen) project. It really inspired and help me to make PowerD, the intermediate bootloader.\n\n## Community ##\n- #powernex on freenode\n- https://discordapp.com/invite/bMZk9Q4\n\n## License ##\nMozilla Public License, version 2.0'
