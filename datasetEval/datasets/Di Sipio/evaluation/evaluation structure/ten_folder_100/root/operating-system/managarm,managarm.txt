b"# The managarm Operating System\n\n![Screenshot](../assets/screenshots/echo-hello-managarm.png?raw=true)\n\n## What is this about?\n\nThis is the main repository of managarm, a microkernel-based operating system.\n\n**What is special about managarm?** Some notable properties of managarm are:\n(i) managarm is based on a microkernel while common Desktop operating systems like Linux and Windows use monolithic kernels,\n(ii) managarm uses a completely asynchronous API for I/O\nand (iii) despite those internal differences, managarm provides good compatibility with Linux at the user space level.\n\n**Aren't microkernels slow?** Microkernels do have some performance disadvantages over monolithic kernels.\nmanagarm tries to mitigate some of those issues by providing good abstractions (at the driver and system call levels)\nthat allow efficient implementations of common user space functionality (like POSIX).\n\n**Is this a Linux distribution?** No, managarm runs its own kernel that does not originate from Linux.\nWhile the managarm user space API supports many Linux APIs (e.g. epoll, timerfd, signalfd or tmpfs),\nmanagarm does not share any source code (or binaries) with the Linux kernel.\n\n## Trying out managarm\n\nWe provide [nightly builds](https://ci.managarm.org/job/managarm-nightly/)\nof managarm. If you want to try out managarm without building the whole OS, you can download a\nxz-compressed [nightly image](https://pkgs.managarm.org/nightly/image.xz).\nTo run the (uncompressed) image using qemu, we recommend the following flags:\n\n`qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1024 -device piix3-usb-uhci -device usb-kbd -device usb-tablet -drive id=hdd,file=image,format=raw,if=none -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=hdd -vga virtio -debugcon stdio`\n\n## Supported Software\n\nPrograms supported on managarm include [Weston](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston/) (the Wayland reference compositor), [kmscon](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/kmscon/) (a system console), GNU Coreutils, Bash, nano and others.\n\n## Supported Hardware\n**General** USB (UHCI, EHCI)\\\n**Graphics** Generic VBE graphics, Intel G45, virtio GPU, Bochs VBE interface, VMWare SVGA\\\n**Input** USB human interface devices, PS/2 keyboard and mouse\\\n**Storage** USB mass storage devices, ATA, virtio block\n\n## Building managarm\n\nWhile this repository contains managarm's kernel, its drivers and other core functionality,\nit is not enough to build a full managarm distribution. Instead, we refer to the\n[bootstrap-managarm](https://github.com/managarm/bootstrap-managarm) repository for build instructions.\n"
