It is designed to be simple to understand, extend, and develop for. Pebble does not aim for POSIX compliance.\nThe best way to learn about Pebble is to read [the book](https://isaacwoods.github.io/pebble/book/). [The website](https://isaacwoods.github.io/pebble) also hosts other useful resources, such as `rustdoc`-generated\ndocumentation of the components.\n\n## Contributing\nYou are very welcome to contribute to Pebble!
