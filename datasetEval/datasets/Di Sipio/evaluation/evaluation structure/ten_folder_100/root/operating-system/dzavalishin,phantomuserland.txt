b'# Welcome to Phantom OS #\n\nPhantom OS is a persistent operating system. Its primary goal\nis to provide environment for programs that does survive OS\nreboot. Such an environment greatly simplifies software development\nand makes it possible to write programs that, for example, do not need filesystem.\n\nNevertheless, Phantom supports filesystems and all of the modern OS features.\n\nFor the details please refer to the [Phantom OS Programmer\'s guide](https://phantomdox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nFor the questions and discussion please visit [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/phantom-os).\n\n## What Phantom OS is ##\n\n*   [Phantom OS Programmer\'s guide](https://phantomdox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n*   [Phantom Architecture in English](https://github.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland/wiki/PhantomArchitecture)\n*   [Short article in English - TheRegister](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/03/phantom_russian_os/)\n*   [Big article in Russian - Open Systems Magazine](http://www.osp.ru/os/2011/03/13008200/)\n\nBasically, most of code we (the original team) upload is very straighforward\nand, sometimes, dumb. That, to some extent, is on purpose. We want to have\na working system first and polish it next. Besides, not all the concepts and\ndesign desicions are final, so it is of no use to finalize all the \nimplementation desisions now as well.\n\nCode is known to compile successfully with cygwin/linux gcc 4.3.4.\nOnly ia32 target is most complete and stable, arm port is in active development\nbut very instable, mips port is just started - compiles and can breath for a\nsecond :), amd64 port is incomplete and does not compile at all.\n\n[How to take part](https://github.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland/wiki/HowToTakePart)\n\n## Current state ##\n\nSee [ChangeLog](https://github.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland/wiki/ChangeLog), look at [ScreenShots](https://github.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland/wiki/ScreenShots), and here is the last one:\n\n![](https://github.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland/blob/master/doc/images/Phantom_screen_Controls_21_10_2019.png?raw=true)\n\nMore screenshots:  <https://github.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland/wiki/ScreenShots>\n\n## Dox ##\n\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/phantomdox/badge/?version=latest)](https://phantomdox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n     \n[Web Documentation](https://phantomdox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [PDF](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/phantomdox/latest/phantomdox.pdf), and there\'s a lot of info in \n[WIKI](https://github.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland/wiki)\n\n## Build ##\n\n  Set \'\'\'PHANTOM_HOME\'\'\' environment variable to the path to Phantom repository root directory,\n  "make all" there.\n\n  In Windows you will need Cygwin to do that. <http://www.cygwin.com>\n  Select, at least: gcc4, subversion, binutils, make, gdb\n  (see etc/cygwin_get.cmd)\n  \n  See also [TOOLCHAIN](https://github.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland/blob/master/TOOLCHAIN)\n\n## Run ##\n\n  Run phantom.cmd/phantom.sh in /run\n  \n  See doc/RUNNING for more details\n\n## Debug ##\n\n  Run QEMU (see above) and then - gdb in /oldtree/kernel/phantom\n\n  Kernel console is logged to /run/serial0.log \n\n  Kernel is able to send logging info to syslogd by UDP.\n  Currently syslogd address is hardcoded in net_misc.c.\n\n## Directories ##\n\n* oldtree/kernel/phantom - kernel \n* phantom                - libs and unix userland (user/apps)\n* plib/sys/src           - native phantom userland code\n* run                    - QEMU run/test environment\n* tools/plc              - phantom language compiler / java bytecode translator\n\n## Go on and take part ##\n\n### Kernel and compiler\n\nCreating an unusual operating system is a very interesting thing to do. There are challenges on each and every step.\nJust to start with:\n\n* Persistent memory **garbage collector**. Suppose we\'re in a 64 bit world and persistent memory size is some 20 Tb. Current GC is incomplete.\n* If we touch memory too much snapshot engine will spend a lot of IO to store difference. Fast and good **allocator** can reduce IO load. There is one, but it could be better.\n* There\'s need for a fast alpha-blending **image transfer (bitblt)** code.\n* Unix subsystem is very limited. No **signal delivery**, for example. It waits for one who will implement missing parts.\n* It is theoretically possible to implement a **persistent Unix environment**. Quite challenging.\n* Drivers - current set is minimal, **AHCI driver** is not complete, **USB needs optimization**, some more must be ported or written.\n* It would be interesting to add **Python frontend** to Phantom compiler. Are you a Python fan? Can help?\n* Phantom bytecode supports classes, inheritance, but does not support interfaces. It is not really trivial to **implement interfaces** in an efficient way.\n* Even **simple JIT engine** will help a lot.\n* **TCP stack** is not ideal and needs someone to lend a hand.\n\n### Porting Phantom\n\nPorts to **ARM** and **MIPS** were started, but long time no progress. I look for one who can help with that.\n\nBringing it to **64 bit Intel/AMD** is actual task too. \n\nCurrent kernel is basically SMP ready, but **SMP support** is not finished completely.\n\n### Userland\n\nThere\'s need to implement **demo applications for Phantom** - even simple ones will help.\n\nMore serious task is to bring in some simple **HTML renderer** and get basic browser working.\n\n### Build and CI\n\n* There is a need for a **good CI setup** which can run system in a specific configurations and following special scenarios.\n* Bytecode engine needs to be tested with **random garbage execution**.\n* It is a good idea to keep **set of tools** that for sure build correct OS kernel. cc/binutils/qemu, etc.\n* Need setup to build **ISO image** of system to run on different machines and emulators.\n* There is real need to do **CI on a real hadrware**. Need corresponding scripts.\n\nIf you feel interested to take part in a project, please leave me a note. An issue on a GitHub is ideal communications channel.\n\n[Issues to start with](https://github.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\n\n## Badges ##\n\n[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/8eec7d75d73b4a93b45a1befa3b70696)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/dzavalishin/phantomuserland?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=dzavalishin/phantomuserland&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland)\n\n[![Code coverage][COVERAGE_BADGE]][COVERAGE_LINK]\n\n[COVERAGE_LINK]:https://scan.coverity.com/projects/dzavalishin-phantomuserland\n\n[COVERAGE_BADGE]:https://scan.coverity.com/projects/8024/badge.svg\n\n## Communications ##\n\nEasiest way is to [Write e-mail to Dmitry Zavalishin](mailto:dz@dz.ru)\n\nOr leave a message in [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/phantom-os)\n\nOr leave an issue in [tracker](https://github.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland/issues)\n\nHere is an [Phantom Web Site](http://phantomos.org/), but since you\'re here you\nbetter look at [Wiki](https://github.com/dzavalishin/phantomuserland/wiki).\n\n<hr>\n\nBest regards, Dmitry Zavalishin,\n<dz@dz.ru>\n'
