It\xe2\x80\x99s most directly descended from [Plan 9 from Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs). This heritage spans from its distributed application architecture all the way down to much of its code. However, Harvey aims to be a more practical, general-purpose operating system, so it also uses ideas and code from other systems.\n\n### Getting started\n\nStart by reading the [Wiki](https://github.com/Harvey-OS/harvey/wiki).\nThere\'s a [Getting Started](https://github.com/Harvey-OS/harvey/wiki/Getting-Started)\nguide there to learn how to get Harvey up and running and many other things.\n\n### Contributing\n\nYou enjoyed playing with Harvey and you want to help out?
