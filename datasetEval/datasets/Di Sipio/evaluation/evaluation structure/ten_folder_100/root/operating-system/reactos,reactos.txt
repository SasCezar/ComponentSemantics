This means that ReactOS is under heavy development, things may not work well and it can corrupt the data present on your hard disk. It is recommended to test ReactOS on a virtual machine or on a computer with no sensitive or critical data!***\n\n## Building\n\n[![appveyor.badge]][appveyor.link] [![travis.badge]][travis.link] [![rosbewin.badge]][rosbewin.link] [![rosbeunix.badge]][rosbeunix.link] [![coverity.badge]][coverity.link]\n\nTo build the system it is strongly advised to use the _ReactOS Build Environment (RosBE)._\nUp-to-date versions for Windows and for Unix/GNU-Linux are available from our download page at: ["Build Environment"](http://www.reactos.org/wiki/Build_Environment).\n\nAlternatively one can use Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) version 2010+. Building with MSVC is covered here: ["Visual Studio or Microsoft Visual C++"](https://www.reactos.org/wiki/CMake#Visual_Studio_or_Microsoft_Visual_C.2B.2B).\n\n### Binaries\n\nTo build ReactOS you must run the `configure` script in the directory you want to have your build files. Choose `configure.cmd` or `configure.sh` depending on your system. Then run `ninja <modulename>` to build a module you want or just `ninja` to build all modules.\n\n### Bootable images\n\nTo build a bootable CD image run `ninja bootcd` from the\nbuild directory. This will create a CD image with a filename `bootcd.iso`.\n\nSee ["Building ReactOS"](http://www.reactos.org/wiki/Building_ReactOS) for more details.\n\nYou can always download fresh binary builds of bootable images from the ["Daily builds"](https://www.reactos.org/getbuilds/) page.\n\n## Installing\n\nBy default, ReactOS currently can only be installed on a machine that has a FAT16 or FAT32 partition as the active (bootable) partition. \nThe partition on which ReactOS is to be installed (which may or may not be the bootable partition) must also be formatted as FAT16 or FAT32.\nReactOS Setup can format the partitions if needed.\n\nStarting 0.4.10, ReactOS can be installed using the BtrFS file system. But\nconsider this as an experimental feature and thus regressions not triggered on\nFAT setup may be observed.\n\nTo install ReactOS from the bootable CD distribution, extract the archive contents. Then burn the CD image, boot from it, and follow the instructions.\n\nSee ["Installing ReactOS"](https://www.reactos.org/wiki/Installing_ReactOS) Wiki page or [INSTALL](INSTALL) for more details.\n\n## Testing\n\nIf you discover a bug in ReactOS search on JIRA first - it might be reported already. If not report the bug providing logs and as much information as possible.\n\nSee ["File Bugs"](https://www.reactos.org/wiki/File_Bugs) for a guide.\n\n__NOTE:__ The bug tracker is _not_ for discussions. Please use `#reactos` Freenode IRC channel or our [forum](https://reactos.org/forum).\n\n## Contributing  ![prwelcome.badge]\n\nWe are always looking for developers! Check [how to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are willing to participate.\n\nYou can also support ReactOS by [donating](https://reactos.org/donating)! We rely on our backers to maintain our servers and accelerate development by [hiring full-time devs](https://reactos.org/node/785).\n\n## More information\n\nReactOS is a Free and Open Source operating system based on the Windows architecture, \nproviding support for existing applications and drivers, and an alternative to the current dominant consumer operating system.\n\nIt is not another wrapper built on Linux, like WINE. It does not attempt or plan to compete with WINE; in fact, the user-mode part of ReactOS is almost entirely WINE-based and our two teams have cooperated closely in the past. \n\nReactOS is also not "yet another OS". It does not attempt to be a third player like any other alternative OS out there. People are not meant to uninstall Linux and use ReactOS instead; ReactOS is a replacement for Windows users who want a Windows replacement that behaves just like Windows.\n\nMore information is available at: [reactos.org](https://www.reactos.org).\n\nAlso see the [media/doc](/media/doc/) subdirectory for some sparse notes.\n\n## Who is responsible\n\nActive devs are listed as members of [GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/reactos/people).\nSee also the [CREDITS](CREDITS) file for others.\n\n## Code mirrors\n\nThe main development is done on [GitHub](https://github.com/reactos/reactos). We have an [alternative mirror](https://git.reactos.org/?p=reactos.git) in case GitHub is down.\n\nThere is also an obsolete [SVN archive repository](https://svn.reactos.org/reactos/) that is kept for historical purposes.\n\n[travis.badge]:     https://travis-ci.org/reactos/reactos.svg?branch=master\n[appveyor.badge]:   https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/reactos/reactos?branch=master&svg=true\n[coverity.badge]:   https://scan.coverity.com/projects/205/badge.svg?flat=1\n[rosbewin.badge]:   https://img.shields.io/badge/RosBE_Windows-2.1.6-0688CB.svg\n[rosbeunix.badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/RosBE_Unix-2.1.2-0688CB.svg\n[prwelcome.badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/PR-welcome-0688CB.svg\n\n[travis.link]:      https://travis-ci.org/reactos/reactos\n[appveyor.link]:    https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AmineKhaldi/reactos\n[coverity.link]:    https://scan.coverity.com/projects/205\n[rosbewin.link]:    https://sourceforge.net/projects/reactos/files/RosBE-Windows/i386/2.1.6/\n[rosbeunix.link]:   https://sourceforge.net/projects/reactos/files/RosBE-Unix/2.1.2/\n'
