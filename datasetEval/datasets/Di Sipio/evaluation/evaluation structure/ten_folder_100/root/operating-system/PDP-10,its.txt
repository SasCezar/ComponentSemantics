b"# Incompatible Timesharing System\n\n[![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PDP-10/its.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PDP-10/its)\n[![GitLab CI Build Status](https://gitlab.com/PDP-10/its/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/PDP-10/its/commits/master)\n\n### About ITS\n\nITS, the Incompatible Timesharing System, is an operating system for\nthe PDP-10 computer family.  It was created by hackers at MIT in the\n1960s.  The MIT site was shut down in 1990, but enthusiasts continue\nto operate ITS systems to this day.\n\nSome notable ITS features:\n\n- Hosted the first versions of Emacs, Zork, Macsyma, Maclisp, Scheme, and\n  multi-player Maze War\n- Virtual memory\n- User-space device drivers\n- Networking: TCP/IP, ARPAnet, Chaosnet\n- Transparent network file system\n- Terminal-independent text output\n- Graphical workstations\n\nThere is a mailing list for discussion about ITS.  Go to\nhttp://its.victor.se/mailman/listinfo/its-hackers_its.victor.se\nfor more information.\n\n### About this project\n\nThis repository contains source code, tools, and scripts to build an\nITS system from scratch.\n\nThe goals are:\n\n- To provide an automated build from start to end.  No user\n  intervention is necessary.\n\n- To check which programs have source code, and [which programs are missing\n  source code](https://github.com/PDP-10/its/issues/61).\n\n- To ensure that we know how to build all programs.\n\n- To update programs with the latest bug fixes and enhancements.\n\n- To be able to set configurable options across the whole system, such\n  as host name, IP address, hardware devices.\n\nThe build currently runs on the SIMH and KLH10 emulators.  Of course,\nwe'd be delighted to test this on a real KS10.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo build ITS with this repository, you need some tools installed:\nmake, C compiler, and expect.  For KA10, you also need SDL or SDL2 for\nthe Type 340 display.  Ensure all submodules are checked out, and then\ntype `make EMULATOR=simh`, `make EMULATOR=pdp10-ka`, `make\nEMULATOR=pdp10-kl`, or `make EMULATOR=klh10`.  This will leave built\nfiles in the `out` directory, one of which is a disk image with ITS\ninstalled.\n\nTo start ITS, type `./start`.  If you see `KLH10#`, type `go` and\nEnter.  If you see the `DSKDMP` prompt, type `its`, press Enter, and\nthen `ESC g`.  If you use the `pdp10-kl` emulator there is no prompt\nand you need to type `Esc L ITS`, press Enter, and then `ESC g`.\nEventually, you will see `SYSTEM JOB USING THIS CONSOLE`.  You are now\nready to log in, so type Control-Z.  See [doc/DDT.md](doc/DDT.md) for\na list of useful commands.  When done, shut down orderly by typing\n`:lock` and then `5down`.\n\nITS can optionally use some additional peripheral devices.  To attach\na simulated GT40 graphics terminal, type `./start gt40` when booting\nITS.\n\nTo install your personal user files, add a subdirectory under `user`\nwith your files inside.  They will be copied to ITS.  The directory\nname is limited to six characters, and file names must have two\nsix-character parts separated by a period.\n\nHere is an overview of the repository:\n- bin - PDP-10 binary files necessary to bootstrap the system.\n- build - build scripts.\n- conf - configuration for building ITS.\n- doc - documentation, most of which appear in the INFO system.\n- src - source code for ITS and all programs.\n- tools - build tools.\n- out - build output.\n- user - optional user files installed in ITS.\n\n### Documentation\n\nSee the [`doc` subdirectory](doc) for documentation.\n\nThere are some short introductions for beginners:\n- [DDT cheat sheet for Unix users](doc/DDT.md)\n- [Basic editing with EMACS](doc/EMACS.md)\n- [TECO survival guide](doc/TECO.md)\n- [DDT debugging newbie guide](doc/debugging.md)\n- [Hello MIDAS](doc/hello-midas.md)\n- [DUMP and itstar](doc/DUMP-itstar.md)\n- [Games](doc/games.md)\n- [Printing](doc/printing.md)\n- [Assembling ITS](doc/NITS.md)\n- [Com link mode](doc/comlink.md)\n- [Logo](doc/logo.md)\n- [PDP-6](doc/pdp6.md)\n\nA list of [known ITS machines](doc/machines.md).\n\nHow [ITS is built](doc/build.md).\n\n### Applications\n\nSome major applications:\n\n- Adventure, game\n- C10, C compiler\n- DDT, debugger\n- Emacs, editor\n- Logo, interpreter\n- Mac Hack VI and Tech II, chess programs\n- Maclisp, interpreter and compiler\n- Muddle, interpreter\n- Macsyma, symbolic math\n- Maze War, game\n- Midas, assembler\n- PDP-11 simulator\n- Scheme, interpreter\n- Spacewar!, game\n- Stanford University Drawing System\n- TECO, editor\n- TOPS-10 and WAITS emulator\n\nThere is a [detailed list of all installed programs](doc/programs.md).\n\n### Network Support\n\nCurrently, networking is only supported under the KLH10 and SIMH KA10\nand KL10 emulators. The SIMH KS10 does not have the necessary\nsupport. As of this release, only the ITS monitor, host table tools,\nand binary host table are installed.\n\nCurrently, basic TCP network support is in the build, in addition to\nboth a TELNET/SUPDUP server, and both TELNET and SUPDUP clients.\nAdditionally, both an FTP server and client are included. Chaosnet TELNET \nand FTP (CHTN and CFTP), but this requires support and configuration\nin the emulator to actually use. SMTP mail inbound and outbound is included,\nas well as local mail delivery.\n\nThe KLH10 dskdmp.ini file has an IP address (192.168.1.100) and gateway IP \naddress (192.168.0.45) configured for the ITS system. The IP address \nmatches the address configured in SYSTEM; CONFIG > (as IMPUS3). Finally,\nthe HOST table source (SYSHST; H3TEXT >) and binary (SYSBIN; HOSTS3 >)\ndefined a host called DB-ITS.EXAMPLE.COM at the IP address 192.168.1.100.\n\nIn order to change the IP address of the host, you can edit IP, GW,\nand NETMASK in the file conf/network.  You can also set a Chaosnet\naddress.  After that, a full rebuild (e.g. `make clean all`) is required.\n"
