b'# Jupyter Notebook + Reveal.js\n\n## Introduction\n\nMicrosoft PowerPoint is cool. I like it! It is like a Swiss army knife for consultants. You can make beautiful slides with it. When it comes to code though, PowerPoint sucks. Really! The solution is to use [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). It is cool. You can use Markdown to highlight code. It is responsive but like LaTeX, it can be tedious.\n\nAnother way to use reveal.js is through Jupyter Notebook. You just create a notebook and then use `nbconvert` to get reveal.js slides as well. The standard output is however boring. I seriously mean it! This repo therefore tries to bridge this gap by using customized colors and images.\n\nMoreover, we live in a cloud native world with a cloud native lifestyle, cloud native storage, cloud native solution. Why not having cloud native presentation slides then? This repo also solves this problem by simply using `cf push`.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Create the conda environment:\n    ```\n    conda env create -f environment.yml\n    ```\n2. You can find a notebook template in the `static` folder which contains some examples like cover and divider slides, markdown syntax and many more. Here is a [link](http://www.slideviper.oquanta.info/tutorial/slideshow_tutorial_slides.html#/3) for a nice intro into creating slides with Jupyter notebook.\n3. When you are done with editing your notebook, you need to generate the slides with this command:\n    ```\n    # from ./jupyter2slides/\n    python create_slides.py --file static/presentation_template.ipynb\n    ```\n4. Now you can either call this command to serve the presentation on your local machine\n    ```\n    python run.py --file static/presentation_template.slides.html\n    ```\n    or just use `cf push` to push it to the cloud. I use Flask to serve those static files.\n\n5. To convert the slides to pdf, I use [decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape):\n    ```\n    cd decktape-1.0.0/\n    ./phantomjs decktape.js generic --keycode=Space "http://0.0.0.0:9099/" presentation_template.pdf\n    ```\n    or you can also use the [`?print-pdf`](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#pdf-export) option but this is not recommended as the formatting is not displayed correctly.\n\n#### Requirements:\n- Python 3.6.*\n- nbconvert 5.3.*\n- reveal.js 3.1.0\n\n#### Demo:\n- [Presentation Template](http://myslides-on-cf.cfapps.io/) | [PDF](https://www.slideshare.net/DatTran33/presentation-template-from-jupyter2slides)\n- [Interactive Template](http://interactive-slides.cfapps.io/) | [PDF](https://www.slideshare.net/DatTran33/interactive-slide-deck-jupyter2slides)\n\n## FAQ\n\n###### How can I change the color of the headline, text, links, list etc.?\nYou can change everything in the `custom.css` file.\n\n###### How can I change the footer?\nIf you need to change the footer, open `jupyter_template.tpl` and go to `Change footer here`.\n\n###### Where did you get the image and favicon?\nThe image used for the cover slide is from [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/) and the favicon is from [freefavicon](http://www.freefavicon.com/). They are both free to use.\n\n###### Does it work with other reveal.js version?\nYes, but this is not recommended as the colors might be broken due to differences in the css styles.\n\n## Copyright\n\nSee [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\nCopyright (c) 2016 [Dat Tran](http://www.dat-tran.com/).\n'
