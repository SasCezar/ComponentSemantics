Starting with a Hello World version, followed by the main neural network layers, and ending by training it to generalize. \n\nThe models are based on Tony Beltramelli\'s [pix2code](https://github.com/tonybeltramelli/pix2code), and inspired by Airbnb\'s [sketching interfaces](https://airbnb.design/sketching-interfaces/), and Harvard\'s [im2markup](https://github.com/harvardnlp/im2markup).\n\n**Note:** only the Bootstrap version can generalize on new design mock-ups. It uses 16 domain-specific tokens which are translated into HTML/CSS. It has a 97% accuracy. The best model uses a GRU instead of an LSTM. This version can be trained on a few GPUs. The raw HTML version has potential to generalize, but is still unproven and requires a significant amount of GPUs to train. The current model is also trained on a homogeneous and small dataset, thus it\'s hard to tell how well it behaves on more complex layouts.  \n\nA quick overview of the process: \n\n### 1) Give a design image to the trained neural network\n\n![Insert image](https://i.imgur.com/LDmoLLV.png)\n\n### 2) The neural network converts the image into HTML markup \n\n<img src="/README_images/html_display.gif?raw=true" width="800px">\n\n### 3) Rendered output\n\n![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/tEAfyZ8.png)\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### FloydHub\n\n[![Run on FloydHub](https://static.floydhub.com/button/button.svg)](https://floydhub.com/run?template=https://github.com/floydhub/pix2code-template)\n\nClick this button to open a [Workspace](https://blog.floydhub.com/workspaces/) on [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=pix2code&utm_campaign=aug_2018) where you will find the same environment and dataset used for the *Bootstrap version*. You can also find the trained models for testing.\n\n### Local\n``` bash\npip install keras tensorflow pillow h5py jupyter\n```\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/emilwallner/Screenshot-to-code.git\ncd Screenshot-to-code/\njupyter notebook\n```\nGo do the desired notebook, files that end with \'.ipynb\'. To run the model, go to the menu then click on Cell > Run all\n\nThe final version, the Bootstrap version, is prepared with a small set to test run the model. If you want to try it with all the data, you need to download the data here: https://www.floydhub.com/emilwallner/datasets/imagetocode, and specify the correct ```dir_name```.\n\n## Folder structure\n\n``` bash\n  |  |-Bootstrap                           #The Bootstrap version\n  |  |  |-compiler                         #A compiler to turn the tokens to HTML/CSS (by pix2code)\n  |  |  |-resources\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  |  |  |  |-eval_light                    #10 test images and markup\n  |  |-Hello_world                         #The Hello World version\n  |  |-HTML                                #The HTML version\n  |  |  |-Resources_for_index_file         #CSS,images and scripts to test index.html file\n  |  |  |-html                             #HTML files to train it on\n  |  |  |-images                           #Screenshots for training\n  |-readme_images                          #Images for the readme page\n```\n\n\n## Hello World\n<p align="center"><img src="/README_images/Hello_world_model.png?raw=true" width="400px"></p>\n\n\n## HTML\n<p align="center"><img src="/README_images/HTML_model.png?raw=true" width="400px"></p>\n\n\n## Bootstrap\n<p align="center"><img src="/README_images/Bootstrap_model.png?raw=true" width="400px"></p>\n\n## Model weights\n- [Bootstrap](https://www.floydhub.com/emilwallner/datasets/imagetocode) (The pre-trained model uses GRUs instead of LSTMs)\n- [HTML](https://www.floydhub.com/emilwallner/datasets/html_models)\n\n## Acknowledgments\n- Thanks to IBM for donating computing power through their PowerAI platform\n- The code is largely influenced by Tony Beltramelli\'s pix2code paper.
