You can select a specific branch name,\ncommit, or tag to serve.\n\nBinderHub ties together:\n\n- `JupyterHub <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub>`_ to provide\n  a scalable system for authenticating users and spawning single user\n  Jupyter Notebook servers, and\n\n- `Repo2Docker <https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker>`_ which generates\n  a Docker image using a Git repository hosted online.\n\nBinderHub is built with Python, kubernetes, tornado, npm, webpack, and sphinx.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nFor more information about the architecture, use, and setup of BinderHub, see\n`the BinderHub documentation <https://binderhub.readthedocs.io>`_.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nTo contribute to the BinderHub project you can work on:\n\n* `answering questions others have <https://discourse.jupyter.org/>`_,\n* writing documentation,\n* designing the user interface, or\n* writing code.\n\nTo see how to build the documentation, edit the user interface or modify the\ncode see `the contribution guide <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n**BinderHub** is based on Python 3, it's currently only hosted on GitHub\n(pip release soon). However, it can be installed using ``pip``::\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub\n\nSee `the BinderHub documentation <https://binderhub.readthedocs.io>`_ for\na detailed guide on setting up your own BinderHub server.\n\n\nWhy BinderHub?\n--------------\n\nCollections of Jupyter notebooks are becoming more common in scientific research\nand data science. The ability to serve these collections on demand enhances the\nusefulness of these notebooks.\n\n\nWho is BinderHub for?\n---------------------\n* **Users** who want to easily interact with computational environments that\n  others have created.\n* **Authors** who want to create links that allow users to immediately interact with a\n  computational enviroment that you specify.\n* **Deployers** who want to create their own BinderHub to run on whatever\n  hardware they choose.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSee ``LICENSE`` file in this repository.\n\n\n.. _BinderHub: https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub\n"
