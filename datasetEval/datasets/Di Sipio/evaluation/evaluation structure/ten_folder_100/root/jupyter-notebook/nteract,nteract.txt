The nteract desktop app ships with a NodeJS kernel by default. If you\'d like to use other Jupyter kernels, you will need to [install them](https://nteract.io/kernels).\n\n### Installing nteract web\n\nOur current flavor of nteract web runs on top of the Jupyter server. Install it with `pip`:\n\n```\npip install nteract_on_jupyter\njupyter serverextension enable nteract_on_jupyter\n```\n\nNow, run `jupyter nteract` and you\'re running nteract on the Jupyter web application!\n\n### Try the nteract playground\n\nThe nteract playground is a web-based application that allows you to write code and execute code in a web-based editor supported by Binder and Jupyter kernels. You can learn more about in the [nteract play GitHub repo](https://github.com/nteract/play).\n\n### User Guide\n\nTo learn more about using the nteract desktop app, please check out the [user guide](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/USER_GUIDE.md)\n\n---\n\n## Contributors\n\nThe contributors are listed in the [contributors](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/graphs/contributors) page on GitHub.\n\nTo learn how to contribute to nteract, head on over to our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThis project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nBy participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

In our\ncase, we have two main directories:\n\n```\npackages/ -- components used as an individual library\napplications/ -- all the user facing applications (i.e. desktop)\n```\n\nThe `packages` directory has the components needed to build new applications,\nand the `applications` has the desktop app and the Jupyter extension.\n\n_Why have a monorepo?_ The monorepo contains many components and packages that\ncan be mixed and remixed to create new applications. The monorepo keeps these\nelements together so they are easy to discover and use. Another benefit\nis that the monorepo makes it easy to iterate on applications that share\ncommon components. For example, if we update a component, such as the Jupyter\nmessage handling, and happen to introduce an issue when making a change to the\ndesktop app, we would notice the issue in tandem.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nTo get started developing, [set up the nteract monorepo](#set-the-monorepo-up-in-dev-mode).\n\n#### Set the monorepo up in dev mode\n\nRequires [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).\n\n1. Fork this repo\n2. Clone your fork or this repo `git clone https://github.com/nteract/nteract`\n3. `cd` to the directory where you `clone`d it\n4. `yarn install`\n\nTo keep up-to-date with changes to the root nteract/nteract branch:\n\n5. Set the root as a remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/nteract/nteract.git`\n\nWhen changes are made to the root nteract/nteract, they can then be pulled from the root and merged to your master branch:\n\n6. `git pull upstream master`\n7. `yarn clean`\n8. `yarn install`\n\n#### Building a specific package\n\nIn some cases you\'ll want to modify an individual base package (i.e. commutable\nor transforms) and not rebuild all of the other packages. To target a build of a\nspecific package, use this command, replacing `packageName` with the fully qualified name of the package you want to build:\n\n```\ntsc -b packageName\n```\n\nFor example, to hack on the `transforms` package, use\n\n```\ntsc -b packages/transforms\n```\n\n### Hacking on the web application\n\nIf you\'re looking to test out changes you make to the core SDK, the web application is the best integrated environment to test on. You can run the web application in development mode, by [configuring the Jupyter extension to run in development mode](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/applications/jupyter-extension/README.md#development).\n\n### Hacking on the desktop application\n\n#### Quick and dirty (manual)\n\n```\nyarn app:desktop\n```\n\nAs you make changes, you will have to close the entire app (CMD-q on macOS or\nCTRL-c at the terminal) and then run `yarn app:desktop` again to see the\nchanges.\n\n#### Progressive Webpack build (automatic)\n\nIn separate terminals run:\n\n```\nyarn build:desktop:watch\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nyarn spawn\n```\n\nThis progressive webpack build will keep rebuilding as you modify the source\ncode. When you open a new notebook, you\'ll get the fresh, up-to-date copy of\nthe notebook app.\n\n#### Logging\n\n`console.log` statements in the main Electron process are piped to stdout.\n`console.log` statements in the Electron renderer process go to the\nregular Dev Tools console (accessible from the View menu). Set\nELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=1 to pipe renderer `console.log` to the launching\nterminal as well. This is useful for debugging crashes and notebook closing\nbehaviors.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n> I upgraded my developer installation and things are broken!\n\n- Try `yarn clean && yarn`\n\n> I want to debug redux actions and state changes.\n\n- Enable [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger) by\n  spawning the application with `yarn spawn:debug`.\n\n> I keep getting a pop-up asking: _Do you want the application "nteract Helper.app" to accept\n> incoming network connections?_ while developing or using a custom build of\n> nteract on macOS.\n\n- This is how the the macOS firewall behaves for unsigned apps. On a signed app,\n  the dialog won\'t show up again after approving it the first time. If you\'re\n  using a custom build of nteract, run:\n\n  ```\n  sudo codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/nteract.app\n  ```\n\n  You will have to do this again every time you rebuild the app.\n\n---\n\n## Sponsors\n\nWork on the nteract notebook is currently sponsored by\n\n[![NumFocus](https://numfocus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NumFocus_LRG.png)](https://numfocus.salsalabs.org/donate-to-nteract/index.html)\n\nWe\'re on a common mission to build a great interactive computing experience.
