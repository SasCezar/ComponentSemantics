b'# Code of the IPython Cookbook, Second Edition (2018)\n\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipython-books/cookbook-2nd-code/master)\n\nThis repository contains the Jupyter notebooks of the 100+ recipes of [*IPython Interactive Computing and Visualization Cookbook, Second Edition (2018)*](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/ipython-interactive-computing-and-visualization-cookbook-second-e), by [Cyrille Rossant](http://cyrille.rossant.net), *Packt Publishing*.\n\nThis repository is read-only: the source files are on the [cookbook-2nd](https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-2nd) repository.\n\n\n## Running the code in the cloud\n\nWith [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), you can run most of the Jupyter notebooks directly from your web browser without installing anything. Just click on the `launch binder` button above. A temporary Jupyter Notebook server with all dependencies will be automatically launched in the cloud. It is not persistent: all your changes will be lost after some time.\n\n\n## Running the code on your computer\n\n1. [**Install** git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n\n2. [**Download and install** Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/): choose the **Python 3.6, 64-bit** version for your operating system (macOS, Linux, or Windows).\n\n3. **Open** a terminal (`cmd` on Windows).\n\n4. **Clone** the repository:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-2nd-code.git\n$ cd cookbook-2nd-code\n```\n\n5. **Create** the `cookbook` [conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file):\n\n```bash\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n```\n\n6. **Activate** the environment:\n\n    * On macOS and Linux:\n\n    ```bash\n    source activate cookbook\n    ```\n\n    * On Windows:\n\n    ```bash\n    activate cookbook\n    ```\n\n7. **Launch** the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html):\n\n```bash\n$ jupyter notebook\n```\n'
