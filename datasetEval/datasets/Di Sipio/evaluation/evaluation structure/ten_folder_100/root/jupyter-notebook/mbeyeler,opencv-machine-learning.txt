[Wrapping Up](notebooks/12.00-Wrapping-Up.ipynb)\n\n\n\n## Running the Code\n\nThere are at least two ways you can run the code:\n- Using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mbeyeler/opencv-machine-learning/master) (no installation required).\n- Using Jupyter Notebook on your local machine.\n\nThe code in this book was tested with Python 3.5, although Python 3.6 and 2.7 should work as well. \n\n\n### Using Binder\n\n[Binder](http://www.mybinder.org) allows you to run Jupyter notebooks in an interactive Docker container.\nNo installation required!\n\nLaunch the project: [mbeyeler/opencv-machine-learning](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mbeyeler/opencv-machine-learning/master)\n\n\n\n### Using Jupyter Notebook\n\nYou basically want to follow the installation instructions in Chapter 1 of the book.\n\nIn short:\n\n1. Download and install [Python Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).\n   On Unix, when asked if the Anaconda path should be added to your `PATH` variable, choose yes. Then either open a new terminal or run `$ source ~/.bashrc`.\n\n2. Fork and clone the GitHub repo:\n   - Click the\n     [`Fork`](https://github.com/mbeyeler/opencv-machine-learning#fork-destination-box)\n     button in the top-right corner of this page.\n   - Clone the repo, where `YourUsername` is your actual GitHub user name:\n\n   ```\n   $ git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/opencv-machine-learning\n   $ cd opencv-machine-learning\n   ```\n   \n   - Add the following to your remotes:\n   ```\n   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/mbeyeler/opencv-machine-learning\n   ```\n   \n3. Add Conda-Forge to your trusted channels (to simplify installation of OpenCV on Windows platforms):\n\n   ```\n   $ conda config --add channels conda-forge\n   ```\n\n4. Create a conda environment for Python 3 with all required packages:\n\n   ```\n   $ conda create -n Python3 python=3.6 --file requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n5. Activate the conda environment.\n   On Linux / Mac OS X:\n\n   ```\n   $ source activate Python3\n   ```\n\n   On Windows:\n\n   ```\n   $ activate Python3\n   ```\n\n   You can learn more about conda environments in the\n   [Managing Environments](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html)\n   section of the conda documentation.\n\n6. Launch Jupyter notebook:\n\n   ```\n   $ jupyter notebook\n   ```\n\n   This will open up a browser window in your current directory.\n   Navigate to the folder `opencv-machine-learning`.\n   The README file has a table of contents.\n   Else navigate to the `notebooks` folder, click on the notebook of your choice,\n   and select `Kernel > Restart & Run All` from the top menu.\n   \n   \n## Getting the latest code\n\nIf you followed the instructions above and:\n- forked the repo,\n- cloned the repo,\n- added the `upstream` remote repository,\n\nthen you can always grab the latest changes by running a git pull:\n\n```\n$ cd opencv-machine-learning\n$ git pull upstream master\n```\n\n## Errata\n\nThe following errata have been reported that apply to the print version of the book. Some of these are typos, others are bugs in the code. Please note that all known bugs have been fixed in the code of this repository.\n- p.32: `Out[15]` should read \'3\' instead of \'int_arr[3]\'.\n- p.32: `Out[22]` should read `array([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0])` instead of `array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])`.\n- p.33: In the sentence: "Here, the first dimension defines the color channel...", the order of color channels should read "blue, green, and red in OpenCV" instead of "red, green, blue, green, and red".\n- p.36: The range of x values should read "0 <= x <= 10" instead of "0 <= x < 10", since `np.linspace` by default includes the endpoint.\n- p.51: `In [15]` shoud read `precision = true_positive / (true_positive + false_positive)` instead of `precision = true_positive / (true_positive + true_negative)`.\n- p.51: `Out[15]` should read 0.2 instead of 1.0.\n- p.72: `In [6]` should read `ridgereg = linear_model.Ridge()` instead of `ridgereg = linear_model.RidgeRegression()`.\n- p.85: The first line of `In [8]` should read `min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(-10,10))` instead of `min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler(feature_range (-10,10))`.\n- p.91:  The last paragraph should read `We also specify an empty array, np.array([]), for the mean argument, which tells OpenCV to  compute the mean from the data:` instead of `We also specify an empty array, np.array([]), for the mask argument, which tells OpenCV to use all data points in the feature matrix:`.\n- p.112: `In [3]` should read `vec.get_feature_names()[:5]` instead of `function:vec.get_feature_names()[:5]`.\n- p.120: `In [16]` should read `dtree = cv2.ml.DTrees_create()` instead of `dtree = cv2.ml.dtree_create()`.\n- p.122: `In [26]` should read `with open("tree.dot", \'w\'): f = tree.export_graphviz(dtc, out_file=f, feature_names=vec.get_feature_names(), class_names=[\'A\', \'B\', \'C\', \'D\'])` instead of `with open("tree.dot", \'w\'): f = tree.export_graphviz(clf, out_file=f)`. Also, the second line should be indented.\n- p.147: The first occurrences of `X_hypo = np.c_[xx.ravel().astype(np.float32), yy.ravel().astype(np.float32)]` and `_, zz = svm.predict(X_hypo)` should be removed, as they mistakenly appear twice.\n- p.193: `In [28]` is missing `from sklearn import metrics`.\n- p.197: The sentence right below `In [3]` should read "Then we can pass the preceding data matrix (`X`) to `cv2.kmeans`", not `cv2.means`.\n- p.201: Indentation in bullet points 2-4 are wrong. Please refer to the Jupyter notebook for the correct indentation.\n- p.228: The last sentence in the middle paragraph should read "[...] thus hopefully classifying the sample as y_{hat}=+1" instead of "[...] thus hopefully classifying the sample as y_{hat}=-1".\n- p.230: `In [2]` has wrong indentation: `class Perceptron(object)` correctly has indentation level 1, but `def __init__` should have indentation level 2, and the two commands `self.lr = lr; self.n_iter = n_iter` should have indentation level 3.\n- p.260: `In [5]` should read `from keras.models import Sequential` instead of `from keras.model import Sequential`.\n- p.260: `In [6]` should read `model.add(Conv2D(n_filters, (kernel_size[0], kernel_size[1]), padding=\'valid\', input_shape=input_shape))` instead of `model.add(Convolution2D(n_filters, kernel_size[0], kernel_size[1], border_mode=\'valid\', input_shape=input_shape))`.\n- p.260: `In [8]` should read `model.add(Conv2D(n_filters, (kernel_size[0], kernel_size[1])))` instead of `model.add(Convolution2D(n_filters, (kernel_size[0], kernel_size[1])))`.\n- p.261: `In [12]` should read `model.fit(X_train, Y_train, batch_size=128, epochs=12, verbose=1, validation_data=(X_test, Y_test))` instead of `model.fit(X_train, Y_train, batch_size=128, nb_epoch=12, verbose=1, validation_data=(X_test, Y_test))`.\n- p.275, in bullet point 2 it should say `ret = classifier.predict(X_hypo)` instead of `zz = classifier.predict(X_hypo); zz = zz.reshape(xx.shape)`.\n- p.285: `plt.imshow(X[i, :].reshape((64, 64)), cmap=\'gray\')` should be indented so that it is aligned with the previous line.\n- p.288: `In [14]` should read `_, y_hat = rtree.predict(X_test)` instead of `_, y_hat = tree.predict(X_test)`.\n- p.305: The first paragraph should read "...and the remaining folds (1, 2, and 4) for training" instead of "...and the remaining folds (1, 2, and 4) for testing".\n- p.306: `In [2]` should read `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split` instead of `from sklearn.model_selection import model_selection`.\n- p.310: `In [18]` should read `knn.train(X_boot, cv2.ml.ROW_SAMPLE, y_boot)` instead of `knn.train(X_train, cv2.ml.ROW_SAMPLE, y_boot)`.\n- p.311: `In [20]` should have a line `model.train(X_boot, cv2.ml.ROW_SAMPLE, y_boot)` instead of `knn.train(X_boot, cv2.ml.ROW_SAMPLE, y_boot)`, as well as `_, y_hat = model.predict(X_oob)` instead of `_, y_hat = knn.predict(X_oob)`.\n- p.328: `In [5]` is missing the statement `from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler`.\n- p.328: `In [5]` should have a line `pipe = Pipeline([("scaler", MinMaxScaler()), ("svm", SVC())])` instead of `pipe = Pipeline(["scaler", MinMaxScaler(), ("svm", SVC())])`.\n\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nThis book was inspired in many ways by the following authors and their corresponding publications:\n- Jake VanderPlas, Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data.
