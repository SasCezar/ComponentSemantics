b'# Deprecated\nThis extension is no longer being maintained and all of its functionality has been (or will be) placed into the [Microsoft Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). \n\nPlease download the Microsoft Python Extension instead.\n\nFeel free to submit new [issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/new) or feature requests on the Microsoft Python Extension.\n\n# Jupyter\n\nAn extension with rich support for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)  \n\n## Quick Start\n* Install the extension\n* When using Python, install the [Microsoft Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) as well. \n* Install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install.html)  \n  + You\'re ready to use it.\n\n## Sample Python usage  \n* Create a Python file with the following text  \n\n```python\n#%%\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 20, 100)\nplt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\nplt.show() \n```  \n  \n* Click on the code lens ```Run Cell```\n\n## Run Cell Hot key as in Chrome\n* If you want to run cell with Ctrl+Enter, add those code in keybindings.json.\n\n```json\n{ "key": "ctrl+enter",      "command": "jupyter.execCurrentCell",\n                                  "when": "editorTextFocus"\n}\n```\n\n## Connect to Remote Jupyter kernel on Server / Docker\nTry this to connect to a remote Jupyter kernel running on a server, or inside Docker container:\n\n1. Make sure Jupyter, Notebook, and jupyter_kernel_gateway packages are installed.  They are all included by default in Anaconda installation, but if you are using PIP you may need to install them manually.\n1. Run following commands on Linux: (Windows users will need to adapt these commands for their env)\n```\n# Generate config file for KernelGateway\njupyter kernelgateway --KernelGatewayApp.generate_config=True\n\n# Generate config for Jupyter Notebook\njupyter notebook --generate-config --allow-root\n\n# Append appropriate values to both config files\necho -e "c.JupyterWebsocketPersonality.list_kernels = True" >> ~/.jupyter/jupyter_kernel_gateway_config.py\necho -e "c.NotebookApp.allow_root = True" >> ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py\n```\n1. Start a remote Jupyter Notebook or headless KernelGateway\n1. Find the token in the output of the Jupyter server logs: http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html\n\nThen in VS Code:\n1. ctrl+shift+p\n1. Jupyter: Enter the url of local/remote Jupyter Notebook\n1. Select existing kernels from the drop-down list, or start a new kernel\n1. Select language for the kernel from drop-down list: e.g., "Python 3"\n\n\n## [Documentation](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/vscodejupyter/wiki)\nFor further information and details continue through to the [documentation](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/vscodejupyter/wiki).\n\n## [Issues, Feature Requests and Contributions](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/vscodejupyter/issues)\n* Contributions are always welcome.
