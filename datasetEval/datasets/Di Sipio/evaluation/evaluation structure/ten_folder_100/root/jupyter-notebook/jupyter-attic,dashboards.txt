b"# [RETIRED] Jupyter Dashboards - Layout Extension\n\nThis project has been retired and replaced by incorporating the [Voil\xc3\xa0 ecosystem of dashboarding tools into Project Jupyter](https://github.com/voila-dashboards). See the [Jupyter blog](https://blog.jupyter.org/and-voil%C3%A0-f6a2c08a4a93) [posts](https://blog.jupyter.org/a-gallery-of-voil%C3%A0-examples-a2ce7ef99130?source=collection_home---6------10-----------------------) about Voil\xc3\xa0 and the [proposal to make Voil\xc3\xa0 part of Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals/blob/master/voila-incorporation/voila-incorporation.md) for more details. [voila-gridstack](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-gridstack) is an on-going project to support layouts created by this deprecated extension using Voil\xc3\xa0.\n\n---\n\n[![Project Status: Inactive \xe2\x80\x93 The project has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed; support/maintenance will be provided as time allows.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/inactive.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#inactive)\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/jupyter_dashboards.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/jupyter_dashboards) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jupyter/dashboards.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jupyter/dashboards) [![Google Group](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Google%20Group-lightgrey.svg)](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter)\n\n## Overview\n\nThe dashboards layout extension is an add-on for Jupyter Notebook. It lets you\narrange your notebook outputs (text, plots, widgets, ...) in grid- or\nreport-like layouts. It saves information about your layouts in your notebook\ndocument. Other people with the extension can open your notebook and view your\nlayouts.\n\n![Dashboard layout screenshot](docs/source/_static/dashboards_intro.png)\n\nFor a sample of what's possible with the dashboard layout extension, have a look at the [demo dashboard-notebooks](etc/notebooks) in this repository.\n\n## Installation\n\nDetailed installation instructions appear in the [Getting started\npage](http://jupyter-dashboards-layout.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html)\nof the project docs. Here's a quickstart using pip or conda:\n\n```bash\n# install using pip from pypi and then activate the extension\npip install jupyter_dashboards\njupyter dashboards quick-setup --sys-prefix\n\n# install using conda from conda-forge, no activation required\nconda install jupyter_dashboards -c conda-forge\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe [Development\npage](http://jupyter-dashboards-layout.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html)\nincludes information about setting up a dev environment and typical dev tasks.\n"
