Distiller provides a [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) environment for prototyping and analyzing compression algorithms, such as sparsity-inducing methods and low-precision arithmetic.\n\n#### Note on Release 0.3 - Possible BREAKING Changes\n\nAs of release 0.3, we\'ve moved some code around to enable proper packaging and installation of Distiller. In addition, we updated Distiller to support PyTorch 1.X, which might also cause older code to break due to some API changes.  \nIf updating from an earlier revision of the code, please make sure to follow the instructions in the [install](#install-the-package) section to make sure proper installation of Distiller and all dependencies.\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\n- [Highlighted features](#highlighted-features)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Clone Distiller](#clone-distiller)\n  - [Create a Python virtual environment](#create-a-python-virtual-environment)\n    - [Using virtualenv](#using-virtualenv)\n    - [Using venv](#using-venv)\n    - [Activate the environment](#activate-the-environment)\n  - [Install the package](#install-the-package)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n  - [Example invocations of the sample application](#example-invocations-of-the-sample-application)\n    - [Training-only](#training-only)\n    - [Getting parameter statistics of a sparsified model](#getting-parameter-statistics-of-a-sparsified-model)\n    - [Post-training quantization](#post-training-quantization)\n  - [Explore the sample Jupyter notebooks](#explore-the-sample-jupyter-notebooks)\n- [Set up the classification datasets](#set-up-the-classification-datasets)\n- [Running the tests](#running-the-tests)\n- [Generating the HTML documentation site](#generating-the-html-documentation-site)\n- [Built With](#built-with)\n- [Versioning](#versioning)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Community](#community)\n- [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments)\n- [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\n\n## Highlighted features\n* **Automatic Compression**\n  - [Automated Model Compression](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/distiller/blob/master/examples/auto_compression/amc) (AMC)\n* **Weight pruning**\n  - Element-wise pruning using magnitude thresholding, sensitivity thresholding, target sparsity level, and activation statistics \n* **Structured pruning**\n  - Convolution: 2D (kernel-wise), 3D (filter-wise), 4D (layer-wise), and channel-wise structured pruning.  \n  - Fully-connected: column-wise and row-wise structured pruning.\n  - Structure groups (e.g. structures of 4 filters).\n  - Structure-ranking with using weights or activations criteria (Lp-norm, APoZ, gradients, random, etc.).\n  - Support for new structures (e.g. block pruning)\n* **Control**\n  - Soft (mask on forward-pass only) and hard pruning (permanently disconnect neurons)\n  - Dual weight copies (compute loss on masked weights, but update unmasked weights)  \n  - Model thinning (AKA "network garbage removal") to permanently remove pruned neurons and connections.\n* **Schedule**\n  - Flexible scheduling of pruning, regularization, and learning rate decay (compression scheduling)\n  - One-shot and iterative pruning (and fine-tuning) are supported.\n  - Easily control what is performed each training step (e.g. greedy layer by layer pruning to full model pruning). \n  - Automatic gradual schedule (AGP) for pruning individual connections and complete structures.\n  - The compression schedule is expressed in a YAML file so that a single file captures the details of experiments.

[Clone Distiller](#clone-distiller)\n2. [Create a Python virtual environment](#create-a-python-virtual-environment)\n3. [Install the package](#install-the-package)\n\nNotes:\n- Distiller has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and with Python 3.5.\n- If you are not using a GPU, you might need to make small adjustments to the code.\n\n### Clone Distiller\nClone the Distiller code repository from github:\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/distiller.git\n```\nThe rest of the documentation that follows, assumes that you have cloned your repository to a directory called ```distiller```. <br>\n\n### Create a Python virtual environment\nWe recommend using a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv-def), but that of course, is up to you.\nThere\'s nothing special about using Distiller in a virtual environment, but we provide some instructions, for completeness.<br>\nBefore creating the virtual environment, make sure you are located in directory ```distiller```.  After creating the environment, you should see a directory called ```distiller/env```.\n<br>\n#### Using virtualenv\nIf you don\'t have virtualenv installed, you can find the installation instructions [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/).\n\nTo create the environment, execute:\n```\n$ python3 -m virtualenv env\n```\nThis creates a subdirectory named ```env``` where the python virtual environment is stored, and configures the current shell to use it as the default python environment.\n\n#### Using venv\nIf you prefer to use ```venv```, then begin by installing it:\n```\n$ sudo apt-get install python3-venv\n```\nThen create the environment:\n```\n$ python3 -m venv env\n```\nAs with virtualenv, this creates a directory called ```distiller/env```.<br>\n\n#### Activate the environment\nThe environment activation and deactivation commands for ```venv``` and ```virtualenv``` are the same.<br>\n**!NOTE: Make sure to activate the environment, before proceeding with the installation of the dependency packages:<br>**\n```\n$ source env/bin/activate\n```\n\n### Install the package\n\nFinally, install the Distiller package and its dependencies using ```pip3```:\n```\n$ cd distiller\n$ pip3 install -e .\n```\nThis installs Distiller in "development mode", meaning any changes made in the code are reflected in the environment without re-running the install command (so no need to re-install after pulling changes from the Git repository).\n\n### Required PyTorch Version\n\nDistiller is tested using the default installation of PyTorch 1.3.1, which uses CUDA 10.1. We use TorchVision version 0.4.2. These are included in Distiller\'s `requirements.txt` and will be automatically installed when installing the Distiller package as listed above.\n\nIf you do not use CUDA 10.1 in your environment, please refer to [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install the compatible build of PyTorch 1.3.1 and torchvision 0.4.2.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nYou can jump head-first into some limited examples of network compression, to get a feeling for the library without too much investment on your part.  \n\nDistiller comes with a sample application for compressing image classification DNNs, ```compress_classifier.py``` located at ```distiller/examples/classifier_compression```.\n\nWe\'ll show you how to use it for some simple use-cases, and will point you to some ready-to-go Jupyter notebooks.\n\nFor more details, there are some other resources you can refer to:\n+ [Frequently-asked questions (FAQ)](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/distiller/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions-(FAQ))\n+ [Model zoo](https://nervanasystems.github.io/distiller/model_zoo.html)\n+ [Compression scheduling](https://nervanasystems.github.io/distiller/schedule.html)\n+ [Usage](https://nervanasystems.github.io/distiller/usage.html)\n+ [Preparing a model for quantization](https://nervanasystems.github.io/distiller/prepare_model_quant.html)\n+ [Tutorial: Using Distiller to prune a PyTorch language model](https://nervanasystems.github.io/distiller/tutorial-lang_model.html)\n+ [Tutorial: Pruning Filters & Channels](https://nervanasystems.github.io/distiller/tutorial-struct_pruning.html)\n+ [Tutorial: Post-Training Quantization of a Language Model](https://nervanasystems.github.io/distiller/tutorial-lang_model_quant.html)\n+ [Tutorial: Post-Training Quantization of GNMT (translation model)](https://nervanasystems.github.io/distiller/tutorial-gnmt_quant.html)\n+ [Post-training quantization command line examples](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/distiller/blob/master/examples/quantization/post_train_quant/command_line.md)\n\n### Example invocations of the sample application\n+ [Training-only](#training-only)\n+ [Getting parameter statistics of a sparsified model](#getting-parameter-statistics-of-a-sparsified-model)\n+ [Post-training quantization](#post-training-quantization)\n\n#### Training-only\nThe following will invoke training-only (no compression) of a network named \'simplenet\' on the CIFAR10 dataset.  This is roughly based on TorchVision\'s sample Imagenet training application, so it should look familiar if you\'ve used that application.  In  this example we don\'t invoke any compression mechanisms: we just train because for fine-tuning after pruning, training is an essential part.<br>  \nNote that the first time you execute this command, the CIFAR10 code will be downloaded to your machine, which may take a bit of time - please let the download process proceed to completion.\n\nThe path to the CIFAR10 dataset is arbitrary, but in our examples we place the datasets in the same directory level as distiller (i.e. ```../../../data.cifar10```).\n\nFirst, change to the sample directory, then invoke the application:\n```\n$ cd distiller/examples/classifier_compression\n$ python3 compress_classifier.py --arch simplenet_cifar ../../../data.cifar10 -p 30 -j=1 --lr=0.01\n```\n\nYou can use a TensorBoard backend to view the training progress (in the diagram below we show a couple of training sessions with different LR values).  For compression sessions, we\'ve added tracing of activation and parameter sparsity levels, and regularization loss.\n<center> <img src="imgs/simplenet_training.png"></center>\n\n\n#### Getting parameter statistics of a sparsified model\nWe\'ve included in the git repository a few checkpoints of a ResNet20 model that we\'ve trained with 32-bit floats.  Let\'s load the checkpoint of a model that we\'ve trained with channel-wise Group Lasso regularization.<br>\nWith the following command-line arguments, the sample application loads the model (```--resume```)  and prints statistics about the model weights (```--summary=sparsity```).  This is useful if you want to load a previously pruned model, to examine the weights sparsity statistics, for example.  Note that when you *resume* a stored checkpoint, you still need to tell the application which network architecture the checkpoint uses (```-a=resnet20_cifar```):\n```\n$ python3 compress_classifier.py --resume=../ssl/checkpoints/checkpoint_trained_ch_regularized_dense.pth.tar -a=resnet20_cifar ../../../data.cifar10 --summary=sparsity\n```\n<center> <img src="imgs/ch_sparsity_stats.png"></center>\n\nYou should see a text table detailing the various sparsities of the parameter tensors.  The first column is the parameter name, followed by its shape, the number of non-zero elements (NNZ) in the dense model, and in the sparse model.  The next set of columns show the column-wise, row-wise, channel-wise, kernel-wise, filter-wise and element-wise sparsities.\n<br>\nWrapping it up are the standard-deviation, mean, and mean of absolute values of the elements.\n\nIn the [Compression Insights notebook](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/distiller/blob/master/jupyter/compression_insights.ipynb) we use matplotlib to plot a bar chart of this summary, that indeed show non-impressive footprint compression.\n\n<center> <img src="imgs/ch_sparsity_stats_barchart.png"></center>\n\n\nAlthough the memory footprint compression is very low, this model actually saves 26.6% of the MACs compute.  \n```\n$ python3 compress_classifier.py --resume=../ssl/checkpoints/checkpoint_trained_channel_regularized_resnet20_finetuned.pth.tar -a=resnet20_cifar ../../../data.cifar10 --summary=compute\n```\n<center> <img src="imgs/ch_compute_stats.png"></center>\n\n#### Post-training quantization\nThis example performs 8-bit quantization of ResNet20 for CIFAR10.  We\'ve included in the git repository the checkpoint of a ResNet20 model that we\'ve trained with 32-bit floats, so we\'ll take this model and quantize it:\n\n```\n$ python3 compress_classifier.py -a resnet20_cifar ../../../data.cifar10 --resume ../ssl/checkpoints/checkpoint_trained_dense.pth.tar --quantize-eval --evaluate\n```\n\nThe command-line above will save a checkpoint named `quantized_checkpoint.pth.tar` containing the quantized model parameters. See more examples [here](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/distiller/blob/master/examples/quantization/post_train_quant/command_line.md).\n\n### Explore the sample Jupyter notebooks\nThe set of notebooks that come with Distiller is described [here](https://nervanasystems.github.io/distiller/jupyter.html#using-the-distiller-notebooks), which also explains the steps to install the Jupyter notebook server.<br>\nAfter installing and running the server, take a look at the [notebook](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/distiller/blob/master/jupyter/sensitivity_analysis.ipynb) covering pruning sensitivity analysis.\n\nSensitivity analysis is a long process and this notebook loads CSV files that are the output of several sessions of sensitivity analysis.\n<center> <img src="imgs/resnet18-sensitivity.png"></center>\n\n## Set up the classification datasets\nThe sample application for compressing image classification DNNs, ```compress_classifier.py``` located at ```distiller/examples/classifier_compression```, uses both [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) image datasets.<br>\n\nThe ```compress_classifier.py``` application will download the CIFAR10 automatically the first time you try to use it (thanks to TorchVision).  The example invocations used  throughout Distiller\'s documentation assume that you have downloaded the images to directory ```distiller/../data.cifar10```, but you can place the images anywhere you want (you tell ```compress_classifier.py``` where the dataset is located - or where you want the application to download the dataset to - using a command-line parameter).\n\nImageNet needs to be [downloaded](http://image-net.org/download) manually, due to copyright issues.  Facebook has created a [set of scripts](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch/blob/master/INSTALL.md#download-the-imagenet-dataset) to help download and extract the dataset.\n\nAgain, the Distiller documentation assumes the following directory structure for the datasets, but this is just a suggestion:\n```\ndistiller\n  examples\n    classifier_compression\ndata.imagenet/\n    train/\n    val/\ndata.cifar10/\n    cifar-10-batches-py/\n        batches.meta\n        data_batch_1\n        data_batch_2\n        data_batch_3\n        data_batch_4\n        data_batch_5\n        readme.html\n        test_batch\n```\n\n\n## Running the tests\nWe are currently light-weight on test and this is an area where contributions will be much appreciated.<br>\nThere are two types of tests: system tests and unit-tests.  To invoke the unit tests:\n```\n$ cd distiller/tests\n$ pytest\n```\n\nWe use CIFAR10 for the system tests, because its size makes for quicker tests.  To invoke the system tests, you need to provide a path to the CIFAR10 dataset which you\'ve already downloaded.  Alternatively, you may invoke ```full_flow_tests.py``` without specifying the location of the CIFAR10 dataset and let the test download the dataset (for the first invocation only).  Note that ```--cifar1o-path``` defaults to the current directory. <br>\nThe system tests are not short, and are even longer if the test needs to download the dataset.  \n\n```\n$ cd distiller/tests\n$ python full_flow_tests.py --cifar10-path=<some_path>\n```\n\nThe script exits with status 0 if all tests are successful, or status 1 otherwise.\n\n## Generating the HTML documentation site\nInstall mkdocs and the required packages by executing:\n\n```\n$ pip3 install -r doc-requirements.txt\n```\n\nTo build the project documentation run:\n```\n$ cd distiller/docs-src\n$ mkdocs build --clean\n```\nThis will create a folder named \'site\' which contains the documentation website.\nOpen distiller/docs/site/index.html to view the documentation home page.\n\n## Built With\n\n* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) - The tensor and neural network framework used by Distiller.\n* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) - Notebook serving.\n* [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard) - Used to view training graphs.\n* [Cadene](https://github.com/Cadene/pretrained-models.pytorch) - Pretrained PyTorch models.\n\n## Versioning\n\nWe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
