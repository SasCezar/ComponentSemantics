Make Deep Learning easier (minimal code).\n2. Minimise required mathematics.\n3. Make it practical (runs on laptops).\n4. Open Source Deep Learning Learning.\n5. Grow a collaborating practical community around DL.\n6. Memes: No seriously. Make DL fun and interactive, this means more Trump tweets.\n\n## Support Us\nThere\'s a few ways you can support this initiative:\n1. Right now this is very much a self funded project. If you wish to see more and more high quality tutorials and videos support us at: https://www.patreon.com/deepschoolio\n2. Subscribe to our [YouTube channel here](http://www.youtube.com/user/sachinabey?sub_confirmation=1).\n3. Star this repository and share it!\n\n## Contents\nThe following contents are each contained within a folder:\n1. Data Science (eg. Pandas)\n2. Deep Learning (Keras)\n3. Bayesian Learning (PyMC3)\n\n## Installation\nWe run all our notebooks on google colab. In order to do this:\n1. Get a google account.\n2. Click on this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L9BPDSm6Y4jbljf5IsI102zgW49wNGem) to take you to the google Drive folder.\n3. Go to the DL-Keras folder (or any other topic that you wish to learn).\n4. Double click on the notebook and click on, \'open with colaboratory\' (You need to haved signed into Google for this).\n5. Click on the \'Runtime\' tab at the top and change to python3 and GPU. Now you are all good to go.\n\n## Meetup\nFirst meetup node:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/DeepSchool-io/\n\n## YouTube playlist\nFind the corresponding video tutorial here (not all notebooks have an associated video)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIx9QCwIhuRS1SPS9LHF7VjvZyM1g2Swz\n\nYou can ask questions and join the development discussion:\n- On the DeepSchool-io Slack channel.
