Inspired by Jupyter Kernel Gateway, Jupyter Enterprise Gateway provides feature parity with Kernel Gateway's [jupyter-websocket mode](https://jupyter-kernel-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/websocket-mode.html) in addition to the following:\n* Adds support for remote kernels hosted throughout the enterprise where kernels can be launched in \nthe following ways:\n    * Local to the Enterprise Gateway server (today's Kernel Gateway behavior)\n    * On specific nodes of the cluster utilizing a round-robin algorithm\n    * On nodes identified by an associated resource manager\n* Provides support for Apache Spark managed by YARN, IBM Spectrum Conductor, Kubernetes or Docker Swarm out of the box.   Others can be configured via Enterprise Gateway's extensible framework.\n* Secure communication from the client, through the Enterprise Gateway server, to the kernels\n* Multi-tenant capabilities\n* Persistent kernel sessions\n* Ability to associate profiles consisting of configuration settings to a kernel for a given user (see [Project Roadmap](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/roadmap.html))\n\n![Deployment Diagram](https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/blob/master/docs/source/images/deployment.png?raw=true)\n\n## Features\n\nSee [Enterprise Gateway Features](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#enterprise-gateway-features) in the \ndocumentation for a list of Jupyter Enterprise Gateway features.\n\n## Installation\n\nDetailed installation instructions are located in the \n[Getting Started page](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html)\nof the project docs. Here's a quick start using `pip`:\n\n```bash\n# install from pypi\npip install --upgrade jupyter_enterprise_gateway\n\n# show all config options\njupyter enterprisegateway --help-all\n\n# run it with default options\njupyter enterprisegateway\n```\n\nPlease check the [Configuration Options page](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config-options.html) \nfor information about the supported options.\n\n## System Architecture\n\nThe [System Architecture page](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system-architecture.html) \nincludes information about Enterprise Gateway's remote kernel, process proxy, and launcher frameworks.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe [Contribution page](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contrib.html) includes \ninformation about how to contribute to Enterprise Gateway along with our roadmap.  While there, you'll want to\n[set up a development environment](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devinstall.html) and check out typical developer tasks.\n\n"
