b"sms-tools\n========= \n\n\nSound analysis/synthesis tools for music applications written in python (with a bit of C) plus complementary teaching materials.\n\nHow to use\n----------\n\nIn order to use these tools you have to install python (recommended 3.7.x) and the following modules: ipython, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and cython. \n\nIn Ubuntu (which we strongly recommend) in order to install all these modules it is as simple as typing in the Terminal:\n\n<code>$ sudo apt-get install python-dev ipython python-numpy python-matplotlib python-scipy cython</code>\n\nIn OSX (which we do not support but that should work) you install these modules by typing in the Terminal:\n\n<code>$ pip install ipython numpy matplotlib scipy cython</code>\n\nthen, for using the tools, after downloading the whole package, you need to compile some C functions. For that you should go to the directory <code>software/models/utilFunctions_C</code> and type:</p>\n\n<code>$ python compileModule.py build_ext --inplace </code>\n\nThe basic sound analysis/synthesis functions, or models, are in the directory <code>software/models</code> and there is a graphical interface and individual example functions in <code>software/models_interface</code>. To execute the models GUI you have to go to the directory <code>software/models_interface</code> and type: \n\n<code>$ python models_GUI.py </code>\n\nTo execute the transformations GUI that calls various sound transformation functions go to the directory <code>software/transformations_interface</code> and type: \n\n<code>$ python transformations_GUI.py </code>\n\nTo modify the existing code, or to create your own using some of the functions, we recommend to use the <code>workspace</code> directory. Typically you would copy a file from <code>software/models_interface</code> or from <code>software/transformations_interface</code> to that directory, modify the code, and execute it from there (you will have to change some of the paths inside the files). \n\nJupyter Notebook instructions\n-------\n\nInstall Jupyter Notebook according to it's instructions https://jupyter.org/install\n\nStart up jupyter notebook\n\n<code>$ jupyter notebook</code> \n\nFollow instructions appearing in the console regarding navigating your browser to the notebook\n\nContent\n-------\n\nAll the code is in the <code> software </code> directory, with subdirectories for the models, the transformations, and the interfaces. The lecture materials are in the <code>lectures</code> directory, the assignments related to the lectures in the  <code>assignments</code> directory, and the sounds used for the examples and coming from <code>http://freesound.org</code> are in the <code>sounds</code> directory.\n\nLicense\n-------\nAll the software is distributed with the Affero GPL license (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html), the lecture slides are distributed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) and the sounds in this repository are released under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\n"
