b"BTCPool for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Decred, Bytom, ...\n==================\n\n|Branch|Status|\n|------|------|\n|master|[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/btccom/btcpool/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/btccom/btcpool/tree/master)|\n|deveth|[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/btccom/btcpool/tree/deveth.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/btccom/btcpool/tree/deveth)|\n\nBTCPool is backend system of [https://pool.btc.com](https://pool.btc.com).\n\n> This is a version of BTCPool that supports more blockchains. Check the **SHA256-only** version at [master](https://github.com/btccom/btcpool/tree/master) branch.\n\nThe pool backend support these blockchains at current:\n* SHA256\n   * [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/)\n   * [BitcoinCash](https://bitcoincash.org/)\n   * [UnitedBitcoin](https://ub.com/)\n   * ~~[SuperBitcoin](http://supersmartbitcoin.com/)~~ (outdated and unmaintained)\n* Scrypt\n   * [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/)\n* ETHash / Daggerhashimoto\n   * [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)\n   * [Ethereum Classic](https://ethereumclassic.org/)\n* EquiHash\n   * [ZCash](https://z.cash/)\n   * [Beam](https://www.beam.mw/)\n   > Tips: ZCash and BEAM use different EquiHash parameters and are not compatible in mining.\n* Cuckoo Cycle\n   * [Grin](https://grin-tech.org/)\n   > Tips: Grin supports `Cuckaroo Cycle 29` and `Cuckatoo Cycle 31` at the same time, miners can choose an algorithm to mine.\n* Blake-256\n   * [Decred](https://www.decred.org/)\n* Tensority\n   * [Bytom](https://bytom.io/)\n* Eaglesong\n   * [Ckb](https://www.nervos.org/) (finished but the test is not enough)\n   > Tips: only Tested with bminer and nbminer. need to be updated after the new version of ckb is released. \n* Others\n   * ~~[Siacoin](https://www.sia.tech/)~~ (not finished and need test)\n\nIt also support these merged mining blockchains of SHA256 blockchains:\n* SHA256 merged mining\n   * [Namecoin](https://www.namecoin.org/)\n   * [RSK](https://www.rsk.co/)\n   * [ElastOS](https://elastos.org/)\n   * Other blockchains that compatible with [Bitcoin merged mining specification](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification)\n   \nIf you want merged mine more than one chains that compatible with [Bitcoin merged mining specification](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification), use [merged mining proxy](https://github.com/btccom/btcpool-go-modules/tree/master/mergedMiningProxy).\n\nNote: The project is still a testbed and work in progress, all things could be changed.\n\nSee Also:\n* [BTCPool's golang modules](https://github.com/btccom/btcpool-go-modules)\n\n## Architecture (need update)\n\n![Architecture](docs/btcpool.png)\n\n## Install\n\n1. Install `Zookeeper`, or see [INSTALL-ZooKeeper.md](docs/INSTALL-ZooKeeper.md)\n  * [https://zookeeper.apache.org/](https://zookeeper.apache.org/)\n2. Install `Kafka`, or see [INSTALL-Kafka.md](docs/INSTALL-Kafka.md)\n  * [https://kafka.apache.org/](https://kafka.apache.org/)\n3. Install `BTCPool`, see [INSTALL-BTCPool.md](docs/INSTALL-BTCPool.md)\n\n## Upgrade\n\nUpgrading to BTCPool 2.3.0 requires additional operations on `sharelogger`, `slparser` and `statshttpd` due to incompatible sharelog format changes.\n\nSee [UPGRADE-BTCPool.md](docs/UPGRADE-BTCPool.md) for more information.\n\n## Benchmark (outdated)\n\nWe have test 100,000 miners online Benchmark. see [Benchmark-100000.md](docs/Benchmark-100000.md)\n\n## BTCAgent\n\nBTCAgent is a kind of stratum proxy which use customize protocol to communicate with the pool. It's very efficient and designed for huge mining farm.\n\n* [AGENT.md](docs/AGENT.md)\n* BTCAgent's [HomePage](https://github.com/btccom/BTCAgent)\n\n## Testing\n\nYou could run `simulator` to test the system. It will simulate a lots of miners, need to enbale config `enable_simulator` on your Stratum Server.\n\n## License\nBTCPool is released under the terms of the MIT license.
