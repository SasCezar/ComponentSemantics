Download the latest RELEASE (.zip package) from https://github.com/MultiPoolMiner/MultiPoolMiner/releases\n2. Extract it to your Desktop (MultiPoolMiner will NOT work from folders such as "C:\\Program Files\\")\n3. Make sure you have all pre-requisites installed/updated from the IMPORTANT NOTES section below.\n4. Right-click on the (required) Start.bat file and open it with a Notepad application. Multiple start.bat files are included as examples.\n5. Edit the Start.bat file with your details (such as YOUR username, wallet address, region, worker name, device type). New users should NOT edit anything else. Please see COMMAND LINE OPTIONS below for specification and further details.\n6. Save and close the Start.bat file you just edited.\n7. Launch the Start.bat file you just edited.\n8. Let the benchmarking finish (you will be earning shares even during benchmarking).\n9. Optional: Download, install and configure HWiNFO64, this is required if you want to make power usage a part of the profit calculation. See ConfigHWinfo64.pdf for details.\n\nDone. You are all set to mine the most profitable coins and maximise your profits using MultiPoolMiner.\n\n\n\n## IMPORTANT NOTES\n\n- It is not recommended but to upgrade from a previous version of MultiPoolMiner, you may simply copy the \'Stats\' folder.\n- Having PowerShell 6.2 installed is now a requirement. [Windows 64bit](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v6.2.1/PowerShell-6.2.1-win-x64.msi), [All other versions](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 or later is required for MultiPoolMiner to function properly. [Web Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773)\n- CCMiner (NVIDIA cards only) may need \'MSVCR120.dll\' if you don\'t already have it: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784. Make sure that you install both the x86 and the x64 versions. \n- CCMiner (NVIDIA cards only) may need \'VCRUNTIME140.DLL\' if you don\'t already have it: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145. Make sure that you install both the x86 and the x64 versions. \n- It is highly recommended to set Virtual Memory size in Windows to at least 16 GB in multi-GPU systems: Computer Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Performance -> Advanced -> Virtual Memory\n- Please see the FAQ section on the bottom of this page before submitting bugs and feature requests on Github. https://github.com/MultiPoolMiner/MultiPoolMiner/issues \n- Logs and Stats are produced in text format; use them when submitting issues.\n- Currently mining with up to 6 GPUs is fully supported. Where required advanced users can create additional or amend current miner files to support mining with more than 6 graphics cards.\n\n\t\n\n## COMMAND LINE OPTIONS\n###### (case-insensitive - except for wallet addresses (e.g. BTC), see *Sample Usage* section below for an example)\nListed in alphabetical order. Note: For basic operation not all parameters must be defined through start.bat.\n\n**-AllowedBadShareRatio**\nAllowed ratio of bad shares (total / bad) as reported by the miner. If the ratio exceeds the configured threshold then the miner will marked as failed. Allowed values: 0.00 - 1.00. Default of 0 disables this check\n\n**-API_Key**\nRequired only if you are mining at MiningPoolHub. Adding this parameter / key pair allows MPM to gather the balances at the pool. \nThe API_Key can be found in the MiningPoolHub Account detail page.\n\n**-APIPort**\nPort for the MPM API and web GUI. The miner port range will start from APIPort +1. Default is 3999. 0 disables the API.\n\n**-Algorithm**\nSupported algorithms sorted by pool can be found at https://multipoolminer.io/algorithms. Use commas to separate multiple values.\n\nThe following algorithms are currently supported:\n\n    Bitcore, Blakecoin, Blake2s, BlakeVanilla, C11, CryptoNightV7, CryptoNightHeavy, Ethash, X11, Decred, Equihash, Groestl, HMQ1725, HSR, JHA, Keccak, Lbry, Lyra2RE2, Lyra2z, MyriadGroestl, NeoScrypt, Pascal, Phi, Phi2, Phi1612, Polytimos, Quark, Qubit, Scrypt, SHA256, Sib, Skunk, Skein, Timetravel, Tribus, Veltor, X11, X12, X11evo, X16R, X16S, X17, Yescrypt\n\n*Note that the list of supported algorithms can change depending on the capabilities of the supported miner binaries. Some algos are now being mined with ASICs and are no longer profitable when mined with CPU/GPU and will get removed from MPM.\n\n#### Special parameters: \n- **Ethash2gb** - can be profitable for older GPUs that have 2GB or less GDDR memory. It includes ethash coins that have a DAG file size of less than 2GB (and will be mined when most profitable). Ethereum and a few other coins have surpassed this size therefore cannot be mined with older cards.\n- **ethash3gb** - can be profitable for older GPUs that have 3GB or less GDDR memory. It includes ethash coins that have a DAG file size of less than 3GB (and will be mined when most profitable). Ethereum and a few other coins have surpassed this size therefore cannot be mined with older cards.\n- **decrednicehash** - if you want to include non-dual, non-Claymore Decred mining on Nicehash. NiceHash created their own implementation of Decred mining protocol.\n\n*Note that the pool selected also needs to support the required algorithm(s) or your specified pool (-PoolName) will be ignored when mining certain algorithms. The *-Algorithm* command is higher in execution hierarchy and can override pool selection. This feature comes handy when you mine on Zpool but also want to mine ethash coins (which is not supported by Zpool). **WARNING!** If you add all algorithms listed above, you may find your earnings spread across multiple pools regardless what pool(s) you specified with the *-PoolName* command.*\n\n**-BasePowerUsage**\nAdditional base power usage (in Watt) for running the computer, monitor etc. regardless of mining hardware. Allowed values: 0.0 - 999, default is 0\n\n**-BenchmarkInterval**\nMultiPoolMiner\'s update interval in seconds during benchmarks / power metering. This is a universal timer for running the entire script (downloading/processing APIs, calculation etc). It determines how long a benchmark is run for each miner file (miner/algorithm/coin). Default is 60.\nNote: This value correlates with *-MinHashRateSamples*. If you set *-MinHashRateSamples* too high, then MPM cannot get enough samples for reliable measurement (recommendation: 10 or more). In this case increase the benchmark interval length.\n\n**-CoinName [Zcash, ZeroCoin etc.]**\nLimit mining to the listed coins only; this is also a per-pool setting (see Advanced Configuration). Use commas to separate multiple values.\nNote: Only the pools ending in ...-Coin expose all coin names in their API. Check the web dashboard / pools to see which pools expose which values.\n\n**-ConfigFile [Path\\ConfigFile.txt]**\nThe default config file name is \'.\\Config.txt\'\nIf the config file does not exist MPM will create a config file with default values. If the file name does not have an extension MPM will add .txt file name extension.\nBy default MPM will use the values from the command line. If you hardcode config values directly in the config file, then these values will override the command line parameters (see Advanced Configuration).\n\n**-Currency [BTC, USD, EUR, GBP, ETH ...]**\nChoose the default currency or currencies your profit stats will be shown in. Use commas to separate multiple values.\nImportant: MultiPoolMiner will use the first currency in the list as main currency. All profit / earning numbers will be displayed in the main (=first in the list) currency.\nNote: Instead af BTC you can also use mBTC (= BTC / 1000).\n\n**-CurrencySymbol [BTC, LTC, ZEC etc.]**\nLimit mining to the listed currency only; this is also a per-pool setting (see Advanced Configuration). Use commas to separate multiple values.\nNote: Only the pools ending in ...-Coin expose all currency symbols in their API. Check the web dashboard / pools to see which pools expose which values.\n\n**-Dashboard**\nLaunch web dashboard after MPM start.\n\n**-Delay**\nSpecify the number of seconds required to pass before opening each miner. It is useful when cards are more sensitive to switching and need some extra time to recover (eg. clear DAG files from memory)\n\n**-DeviceName**\nChoose the relevant GPU(s) and/or CPU mining.  [CPU, GPU, GPU#02, AMD, NVIDIA, AMD#02, OpenCL#03#02 etc.]. Use commas to separate multiple values.\n\n**-DisableDevFeeMining**\nDisable miner developer fees (Note: not all miners support turning off their built in fees, others will reduce the hashrate).\nThis is also a per-miner setting (see Advanced Configuration).\n\n**-DisableDeviceDetection**\nAll miner by default create separate instances for each card model.\nTo disable add *-DisableDeviceDetection* to your start batch file. This decreases profit.\nNote: Changing this parameter this will trigger some benchmarking.\n\n**-DisableEstimateCorrection**\nSome pools overestimate the projected profits.\nBy default MPM will reduce the projected algo price by a correction factor (actual_last24h / estimate_last24h) to counter pool the overestimated prices.\nNote: Not all pools include the information required for this to work in their API (currently know are MiningPoolHub & Nicehash). For these pools this setting is ignored.\nThis is also a per-miner setting (see Advanced Configuration).\n\n**-DisableMinersWithDevFee**\nUse only miners that do not have a dev fee built in.\n\n**-Donate**\nDonation of mining time in minutes per day to aaronsace. Default is 24, minimum is 10 minutes per day (less than 0.7% fee). If Interval is set higher than the donation time, the interval will prime. The downloaded miner software can have their own donation system built in. Check the readme file of the respective miner used for more details.\n\n**-ExcludeAlgorithm**\nSimilar to the *-Algorithm* command but it is used to *exclude* unwanted algorithms. Supported algorithms sorted by pool can be found at https://multipoolminer.io/algorithms. Use commas to separate multiple values.\nThis is also a per-pool setting (see Advanced Configuration).\n\n**-ExcludeCoinName [Zcash, ZeroCoin etc.]**\nSimilar to the *-CoinName* command but it is used to exclude selected coins from being mined. Use commas to separate multiple values.\nThis is also a per-pool setting (see Advanced Configuration).\nNote: Only the pools ending in ...-Coin expose all coin names in their API. Check the web dashboard / pools to see which pools expose which values.\n\n**-ExcludeCurrencySymbol [DGB, LTC, ZEC etc.]**\nSimilar to the *-CurrencySymbol* command but it is used to exclude selected currency symbols from being mined. Use commas to separate multiple values.\nThis is also a per-pool setting (see Advanced Configuration).\nNote: Only the pools ending in ...-Coin expose all currency symbols in their API. Check the web dashboard / pools to see which pools expose which values.\n\n**-ExcludeDeviceName**\nSimilar to the *-DeviceName* command but it is used to *exclude* unwanted devices for mining. [CPU, GPU, GPU#02, AMD, NVIDIA, AMD#02, OpenCL#03#02 etc.]. Use commas to separate multiple values.\n\n**-ExcludeMinerName**\nSimilar to the *-MinerName* command but it is used to *exclude* certain miners you don\'t want to use. This is useful if a miner is causing issues with your machine. Use commas to separate multiple values.\nImportant: Newer miners, e.g. ClaymoreEthash create several child-miner names, e.g. ClaymoreEthash-GPU#01-Pascal-40. These can also be used with *-ExcludeMinerName*.\nThe parameter value(s) can be in one of the 3 forms: MinerBaseName e.g. \'TeamRed\', MinerBaseName-Version, e.g. \'TeamRed-v0.5.6\' or MinerName, e.g. \'TeamRed-v0.5.6-1xEllesmere8GB\'. Use commas to separate multiple values.\n\n**-ExcludePoolName**\nSimilar to the *-PoolName* command but it is used to exclude unwanted mining pools. Use commas to separate multiple values.\n\n**-MinHashRateSamples**\nMinimum number of hashrate samples MPM will collect during benchmark per interval (higher numbers produce more exact numbers, but might prolong benchmaking). Allowed values: 10 - 99 (default is 10)\nNote: This value correlates with *-BenchmarkInterval*. If MPM cannot get the minimum valid has rate samples during the configured interval, it will automatically extend the interval to up to 3x the interval length.\n\n**-HashRateSamplesPerInterval**\nApproximate number of hashrate samples that MPM tries to collect per interval (higher numbers produce more exact numbers, but use more CPU cycles and memory). Allowed values: 5 - 20\nNote: This value correlates with *-Interval*. If you set *-Interval* too short, then MPM  cannot get enough samples for reliable measurement (recommendation: 10 or more). In this case increase the interval length.\n    \n**-HWiNFO64_SensorMapping**\nCustom HWiNFO64 sensor mapping, only required when $MeasurePowerUsage is $true, see ConfigHWinfo64.pdf\nNote: This requires advanced configuration steps (see ConfigHWinfo64.pdf)\n\n**-IgnoreFees**\nBeginning with version 3.1.0 MPM makes miner and pool fees part of the profitability calculation. This will lead to somewhat lower, but more accurate profit estimates.\nInclude this command to ignore miner and pool fees (as older versions did)\n\n**-IgnorePowerCost**\nInclude this command to ignore the power costs when calculating profit. MPM will use the miner(s) that create the highest earning regardless of the power cost, so the resulting profit may be lower.\n\n**-Interval**\nMultiPoolMiner\'s update interval in seconds. This is an universal timer for running the entire script (downloading/processing APIs, calculation etc). It also determines how long a benchmark is run for each miner file (miner/algorithm/coin). Default is 60.\nNote: This value correlates with *-MinHashRateSamples*. If you set *-MinHashRateSamples* too short, then MPM cannot get enough samples for reliable measurement (anything over 10 is fine). In this case increase the interval length.\n\n**-IntervalMultiplier**\nInterval multiplier per algorithm during benchmarking, if an algorithm is not listed the default of 1 is used.\nThe default values are @{"EquihashR15053" = 2; "Mtp" = 2; "MtpNicehash" = 2; "ProgPow" = 2; "Rfv2" = 2; "X16r" = 5; "X16Rt" = 3; "X16RtGin" = 3; "X16RtVeil" = 3}\nNote: The default values can be overwritten by specifying other values in the config file (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n\n**-MeasurePowerUsage**\nInclude this command to to gather power usage per device. This is a pre-requisite to calculate power costs and effective earnings. \nNote: This requires advanced configuration steps (see ConfigHWinfo64.pdf)\n\n**-MinAccuracy**\nOnly pools with price accuracy greater than the configured value. Allowed values: 0 - 1 (default is 0.5 = 50%)\nSometimes pools report erroneously high price spikes, just to self-correct after a few intervals. A value of 0.5 will ignore any princing information with a margin of error greater than 50%.\n\n**-MinerName**\nSpecify to only include (restrict to) certain miner applications.\nThe parameter value(s) can be in one of the 3 forms: MinerBaseName e.g. \'TeamRed\', MinerBaseName-Version, e.g. \'TeamRed-v0.5.6\' or MinerName, e.g. \'TeamRed-v0.5.6-1xEllesmere8GB\'. Use commas to separate multiple values.\n\n**-MinerstatusKey**\nBy default the MPM monitor uses the BTC address (\'-Wallet\') to identify your mining machine (rig). Use -MinerstatusKey [your-miner-status-key] to anonymize your rig. To get your minerstatuskey goto to https://multipoolminer.io/monitor\n\n**-MinerstatusURL** https://multipoolminer.io/monitor/miner.php\nReport and monitor your mining rig\'s status by including the command above. Wallet address must be set even if you are only using MiningPoolHub as a pool. You can access the reported information by entering your wallet address on the https://multipoolminer.io/monitor web address. By using this service you understand and accept the terms and conditions detailed in this document (further below). \n\n**-MinWorker**\nMinimum numner of workers at the pool required to mine on algo / coin, if less skip the algo / coin, there is little point in mining an algo or coin if there are only very few miners working on it, default: {"\\*": = 10}, to always mine all coins set to 0.\nWildcards (* and ?) for the algorithm names are supported. If an algorithm name/wildcard matches more than one entry then the lower number takes priority.\nThis is also a per-pool setting (see Advanced Configuration).\n\n**-PoolBalancesUpdateInterval**\nMPM queries the pool balances every n minutes. Default is 15, minimum is 0 (=on every loop). MPM does this to minimize the requests sent to the pools. Pools usually do not update the balances in real time, so querying on each loop is unnecessary.\nNote: The balance overview is still shown on each loop.\n    \n**-Poolname [ahashpool[-algo / -coin], blazepool[-algo / -coin], blockmasters[-algo / -coin], hashrefinery[-algo / -coin], miningpoolhub[-algo / -coin], nicehash(old), nlpool[-algo / -coin], phiphipool (deprecated), ravenminer, zergpool[-algo / -coin], zpool[-algo / -coin]]**\nThe following pools are currently supported (in alphabetical order); use commas to separate multiple values:\n\n\t- AHashPool-Algo / AHashPool-Coin https://www.ahashpool.com/\n\n\t  Payout in BTC (Bitcoin address must be provided using the *-Wallet* command)\n\n\t  AHashPool-Coin allows mining selected coins only, e.g mine only ZClassic (Advanced configuration via config. file required, see below).\n\n\t- BlazePool-Algo / BlazePool-Coin http://www.blazepool.com/\n\n\t  Payout in BTC (Bitcoin address must be provided using the *-Wallet* command)\n\n\t  BlazePool-Coin allows mining selected coins only, e.g mine only ZClassic (Advanced configuration via config. file required, see below).\n\n\t- BlockMasters-Algo / BlockMasters-Coin http://www.blockmasters.co/\n\n\t  Payout in BTC (Bitcoin address must be provided using the -wallet command, see below), or any currency available in API (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n\t  \n\t  BlockMasters-Coin allows mining selected coins only, e.g mine only ZClassic (Advanced configuration via Config.txt required, see below).\n\n\t- HashRefinery-Algo / HashRefinery-Coin http://pool.hashrefinery.com\n\n\t  Payout in BTC (Bitcoin address must be provided using the *-Wallet* command)\n\n\t  HashRefinery-Coin allows mining selected coins only, e.g mine only ZClassic (Advanced configuration via config. file required, see below).\n\n\t- MiningPoolHub-Algo / MiningPooHub-Coin https://miningpoolhub.com/\n\n\t  - \'miningpoolhub-algo\' parameter uses the 17xxx ports therefore allows the pool to decide on which coin is mined of a specific algorithm\n\t  - \'miningpoolhub-coin\' allows for MultiPoolMiner to calculate and determine what is mined from all of the available coins (20xxx ports). \n\t  Usage of the \'miningpoolhub\' parameter is recommended as the pool have internal rules against switching before a block is found therefore prevents its users losing shares submitted due to early switching. A registered account is required when mining on MiningPoolHub (username must be provided using the *-Username* command).\n\t  \n\t  Payout in BTC (Bitcoin address must be provided using the *-Wallet* command), or any currency available in API (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n\t  \n\t  MiningPooHub-Coin allows mining selected coins only, e.g mine only ZClassic (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n\n\t- Nicehash(old) https://www.nicehash.com / https://old.nicehash.com\n\n\t  Payout in BTC (Bitcoin address must be provided using the *-Wallet* command) or BCH, ETX, LTC, XRP or AND ZEC (currency must be provided in config file (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n\n\t- NLPool https://www.nlpool.nl/\n\n\t  Payout in BTC (Bitcoin address must be provided using the -wallet command, see below), LTC or any currency available in API (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n\n\t- PhiPhiPool https://www.phi-phi-pool.com/ (Deprecated)\n\n\t  Note: PhiPhiPool no longer offers auto-conversion to BTC. Do NOT mine with a BTC address.\n          A separate wallet address for each mined currency must be provided in config file (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n      \n\t- Ravenminer https://ravenminer.com\n\n\t  Payout in RVN. A separate RVN wallet address must be provided in config file (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n\t  \n\t- ZergPool-Algo / ZergPool-coin http://zergpool.eu\n\n\t  Payout in BTC (Bitcoin address must be provided using the *-Wallet* command), or any currency available in API (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n \n\t  ZergPool-Coin allows mining selected coins only, e.g mine only ZClassic (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n\n\t- Zpool-Algo / Zpool-Coin http://www.zpool.ca/\n\n\t  Payout in BTC (Bitcoin address must be provided using the *-Wallet* command), or any currency available in API (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n\n\t  Zpool-Coin allows mining selected coins only, e.g mine only ZClassic (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n\n\t***IMPORTANT**: For the list of default configured pools consult \'start.bat.\' This does not rule out other pools to be included. Selecting multiple pools is allowed and will be used on a failover basis OR if first specified pool does not support that algorithm/coin. See the *-Algorithm* command for further details and example.*\n\n**-PowerPrices**\nPower price per kW\xc2\xb7h, set value for each time frame, e.g. {"00:00"=0.3;"06:30"=0.6;"18:30"=0.3}, 24hr format!\n\n**-PricePenaltyFactor**\nDefault factor with which MPM multiplies the prices reported by ALL pools. The default value is 1 (valid range is from 0.1 to 1.0). \nE.g. If you feel that the general profit estimations as reported by MPM are too high, e.g. %20, then set *-PricePenaltyFactor* to 0.8. \nThis is also settable per pool (see advanced configuration below). The value set on the pool level will override this general setting.\n\n**-ProfitabilityThreshold = 0**\nMinimum profit (in $Currency[0]) that must be made otherwise all mining will stop, set to 0 to allow mining even when making losses. Allowed values: 0.0 - 999, default is 0\n\n**-Proxy**\nSpecify your proxy address if applicable, i.e http://192.0.0.1:8080\n\n**-Region [Europe/US/Asia]**\nChoose your region or the region closest to you.\n\n**-ReportStatusInterval**\nSeconds until next miner status update (https://multipoolminer.io/monitor). Allowed values 30 - 300. Set to 0 to disable status reporting.\n\n**-ShowAllMiners** (replaces \'-UseFastestMinerPerAlgoOnly\' as used in versions before 3.3.0)\nInclude this command to list all available miners per algo and device index in the summary screen.\nBy default, if there are several miners available to mine the same algo, only the most profitable of them will be listed in the summary screen. \nNote: In benchmark mode ALL available miners wil be listed\n\n**-ShowAllPoolBalances**\nInclude this command to display the balances of all pools (including those that are excluded with *-ExcludeMinerName*) on the summary screen and in the web GUI. \n\n**-ShowMinerWindow**\nInclude this command to show the running miner windows (minimized).\nBy default MPM hides most miner windows as to not steal focus (Miners of API type \'Wrapper\' will remain hidden). Hidden miners write their output to files in the Log folder.\n\n**-ShowPowerUsage**\nInclude this command to show power usage in miner overview list\nNote: This requires advanced configuration steps (see ConfigHWinfo64.pdf)\n\n**-SingleAlgoMining**\nTo prevent dual algorithm mining, add *-SingleAlgoMining* to your start batch file.\n\n**-SSL**\nSpecifying the *-SSL* command (without a boolean value of true or false) will restrict the miner application list to include only the miners that support secure connection.\n\n**-SwitchingPrevention**\nSince version 2.6, the delta value (integer) that was used to determine how often MultiPoolMiner is allowed to switch, is now user-configurable on a scale of 1 to infinity on an intensity basis. Default is 1 (Start.bat default is 2). Recommended values are 1-10 where 1 means the most frequent switching and 10 means the least switching. Please note setting this value to zero (0) will not turn this function off! Please see further explanation in MULTIPOOLMINER\'S LOGIC section below. \n\n**-UserName**\nYour username you use to login to MiningPoolHub.\n\n**-Wallet**\nYour Bitcoin payout address. Required when mining on AhashPool, BlazePool, Hash Refinery, Nicehash and Zpool (unless you have defined another payout currency (Advanced configuration via config file required, see below).\n\n**-WarmupTime**\nTime a miner is allowed to warm up before it could get marked as failed, e.g. to compile the binaries or to get the API ready. Default is 30 (seconds).\n\n**-Watchdog**\nInclude this command to enable the watchdog feature which detects and handles miner and other related failures.\nIt works on a unified interval that is defaulted to 60 seconds. Watchdog timers expire if three of those intervals pass without being kicked. There are three stages as to what action is taken when watchdog timers expire and is determined by the number of related expired timers.\n- Stage 1: when 1 timer expires relating to one miner/algorithm combination, the one miner/algorithm combination is kicked\n- Stage 2: when 2 timers expire relating to one miner file, the one miner file is kicked\n- Stage 3: when 3 timers expire relating to one pool, the pool is kicked\n\nWatchdog timers reset after three times the number of seconds it takes to get to stage 3.\n\n**-WorkerName**\nTo identify your mining rig.\n\n\n\n## SAMPLE USAGE\n\n---------- (check "start.bat" file in root folder) ----------\n\n@echo off\ncd /d %~dp0\n\nrem ON MINING RIGS SET MININGRIG=TRUE\nSET MININGRIG=FALSE\n\nif not "%GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR%"=="1" (setx GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 1) > nul\nif not "%GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE%"=="100" (setx GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE 100) > nul\nif not "%GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS%"=="1" (setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1) > nul\nif not "%GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT%"=="100" (setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100) > nul\nif not "%GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT%"=="100" (setx GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT 100) > nul\nif not "%CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER%"=="PCI_BUS_ID" (setx CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER PCI_BUS_ID) > nul\n\nset "command=& .\\multipoolminer.ps1 -Wallet 1Q24z7gHPDbedkaWDTFqhMF8g7iHMehsCb -UserName aaronsace -WorkerName multipoolminer -Region europe -Currency btc,usd,eur -DeviceName amd,nvidia,cpu -PoolName miningpoolhubcoins,zpool,nicehash -Algorithm blake2s,cuckaroo39,cuckatoo31,cryptonightR,cryptonightV8,cryptonightheavy,decrednicehash,ethash,ethash2gb,ethash3gb,equihash,equihash1445,equihash1505,keccak,lbry,lyra2re3,mtp,mtpnicehash,neoscrypt,pascal,sib,skein,skunk,sonoa,timetravel10,x16r,x16rt,x16s,x17,x22i -Donate 24 -Watchdog -MinerStatusURL https://multipoolminer.io/monitor/miner.php -SwitchingPrevention 2"\n\nif exist "\\~\\*.dll" del "\\~\\*.dll" > nul 2>&1\n\nif /I "%MININGRIG%" EQU "TRUE" goto MINING\n\nrem Launch web dashboard\nset "command=%command% -Dashboard"\n\nif exist ".\\SnakeTail.exe" goto SNAKETAIL\n\nstart pwsh -noexit -executionpolicy bypass -command "& .\\reader.ps1 -log \'MultiPoolMiner_\\d\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\.txt\' -sort \'^[^_]*_\' -quickstart"\ngoto MINING\n\n:SNAKETAIL\ntasklist /fi "WINDOWTITLE eq SnakeTail - MPM_SnakeTail_LogReader*" /fo TABLE 2>nul | find /I /N "SnakeTail.exe" > nul 2>&1\nif "%ERRORLEVEL%"=="1" start /min .\\SnakeTail.exe .\\MPM_SnakeTail_LogReader.xml\n\n:MINING\npwsh -noexit -executionpolicy bypass -windowstyle maximized -command "%command%"\n\necho Powershell 6 or later is required.

The default config file name is \'.\\Config.txt\'.\nIf you do not include the command line parameter -ConfigFile [Path\\FileName.txt] then MPM will use the default file name. \n\nIf the config file does not exist MPM will create a config file with default values. If the file name does not have an extension MPM will add .txt file name extension.\nThe default config file contains only the parameters which are also available per command line. \nNote: More config items are added to the live configuration during runtime. For full list of available config items at runtime see the API at http://localhost:3999/config. All items could also be added manually to the config file (use with caution as this might lead to unpredictable results).\n\nThe config file is a JSON file and human readable / editable. A good primer for understanding the JSON structure can be found here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/json/index.htm\n\nWarning: The JSON file structure is very fragile - every comma counts, so be careful when editing this file manually. To test the validity of the structure use a web service like https://jsonblob.com (copy/paste the complete file).\n\n### Sample content of \'Config.txt\'\n\n```\n{\n  "Algorithm": "$Algorithm",\n  "AllowedBadShareRatio": "$AllowedBadShareRatio",\n  "API_ID": "$API_ID",\n  "API_Key": "$API_Key",\n  "APIPort": "$APIPort",\n  "BasePowerUsage": "$BasePowerUsage",\n  "BenchmarkInterval": "$BenchmarkInterval",\n  "CoinName": "$CoinName",\n  "ConfigFile": "$ConfigFile",\n  "Currency": "$Currency",\n  "CurrencySymbol": "$CurrencySymbol",\n  "Dashboard": "$Dashboard",\n  "Debug": "$Debug",\n  "Delay": "$Delay",\n  "DeviceName": "$DeviceName",\n  "DisableDevFeeMining": "$DisableDevFeeMining",\n  "DisableDeviceDetection": "$DisableDeviceDetection",\n  "DisableEstimateCorrection": "$DisableEstimateCorrection",\n  "DisableMinersWithDevFee": "$DisableMinersWithDevFee",\n  "Donate": "$Donate",\n  "ErrorAction": "$ErrorAction",\n  "ErrorVariable": "$ErrorVariable",\n  "ExcludeAlgorithm": "$ExcludeAlgorithm",\n  "ExcludeCurrencySymbol": "$ExcludeCurrencySymbol",\n  "ExcludeCoinName": "$ExcludeCoinName",\n  "ExcludeDeviceName": "$ExcludeDeviceName",\n  "ExcludeMinerName": "$ExcludeMinerName",\n  "ExcludePoolName": "$ExcludePoolName",\n  "HashRateSamplesPerInterval": "$HashRateSamplesPerInterval",\n  "HWiNFO64_SensorMapping": "$HWiNFO64_SensorMapping",\n  "IgnoreFees": "$IgnoreFees",\n  "IgnorePowerCost": "$IgnorePowerCost",\n  "InformationAction": "$InformationAction",\n  "InformationVariable": "$InformationVariable",\n  "Interval": "$Interval",\n  "IntervalMultiplier": "$IntervalMultiplier",\n  "MeasurePowerUsage": "$MeasurePowerUsage",\n  "MinAccuracy": 0.5,\n  "MinerName": "$MinerName",\n  "MinerStatusKey": "$MinerStatusKey",\n  "MinerStatusUrl": "$MinerStatusUrl",\n  "MinHashRateSamples": "$MinHashRateSamples",\n  "Currency": "$Currency",\n  "MinWorker": "$MinWorker",\n  "OutBuffer": "$OutBuffer",\n  "OutVariable": "$OutVariable",\n  "PipelineVariable": "$PipelineVariable",\n  "PoolBalancesUpdateInterval": "$PoolBalancesUpdateInterval",\n  "PoolName": "$PoolName",\n  "PowerPrices": "$PowerPrices",\n  "PricePenaltyFactor": "$PricePenaltyFactor",\n  "ProfitabilityThreshold": "$ProfitabilityThreshold",\n  "Proxy": "$Proxy",\n  "Region": "$Region",\n  "ReportStatusInterval": "$ReportStatusInterval",\n  "ShowAllMiners": "$ShowAllMiners",\n  "ShowAllPoolBalances": "$ShowAllPoolBalances",\n  "ShowMinerWindow": "$ShowMinerWindow",\n  "ShowPowerUsage": "$ShowPowerUsage",\n  "SingleAlgoMining": "$SingleAlgoMining",\n  "SSL": "$SSL",\n  "SwitchingPrevention": "$SwitchingPrevention",\n  "UserName": "$UserName",\n  "Verbose": "$Verbose",\n  "Wallet": "$Wallet",\n  "WarmupTime": "$WarmupTime",\n  "WarningAction": "$WarningAction",\n  "WarningVariable": "$WarningVariable",\n  "Watchdog": "$Watchdog",\n  "WorkerName": "$WorkerName",\n  "Pools": {},\n  "MinersLegacy": {},\n  "Wallets": {\n    "BTC": "$Wallet"\n  },\n  "VersionCompatibility": "3.3.0"\n}\n```\n\nThere is a section for Pools, Miners and a general section\n\n### Advanced configuration for Pools\n\nSettings for each configured pool are stored in its own subsection. These settings are only valid for the named pool.\n\n#### CoinName per pool [Zcash, ZeroCoin etc.]\nOnly mine the selected coins at the specified pool.\n\nE.g. To mine only Zcash & ZeroCoin at Zpool:\n\n    "Zpool-Coin": {\n      "CoinName":  [\n        "Zcash",\n        "ZeroCoin"\n      ]\n    }\nNote: Only the pools ending in ...-Coin expose all coin names in their API. Check the web dashboard / pools to see which pools expose which values.\n\n#### CurrencySymbol per pool [DGB, LTC, ZEC etc.]\nOnly mine the selected currencies at the specified pool.\n\nE.g. To mine only LTC & ZEC at Zpool:\n\n    "Zpool-Coin": {\n      "CurrencySymbol":  [\n        "LTC",\n        "ZEC"\n      ]\n    }\nNote: Only the pools ending in ...-Coin expose all currency symbols in their API. Check the web dashboard / pools to see which pools expose which values.\n\n#### DisableEstimateCorrection per pool\n\nSome pools overestimate the projected profits. By default MPM will reduce the projected algo price by a correction factor (actual_last24h / estimate_last24h) to counter the pool overestimated prices.\nE.g. To disable this at Zpool:\n\n    "Zpool-Algo": {\n      "DisableEstimateCorrection":  false\n    }\n    \n####ExcludeAlgorithm per pool\n\nDo not use the configured algorithms for mining at the specified pool.\n\nE.g. To NOT mine Equihash and Ethash2gb at Zpool:\n\n    "Zpool-Coin": {\n      "ExcludeAlgorithm":  [\n        "Equihash",\n        "Ethash2gb"\n      ]\n    }\n\n#### ExcludeCoinName per pool [Zcash, ZeroCoin etc.]\nExclude selected coins from being mined at the specified pool.\n\nE.g. To NOT mine Zcash & ZeroCoin at Zpool:\n\n    "Zpool-Coin": {\n      "ExcludeCoinName":  [\n        "Zcash",\n        "ZeroCoin"\n      ]\n    }\nNote: Only the pools ending in ...-Coin expose all coin names in their API. Check the web dashboard / pools to see which pools expose which values.\n\n#### ExcludeCurrencySymbol per pool [DGB, LTC, ZEC etc.]\nExclude selected currency symbol from being mined at the specified pool.\n\nE.g. To NOT mine DGB & LTC at Zpool:\n\n    "Zpool-Coin": {\n      "ExcludeCurrencySymbol":  [\n        "DGB",\n        "LTC"\n      ]\n    }\nNote: Only the pools ending in ...-Coin expose all currency symbols in their API. Check the web dashboard / pools to see which pools expose which values.\n\n#### ExcludeRegion per pool\nDo not use the pool endpoints in select regions. This may be useful when a pool has a problem with its endpoints in some regions, e.g. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=472510.msg51637436#msg51637436.\n\nE.g. To NOT use the MiningPoolHub mining endpoints in region \'Europe\':\n\n    "MiningPoolHub-Algo": {\n      "ExcludeRegion":  [\n        "Europe"\n      ]\n    }\nNote: The values for \'Regions\' must match the definitions in \'Regions.txt\'.\n\n#### MinWorker\nThis parameter allows to define a required minimum number of workers at the pool per algorithm. If there are less then the configured number of workers MPM will skip the affected algorithms.\nWildcards (* and ?) for the algorithm names are supported. If an algorithm name/wildcard matches more than one entry then the lower number takes priority.\nImportant: The general \'-MinWorker\' value is always applied. Only algorithms matching the global workers count will eventually be handled by the per-pool config. \n\nE.g. To ignore \'Ethash*\' & \'Equihash1445\' algorithms at MiningPoolHub if there are less than 10 workers set MinWorker like this:\n\n    "MiningPoolHub-Algo": {\n      "MinWorker":  {\n        "Ethash*":  10,\n        "Equihash1445":  10\n      }\n    }\nNote: Not all pools support this, for more information consult the pools web page or check the MPM web GUI\nIf *-MinWorker* is set on a general AND pool level, then the lower number takes priority.\n\n#### NiceHash internal wallet\n\nIf you have a NiceHash internal wallet you can configure MPM/NiceHash Pool to mine to the internal address. MPM will then use the lower pool fee of 1% for calculations.\n\nTo use the NiceHash internal wallet modify the NiceHash pool section (you may have to create is first). Enter your "<YOUR_NICEHASH_INTERNAL_WALLET>" (of course you need to insert the real BTC address), and set the flag \'"IsInternalWallet":  true\':\n\n    "NiceHash":  {\n      "Wallets":  {\n        "BTC":  "<YOUR_NICEHASH_INTERNAL_WALLET>"\n      },\n      "IsInternalWallet":  true\n    }\n\n#### Payout currency\n\nIf a pool allows payout in another currency than BTC you can set the currency you wish to be paid.\nBy default MPM will add ALL currencies configured by $Wallet as possible payout currencies for the pool.\n\nFor each pool you can statically add a section similar to this to your config file:\n\n    "Zpool-Algo": {\n      "Wallets":  {\n        "BTC": "$Wallet"\n      },\n      "Worker": "$WorkerName"\n    }\nThe payout currency is defined by this line:\n"BTC": "$Wallet", (MPM will use the the wallet address from the start.bat file)\n\nE.g. to change the payout currency for Zpool to LiteCoin replace the line for BTC with "LTC": "<YOUR_LITECOIN_ADDRESS>", (of course you need to insert a real LTC address)\n\n    "Zpool-Algo": {\n      "Wallets":  {\n        "LTC": "<YOUR_LITECOIN_ADDRESS>"\n      },\n      "Worker": "$WorkerName"\n    }\nNote: Not all pools support this, for more information consult the pools web page\n\n#### PricePenaltyFactor per pool\n\nIf you feel that a pool is exaggerating its estimations then set a penalty factor to lower projected projected calculations.\n\nE.g. You feel that Zpool is exaggerating its estimations by 10% - Set PricePenaltyFactor to 0.9:\n\n    "Zpool-Algo": {\n      "PricePenaltyFactor":  0.9\n    }\nNote: This is also a general parameter (see *-PricePenaltyFactor*). If both parameters - general and pool - are present, then the pool parameter takes precedence.\n\n#### Regions per pool\nOnly use the pool endpoints is selected regions. This may be useful when a pool has a problem with its endpoints in some regions, e.g. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=472510.msg51637436#msg51637436.\n\nE.g. To use MiningPoolHub mining endpoints in regions \'Asia\' and \'US\' ONLY:\n\n    "MiningPoolHub-Algo": {\n      "Region":  [\n        "Asia",\n        "US"\n      ]\n    }\nNote: The values for \'Regions\' must match the definitions in \'Regions.txt\'.\n\n#### Blockmasters &  ZergPool(Coins) Solo/Party mining\n\nCheck the pools web page for more information first!\nFor Blockmasters & ZergPool(Coins) solo or party mining edit the config file like this:   \n\n    "Pools": {\n      "Blockmasters-Algo": {\n        "PasswordSuffix": {\n          "Algorithm": {\n            "*": "",\n            "Equihash": ",m=solo"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      "ZergPool-Coin": {\n        "PasswordSuffix": {\n          "Algorithm": {\n            "*": "",\n            "Equihash": ",m=solo"\n          },\n          "CoinName": {\n            "*": "",\n            "Digibyte": ",m=solo"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n"\\*" stands for any algorithm / coinname. No other wildcards are allowed.\nAll values are cumulative, so if you specify a value for algorithm AND coinname, then both values will be appended.\n    \n\n### Advanced configuration for Miners\n\nSettings for each configured miner are stored in its own subsection. These settings are only valid for the named miner.\n\n#### ExcludeAlgorithm per miner\n\nE.g. To exclude the Ethash3gb algorithm from any version of the ClaymoreEthash miner:\n\n    "MinersLegacy": {\n      "ClaymoreEthash": {\n        "*": {\n          "ExcludeAlgorithm": [\n            "Ethash2gb"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nE.g. To exclude the Ethash2gb or Blake2s algorithms from ClaymoreEthash-v15.0 miner:\n\n    "MinersLegacy": {\n      "ClaymoreEthash": {\n        "v15.0": {\n          "ExcludeAlgorithm": [\n            "Blake2s",\n            "Ethash2gb"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n"\\*" stands for ANY miner version.\nThe algorithm name must be entered in the normalized form as returned by Get-Algorithm.\nIf both, a version specific and generic config ("\\*") exist, then all matching algorithms are excluded.\n\n#### Disable miner developer fee per miner\nNote: not all miners support turning off their built in fees, others will reduce the hashrate, check the miners web page for more information\n\nE.g. To disable the dev fee mining from any version of the ClaymoreEthash miner:\n\n    "MinersLegacy": {\n      "ClaymoreEthash": {\n        "*": {\n          "DisableDevFeeMining":  true\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nE.g. To disable the dev fee mining from ClaymoreEthash-v15.0 miner:\n\n    "MinersLegacy": {\n      "ClaymoreEthash": {\n        "v15.0": {\n          "DisableDevFeeMining":  true\n        }\n      }\n    }\n"\\*" stands for ANY miner version.\nIf this setting is defined in multiple places (version specific, version generic ("\\*") and global), then the most specific value is used.\n\n#### Secondary algorithm intensities (dual algo miners only)\n\nThe mining intensities for secondary algorithms can be configured in the config file.\n\nThe miner name must be entered without the ending version number (e.g. for ClaymoreEthash-v15.0 remove -v15.0)\nThe algorithm names must be entered as the miner uses it, do not use the normalized algorithm name as returned by Get-Algorithm.\n\n    "MinersLegacy": {\n      "ClaymoreEthash": {\n        "*": {\n          "SecondaryAlgoIntensities": {\n            "blake2s": [\n              45,\n              60,\n              75\n            ],\n            "pascal": [\n              30,\n              60,\n              90\n            ]\n          }\n        },\n        "v15.0": {\n          "SecondaryAlgoIntensities": {\n            "decred": [\n              25,\n              40,\n              65\n            ]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n"\\*" stands for ANY version\nIf both, specific (e.g. miner version) and generic config ("\\*") exist, then only the specific config is used. The generic config will be ignored entirely.\nIf you do not specify clustom values for all algorithms, then the miners default values will be applied for the unconfigured algorithms.\n\n#### Persistent miner configuration\nStoring the miner configuration in the config file allows for easier version / miner file upgrades. There is no need to edit the miner files.\n\nThe miner name must be entered without the ending version number (e.g. for ClaymoreEthash-v15.0 remove -v15.0)\nThe algorithm name must be entered in the normalized form as returned by Get-Algorithm.\nNote: All parameter values must be entered with a leading space (\' \') character!\n\n    "MinersLegacy": {\n      "ClaymoreEthash": {\n        "*": {\n          "Commands": {\n            "*": " --no-crashreport",\n            "Ethash2gb": " -ethi 9",\n            "Ethash2gbPascal-20": " -colors"\n          },\n          "CommonCommands": ""\n        },\n        "v15.0": {\n          "Commands": {\n            "*": " --no-crashreport",\n            "Ethash2gb": " -ethi 9",\n            "Ethash2gbPascal-20": " -colors"\n          },\n          "CommonCommands": ""\n        }\n      }\n    }\n"\\*" stands for ANY version or ANY algorithm.\n**If both, specific (e.g. miner version / algorithm name) and generic config ("\\*") exist, then only the specific config is used. The generic config will be ignored entirely.**\n**Important: The miner config defined in the config file overrides all \'out-of-the-box\' config that is defined in the miner definition file.**\n\nCommands: These settings will be added to the miner command line for the selected miner algorithm.\nCommonCommands: These settings will be added to the miner command line for ALL miner algorithms.\nCommands and CommonCommands are cumulative.\n\nNote: If you configure *Persistent miner configuration* and *Customize miner commands*, then the config data from *Persistent miner configuration* take precedence.\n\n#### Customize miner commands\nMPM stores all default miner commands (= what algos to mine and the commands to do so) in the miner file. You can override these commands with your own by modifing the config file.\n\nThe miner name must be entered without the ending version number (e.g. for ClaymoreEthash-v15.0 remove -v15.0)\nThe algorithm name must be entered in the normalized form as returned by Get-Algorithm.\nCommands must match the data structure as found in the existing miner files. Not all miners use the same parameters.\n\n    "MinersLegacy": {\n      "ClaymoreEthash": {\n        "*": {\n          "CustomCommands": [\n            {\n              "MainAlgorithm": "Ethash2gb",\n              "MinMemGB": 2,\n              "SecondaryAlgorithm": "blake2s",\n              "SecondaryIntensity": 25,\n              "Params": " -colors"\n            },\n            {\n              "MainAlgorithm": "ethash3gb",\n              "MinMemGB": 2,\n              "SecondaryAlgorithm": "blake2s",\n              "SecondaryIntensity": 35,\n              "Params": " -colors"\n            }\n          ],\n          "CommonCommands": " -dbg -1"\n        },\n        "v15.0": {\n          "CustomCommands": [\n            {\n              "MainAlgorithm": "Ethash2gb",\n              "MinMemGB": 2,\n              "SecondaryAlgorithm": "blake2s",\n              "SecondaryIntensity": 25,\n              "Params": " -colors"\n            },\n            {\n              "MainAlgorithm": "ethash3gb",\n              "MinMemGB": 2,\n              "SecondaryAlgorithm": "blake2s",\n              "SecondaryIntensity": 35,\n              "Params": " -colors"\n            }\n          ],\n          "CommonCommands": " -dbg -1"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n"\\*" stands for ANY version or ANY algorithm.\n**If both, specific (e.g. miner version / algorithm name) and generic config ("\\*") exist, then only the specific config is used. The generic config will be ignored entirely.**\n**Important: The custom miner commands defined in the config file override ALL \'out-of-the-box\' commands that are defined in the miner definition file. Ensure you include all algorithms and the needed commands in the \'CustomCommands\'.**\n\nNote: If you configure *Persistent miner configuration* and *Customize miner commands*, then the config data from *Persistent miner configuration* take precedence.\n\n#### Pre- / post miner program execution\nMPM can execute any program/script/batch file on any of these events:\n\n- before a miner gets started (PreStopCommand)\n- after a miner got startet (PostStartCommand)\n- before a miner gets started (PreStopCommand)\n- after a miner got stopped (PostStopCommand)\n- after miner failure got detected (PostFailureCommand)\n\nModify the config file to define the program and its parameters. E.g.\n\n    "MinersLegacy": {\n      "*": {\n        "PreStartCommand": "_ the command put here would be run before ANY miner gets started",\n        "PostStartCommand": "cmd.exe /c ECHO $((Get-Date).ToUniversalTime()): Starting miner ($($Miner.Name) {$(($Miner.Algorithm | ForEach-Object {\\"$($_)@$($Pools.$_.Name)\\"}) -join \\"; \\")}).  >> .\\\\Logs\\\\minerstart.log",\n        "PreStopCommand": "REM run this command before the miner gets stopped",\n        "PostStopCommand": "cmd.exe /c ECHO $((Get-Date).ToUniversalTime()): Stopped miner ($($Miner.Name) {$(($Miner.Algorithm | ForEach-Object {\\"$($_)@$($Pools.$_.Name)\\"}) -join \\"; \\")}).  >> .\\\\Logs\\\\minerstop.log",\n        "PostFailureCommand": "_ the command put here would be run after any miner failure"\n      },\n      "lolMinerEquihash": {\n        "*": {\n          "PreStartCommand": "\'C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\MSI Afterburner\\\\MSIAfterburner.exe\' -Profile1",\n          "PostStartCommand": ""\n          "PreStopCommand": "_ the command put here would be run  before lolMinerEquihash miner (any version) gets stopped",\n          "PostStopCommand": "",\n          "PostFailureCommand": ""\n        }\n      },\n      "CryptoDredge": {\n        "v0.22.0": {\n          "PreStartCommand": "\'C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\MSI Afterburner\\\\MSIAfterburner.exe\' -Profile2",\n          "PostStartCommand": ""\n          "PreStopCommand": "_ the command put here would be run before CryptoDredge-v0.20.2 miner gets stopped",\n          "PostStopCommand": "",\n          "PostFailureCommand": "shutdown /r /t 10"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n"\\*" stands for ANY miner or ANY miner version.\nThe miner name must be entered without the ending version number (e.g. for CryptoDredge-v0.20.2 remove -v0.20.2)\n**Important: If two or more entries match, then the more specific entry is executed.**\n\n**Double quotes (") or backslashes must be escaped with backslash as shown below.**\n**To execute simple batch file commands you need to use \'cmd.exe /c \'.**\n\nYou can also use any MPM internal variables or simple powershell code like this:\n      "PreStartCommand": "$(if (($Miner.Algorithm | Select-Object -Index 0) -eq \\"MTP") {\\"\'C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Tools\\\\MSI Afterburner\\\\MSIAfterburner.exe\' -Profile1\\"})",\n      "PostStartCommand": "cmd.exe /c ECHO $((Get-Date).ToUniversalTime()): Started miner ($($Miner.Name) {$(($Miner.Algorithm | ForEach-Object {\\"$($_)@$($Pools.$_.Name)\\"}) -join \\"; \\")}).  >> .\\\\Logs\\\\minerstart.log"\n\n          \n### Advanced general configuration\n\nSettings in this section affect the overall behaviour of MPM and will take precedence over command line parameters.\n\n#### Ignore pool and miner fees\n\nBeginning with version 3.1.0 MPM makes miner and pool fees part of the profitability calculation. This will lead to somewhat lower, but more accurate profit estimates.\n\nTo ignore miner and pool fees (as older versions did) add \'"IgnoreFees":  true\' to the general section:\n\n    {\n      "SwitchingPrevention":  "$SwitchingPrevention",\n      "IgnoreFees":  true\n    }\n\n#### Interval Multiplier\n\nSome algorithms produce very fluctuating hash rate numbers. In oder to get more stable values these algorithms require a longer benchmark period.\nTo override the defaults add a section similar to this to the general section in the config file (these are the default values):\n\n    "IntervalMultiplier": {\n        "EquihashR15053": 2,\n        "Mtp": 2,\n        "MtpNicehash": 2,\n        "ProgPow": 2,\n        "Rfv2": 2,\n        "X16r": 5,\n        "X16Rt": 3,\n        "X16RtGin": 3,\n        "X16RtVeil": 3\n    } \nNote: The custom config section in the config file replaces the defaults for ALL algorithms. Any algorithm not explicitly configured will be set to the default value of 1 (unless there is a hardcoded value in the miner file).\n\n#### PricePenaltyFactor\n\nDefault factor with which MPM multiplies the prices reported by ALL pools. The default value is 1 (valid range is from 0.1 to 1.0). \nE.g. You feel that MPM is exaggerating its profit estimations by 20% for ALL pools - Set PricePenaltyFactor to 0.8:\n\n    }\n      "SwitchingPrevention":  "$SwitchingPrevention",\n      "PricePenaltyFactor":  0.8\n    }\nNote: This is also a pool parameter (see *PricePenaltyFactor per pool*). If both parameters - general and pool - are present, then the pool parameter takes precedence.\n\n#### To show miner windows\n\nBy default MPM hides most miner windows as to not steal focus. All miners write their output to files in the Log folder.\n\nTo show the miner windows add \'"ShowMinerWindow":  true\' to the general section:\n\n    {\n      "SwitchingPrevention":  "$SwitchingPrevention",\n      "ShowMinerWindow":  true\n    }\nNote: Showing the miner windows disables writing the miner output to log files. Miners of API type \'Wrapper\' will remain hidden.\n\n#### Pool Balances\n\nMPM can gather the pending BTC balances from all configured pools.\n\nTo display the balances of all enabled pools (excluding those that are excluded with *-ExcludeMinerName*) on the summary screen and in the web GUI add \'"ShowPoolBalances":  true\' to the general section:\n    {\n      "SwitchingPrevention":  "$SwitchingPrevention",\n      "ShowPoolBalances":  true\n    }\n\nTo display the sum of each currency in the balances (depending on \'ShowPoolBalancesExcludedPools\' including those that are excluded with \'ExcludeMinerName\') and the exchange rates for all currencies on the summary screen add \'"ShowPoolBalancesDetails": true\' to the general section:\n    {\n      "SwitchingPrevention":  "$SwitchingPrevention",\n      "ShowPoolBalancesDetails": true\n    }\t\n\nTo display the balances of all pools (including those that are excluded with *-ExcludeMinerName*) on the summary screen and in the web GUI add \'"ShowPoolBalances":  true\' to the general section:\n    {\n      "SwitchingPrevention":  "$SwitchingPrevention",\n      "ShowPoolBalancesExcludedPools":  true\n    }\nNote: Only balances in BTC are listed, other currencies are currently not supported.\n\n\n## UNPROFITABLE ALGORITHMS\n\nAs more and more algorithms can be mined with ASICs mining them with GPUs becomes unprofitable.\nTo add algorithms to the list edit \'UnprofitableAlgorithms.txt\' in the MPM directory.\n```\n[\n     "Bitcoin",\n     "Blake2s",\n     "BlakeCoin",\n     "BlakeVanilla",\n     "Cryptolight",\n     "Cryptonight",\n     "CryptonightV7",\n     "Decred",\n     "Groestl",\n     "Keccak",\n     "KeccakC",\n     "Lbry",\n     "Lyra2RE",\n     "Lyra2RE2",\n     "Lyra2z",\n     "MyriadGroestl",\n     "Nist5",\n     "Quark",\n     "Qubit",\n     "Scrypt",\n     "ScryptN",\n     "SHA256d",\n     "SHA256t",\n     "Sia",\n     "Sib",\n     "Skein",\n     "X11",\n     "X13",\n     "X14",\n     "X15"\n ]\n```\n\nNote: MPM will no longer mine/benchmark these algorithms as main algorithms, but they will still be used as secondary algorithm for dual miners.\n\n\n\n## MULTIPOOLMINER\'S LOGIC\n\n### General overview:\n\n- The various pools estimated profit values (visible on their respective web pages) are determined by the pools themselves. Each algorithm\'s estimated profit value is a combination of the current mined coin\'s last known exchange value in BTC, the coins network difficulty (or network hashrate) and the current pools overall hashrate.\n- MPM polls all pools it knows about (enabled or not) on a pre-defined interval (default is every 60 seconds) to gather the pools estimated profit for all of its advertised algorithms. As these profits change at each polling interval (based on the three factors mentioned above), MPM tracks how often and how drastic the changes are per algorithm and records this per-algorithm as a "fluctuation" metric. This fluctuation or margin-of-error is represented in MPM\'s output as "accuracy". e.g. An algorithm whose reported estimated profit values have a 90% accuracy can be conversely thought of as having a 10% margin-of-error.\n- As MPM repeatedly polls the pools over time, the more correct the reported accuracy (i.e. margin of error) becomes for a particular pools algorithm.\n- Due to the nature of pool-based mining, it is generally considered better to mine longer on algorithms that are most profitable with low margin-of-error over time (i.e. high accuracy). Technically, this takes into account concepts like PPLNS vs. PPS, ramp-up time for reported pool hash rate vs. miner reported hash rates, new/cheap coins with wildly fluctuating exchange prices etc.\n\n### Switching (or anti-switching) logic:\n\n- MPM retrieves the estimated profit for all pools/algorithms and filters out any undesired algorithms.\n- The estimated profit for each pool/algorithm combo is reduced by a calculated percentage amount (see below for specifics) to determine a "biased" estimated profit.\n- The "biased" estimated profits for each enabled pool/algorithm are combined with the benchmark hashrates previously calculated for all miners to calculate potential profit for your specific rig.\n- The most profitable miner/algorithm/pool combination for your rig is selected and (if it isn\'t already running) it is launched.\n- MPM idles for a pre-defined interval of time (default 60 seconds), then repeats the steps above.\n\n##### **Formula:**\n\n    [Price] x (1 - ([Fluctuation] x [Switching Prevention] x 0.9^[Intervals Past]))\n    i.e. 123 x (1 - (0.2 x 2 x 0.9^5)\n    \nwhere:\n\n    123 is BTC\n    1 is 100%\n    0.2 is 80% accuracy\n    0.9 is 10% reduction\n    5 is minutes if interval is 60 seconds\n\n##### **Example 1:**\n\n\tIf SwitchingPrevention = 2 and accuracy of most profitable coin = 90%\n\tThen NegativeValue = -20%\n\n\tThe negative value then decays by 10% every minute.\n\n\tIt can switch at any moment but to put the negative value into perspective:\n\tTakes 6 minutes for 20% to reduce to 10%.\n\tTakes 28 minutes for 20% to reduce to 1%.\n\t\n##### **Example 2:**\n\n\tIf SwitchingPrevention = 4 and accuracy of most profitable coin = 90%\n\tThen NegativeValue = -40%\n\t\n\tIt takes 13 minutes for 40% to reduce to 10%.\n\t0.9 ^ 13 * 40 = 10\n\t\n\n### Determination of "biased" estimated profit:\n\nThe percentage amount that a reported estimated profit value is reduced, is based on the calculation below.\n\nPercent Estimated Profit Reduction = (Margin of Error * SwitchingPrevention) / (Value that grows exponentially based on the number of minutes current miner has been running)\n\nThis means that the longer the current miner is running, the less MPM takes the Margin of Error into consideration and the less it reduces the estimated profit value. By adjusting the -SwitchingPrevention value up, you increase the effect the Margin of Error has on the calculation and, therefore, increase the amount of current miner run-time required to reduce this effect.\n\nIn practice, this explains why when you first launch MPM it may pick a pool/algorithm combo that has a lower value in the "Currency/Day" column, as it is favoring a more accurate combo. Over time, assuming the more profitable pool/algorithm stays more profitable, the accuracy will have less and less weight in the miner selection calculation process until MPM eventually switches over to it.\n\n*Please note: that a new install of MultiPoolMiner has no historical information on which to build accurate "margin-of-error" values. MPM will, therefore, sometimes make less desirable miner selections and switch more often until it can gather enough coin data to stabilize its decision-making process.*\n\n\n\n## MULTIPOOLMINER WEB GUI:\n\nMultiPoolMiner has a built in Web GUI at http://localhost:3999 (port is 3999 unless you have changed the default API port)\n\n\n\n## MULTIPOOLMINER API\n\nMultiPoolMiner allows basic monitoring through its built in API.\n\nAPI data is available at http://localhost:3999/<resource> (port is 3999 unless you have changed the default API port)\n\nFor a list of supported API commands open [MPM directory\\]APIDocs.html with your web browser.\n\n\n\n## KNOWN ISSUES\n\nThere are known issues with the following miners not submitting shares or show higher hashrate than what they actually do:\n- NVIDIA_CCminerLyra2Z (deprecated)\n- NVIDIA_CCminerLyra2RE2 (deprecated)\nThis is not a fault of MultiPoolMiner and nothing can be done on our end. Please raise an issue on their respective github pages. See FAQ#2 on how to exclude these if you wish to do so.\n\n\n\n## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n###### Q1. How do I start using MultiPoolMiner?\n###### A1. The \'start.bat\' file is an example that shows how to run the script without prompting for a username. Amend it with your username/address/workername and other relevant details such as region. Ensure it is run as Administrator to prevent errors.\n\n###### Q2. A miner crashes my computer or does not work correctly. I want to exclude it from mining/benchmarking. What should I do?\n###### A2. Use the -excludeminername command to exclude certain miners you don\'t want to use. A full list of available miners and parameters used can be found here: https://multipoolminer.io/miners\n\n###### Q3. Miner says CL device is missing (or not found). How do I resolve this issue?\n###### A3. You most likely have NVIDIA cards in your rig. Open the start.bat in a text editor and look for \'-devicename amd,nvidia,cpu\' and change it to \'-devicename nvidia,cpu\'. This will disable the AMD exclusive miners and save you plenty of time when benchmarking. You can also exclude the cpu option if you don\'t want to mine with your processor.\n\n###### Q4. I only want to mine certain algorithms even if they are not the most profitable. I want to exclude algorithms. How do I do that?\n###### A4. Open the start.bat in a text editor and look for \'-algorithm cryptonightv7,ethash,equihash,groestl,lyra2z,neoscrypt,pascal\'. Delete the algorithms you don\'t want to mine. This can save you some time when benchmarking. You can include any of these or even all of them if you please but bear in mind this can result your earnings to be spread across many pools! \n\n###### Q5. MultiPoolMiner is XX% more profitable. What does this mean?\n###### A5. It is showing you the stat for MultiPoolMiner vs the one miner. It means that the calculated earnings of MultiPoolMiner switching to different algorithms would be that much more profitable than if it had just mined that one particular algorithm the whole time. The number is still only an estimate of your earnings on the pool and may not directly reflect what you actually get paid. On MiningPoolHub and other multiple algorithm pools, coins have fluctuating values and MultiPoolMiner switches to the one that is the most profitable at that time. Because each pool has different delays in exchange and payout, the amount you actually earn my be very different. If there is a significant difference in percentage, you might want to reset the profitability stats by running the ResetProfit.bat file. Your actual (but still estimated) earning is shown in the second row.\n\n###### Q6. I want to re-run the benchmarks (changed OC settings, added new cards, etc.)\n###### A6. Simply run \'ResetBenchmark.bat\' This deletes all files in the /Stats folder. This will force MultiPoolMiner to run the benchmarks again. If you only want to re-run a single benchmark for a coin or algorithm, locate the appropriate stat file for that particular coin or algorithm and delete it. Please note some of the miners can do multiple algorithms therefore have multiple stat files for the same miner and some of them create multiple stat files for the different configuration files they use.\n\n###### Q7. How long does benchmarking take to finish?\n###### A7. This is greatly dependant on the amount of selected algorithms and the number of device types chosen in the start.bat file. By default, each benchmark takes one minute. You can speed up benchmarking significantly by omitting unused device types. For example if you have a rig with AMD cards, you can tell MPM not to even launch the NVIDIA or CPU specific miner applications by removing these after the -devicename parameter in the start.bat file.\n\n###### Q8. Is it possible to choose how many GPUs we want to allocate to mining or restrict mining on certain GPUs?\n###### A8. This feature will possibly be implemented in the future (planned enhancement for MultiPoolMiner V3) but not yet supported by MultiPoolMiner.\n\n###### Q9. MultiPoolMiner says it cannot find excavator.exe\n###### A9. Excavator is developed by Nicehash and their EULA does not permit redistribution of their software which means you need to download Excavator yourself from https://github.com/nicehash/excavator/releases and place it in /Bin/Excavator/ (create the folder if does not exist). This is the permitted use of Excavator. Another solution is to delete the Excavator configuration file from the /Miners folder if you don\'t plan to use this miner.\n\n###### Q10. MultiPoolMiner is taking up too much space on my drive\n###### A10. Simply run \'RemoveLogs.bat\' This will delete all unnecessary and/or old log files that can indeed take up a lot of space of your storage device. It is perfectly safe to do so if space is required.\n\n###### Q11. What does \'ResetProfit.bat\' do?\n###### A11. This will reset your profit statistics and deletes all coin profibility data accumulated since MultiPoolMiner was first launched. This can be helpful when your predicted income stats (calculated average results) are broken which can happen when ie. an existing coin is added to a new exchange and the price falsely skyrockets due to low volume and liquidity. Bear in mind MultiPoolMiner becomes more accurate over time at calculating your profitability and running this scrypt will delete all that recorded data.\n\n###### Q12. Why does MultiPoolMiner open multiple miners of the same type?\n###### A12. Not all miners support multiple GPUs and this is a workaround to resolve this issue. MultiPoolMiner will try to open upto 6 instances of some of the miners to support systems with upto 6 GPUs or to overcome other problems found while testing. Doing so makes no difference in performance and donation amount to the miner sw developer (if applicable) will be the same percentage as if it was a single instance run for multiple GPUs ie. if one instance is run for five cards or five instances, one for each of the the five cards, that is still the same 1% donation NOT 5x1%.\n\n###### Q13. MultiPoolMiner does not close miners properly (2 or more instances of the same miner accumulate over time)\n###### A13. This is due to miner failure most likely caused by too much OVERCLOCKING. When miner fails it tries to recover which usually means restarting itself in the same window. This causes issues with the API connection to the miner and MultiPoolMiner thinks miner quit and launches another instance as a result. Due to default API port still being used by the first launched but failed miner, MPM can launch many instances of the same miner over time. This behaviour will be improved upon in the future but can only be completely solved by the user by lowering overclock to keep miners and the system stable.  \n\n###### Q14. Is it possible to change the payout currency from BTC to something else when mining on yiimp-based pools such as Zpool, Hash Refinery, etc?\n###### A14. Yes, see https://github.com/MultiPoolMiner/MultiPoolMiner#to-change-payout-currency-of-a-pool. However this is not recommended as your payout will become uncertain as all other payout currencies are internally exchanged therefore you may end up losing your earnings due to pool never having enough coins to pay you!\n\n###### Q15. How do I customise miners to better work with my cards?\n###### A15. Some cards may require special parameters to be used in order to make them (more) stable, such as setting intensity for specific miners/algos/GPUs. This can be done by heading to the /Miners folder and editing the relevant miner files or via advanced constomization (see *Advanced configuration for Miners -> Add custom miner commands*). For example, for CcminerTpruvot.ps1 you can replace (mind the spaces!)\n    "x17" = "" # X17\n\n###### with:\n\n    "x17" = " -i 20" # X17 \n\n###### to add intensity setting for that specific algorithm while used in conjuction with tpruvot\'s ccminer fork. This will result this specific miner on that specific algorithm will use the intensity setting of 20 which may help if you are experiencing driver crashes when using certain cards. Please search relevant forums for correct and recommended settings before changing anything!\n\n###### Q16. I am getting: \n    ErrorCode error = method(handle, name, <IntPtr>Marshal.SizeOf<T>(),h.AddrOfPinnedObject(), out size);\n    \n###### A16. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 or later is required for MultiPoolMiner to function properly. [Web Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773)\n\n###### Q17. Is there an option to split earnings? I want to mine 80% of the time to wallet A and 20% of the time to wallet B.\n###### A17. This feature is not implemented, however, there are external services you can use to achieve the same such as [coinsplit.io/](https://coinsplit.io/)\n\n###### Q18. How to change fault tolerance limit to a higher percentage?\n###### A18. Fault tolerance limit was implemented to detect unwanted negative or positive spikes in your hashrate caused by faulty miners or GPUs and prevent these statistics to be recorded to keep your benchmark data preserved in these unfortunate events. You should not feel the need to change this but first try to resolve the issues with your miners and/or devices. That said, if you are absolutely certain you want to change this, you can do so by amending the following line in Include.psm1:\n    [Math]::Min([Math]::Max($Stat.Week_Fluctuation * 2, 0.1), 0.9)\n    \n###### From:\n    0.1), 0.9)\n###### TO:\n    0.3), 0.75)\n\n###### This will change the fault tolerance limit from +/-10% to +30/-25%.\n\n###### Q19. MultiPoolMiner is not mining the most profitable algorithm. Why?\n###### A19. MPM version 2.7 introduced a smarter spike resistance for both of your hashrate and coin difficulty/price ratio. This feature will detect and handle mining accordingly to prevent you losing time and profit. The usual case is, if an algorithm\'s price fluctuates a lot, then the short time profit might appear to be higher, but by the time you have mined it for a period of time, the coins will be exchanged for a much lower price and your mining will be less profitable. This is due to the PPLNS(+) nature implemented in the pools. To mitigate this effect MPM uses an 24h mean price (if provided by the pool) when determininig the most profitable algorithm. (#712, #713, query re NH to be resolved/omitted)\n\n###### Q20. I am getting the following error: "NetFirewallRule - Access denied"\n###### A20. You cannot put MultiPoolMiner inside directorires such as Program Files. Extract it to a non-restricted or user-created folder such as Desktop, Downloads, Documents, C:\\MPM\\ etc.\n\n###### Q21. My antivirus says the .zip package contains a virus or MultiPoolMiner tries to download viruses. What should I do?\n###### A21. MultiPoolMiner is open-source and used by many users/rigs. It also downloads miners from github releases that are open-sourced projects. That means the code is readable and you can see for yourself it does not contain any viruses. Your antivirus generates false positives as the miner software used by MultiPoolMiner are often included in malicious programs to create botnets for someone who wants to earn a quick buck. There are other closed-source miner program included in the package such as the Claymore miners. These come from legendary ranked or trusted/respected members of the bitcointalk community and used by a large number of users/rigs worldwide. You can exlude these miners if you wish by following the instructions in FAQ#2 and delete their software from your system. \n\n###### Q22. How to disable dual-mining?\n###### A22. Add \'-SingleAlgoMining\' to your start batch file or to the config file.\n\n###### Q23. How to download and install missing miner binaries?\n###### A23. Some miners binaries cannot be downloaded automatically by MPM (e.g. there is no direct download). In these cases you need to download and install them manually. First find the download link "Uri" in the miner file (they are all in the folder \'Miners\') and download the binaries. Next locate the destination path "$Path". You need to create the required subdirectory in the \'Miners\' folder.  Finally unpack the downloaded binary to the destination directory. If the packed file contains subdirectories you must also copy them.\n\n\n## REPORTING AND MONITORING\n##### TERMS AND CONDITIONS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\n###### By enabling the Monitoring Service by setting the *-MinerStatusURL* to point to *https://multipoolminer.io/monitor/miner.php* as described in the **Command Line Options** section, you agree that the https://multipoolminer.io website can store relevant information about your mining rig(s) in its database that is directly accessible by anyone accessing the https://multipoolminer.io/monitor webpage with the corresponding wallet address (your BTC address set with the *-wallet* parameter, alternatively you can use *-minerstatuskey* parameter).
