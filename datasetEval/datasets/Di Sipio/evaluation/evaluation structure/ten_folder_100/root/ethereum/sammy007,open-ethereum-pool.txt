b'## Open Source Ethereum Mining Pool\n\n![Miner\'s stats page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7374093/31591180-43c72364-b236-11e7-8d47-726cd66b876a.png)\n\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sammy007/open-ethereum-pool](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/sammy007/open-ethereum-pool?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sammy007/open-ethereum-pool.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/sammy007/open-ethereum-pool) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/sammy007/open-ethereum-pool)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/sammy007/open-ethereum-pool)\n\n### Features\n\n**This pool is being further developed to provide an easy to use pool for Ethereum miners. This software is functional however an optimised release of the pool is expected soon. Testing and bug submissions are welcome!**\n\n* Support for HTTP and Stratum mining\n* Detailed block stats with luck percentage and full reward\n* Failover geth instances: geth high availability built in\n* Modern beautiful Ember.js frontend\n* Separate stats for workers: can highlight timed-out workers so miners can perform maintenance of rigs\n* JSON-API for stats\n\n#### Proxies\n\n* [Ether-Proxy](https://github.com/sammy007/ether-proxy) HTTP proxy with web interface\n* [Stratum Proxy](https://github.com/Atrides/eth-proxy) for Ethereum\n\n### Building on Linux\n\nDependencies:\n\n  * go >= 1.9\n  * geth or parity\n  * redis-server >= 2.8.0\n  * nodejs >= 4 LTS\n  * nginx\n\n**I highly recommend to use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.**\n\nFirst install  [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Installation-Instructions-for-Ubuntu).\n\nClone & compile:\n\n    git config --global http.https://gopkg.in.followRedirects true\n    git clone https://github.com/sammy007/open-ethereum-pool.git\n    cd open-ethereum-pool\n    make\n\nInstall redis-server.\n\n### Running Pool\n\n    ./build/bin/open-ethereum-pool config.json\n\nYou can use Ubuntu upstart - check for sample config in <code>upstart.conf</code>.\n\n### Building Frontend\n\nInstall nodejs. I suggest using LTS version >= 4.x from https://github.com/nodesource/distributions or from your Linux distribution or simply install nodejs on Ubuntu Xenial 16.04.\n\nThe frontend is a single-page Ember.js application that polls the pool API to render miner stats.\n\n    cd www\n\nChange <code>ApiUrl: \'//example.net/\'</code> in <code>www/config/environment.js</code> to match your domain name. Also don\'t forget to adjust other options.\n\n    npm install -g ember-cli@2.9.1\n    npm install -g bower\n    npm install\n    bower install\n    ./build.sh\n\nConfigure nginx to serve API on <code>/api</code> subdirectory.\nConfigure nginx to serve <code>www/dist</code> as static website.\n\n#### Serving API using nginx\n\nCreate an upstream for API:\n\n    upstream api {\n        server 127.0.0.1:8080;\n    }\n\nand add this setting after <code>location /</code>:\n\n    location /api {\n        proxy_pass http://api;\n    }\n\n#### Customization\n\nYou can customize the layout using built-in web server with live reload:\n\n    ember server --port 8082 --environment development\n\n**Don\'t use built-in web server in production**.\n\nCheck out <code>www/app/templates</code> directory and edit these templates\nin order to customise the frontend.\n\n### Configuration\n\nConfiguration is actually simple, just read it twice and think twice before changing defaults.\n\n**Don\'t copy config directly from this manual. Use the example config from the package,\notherwise you will get errors on start because of JSON comments.**\n\n```javascript\n{\n  // Set to the number of CPU cores of your server\n  "threads": 2,\n  // Prefix for keys in redis store\n  "coin": "eth",\n  // Give unique name to each instance\n  "name": "main",\n\n  "proxy": {\n    "enabled": true,\n\n    // Bind HTTP mining endpoint to this IP:PORT\n    "listen": "0.0.0.0:8888",\n\n    // Allow only this header and body size of HTTP request from miners\n    "limitHeadersSize": 1024,\n    "limitBodySize": 256,\n\n    /* Set to true if you are behind CloudFlare (not recommended) or behind http-reverse\n      proxy to enable IP detection from X-Forwarded-For header.\n      Advanced users only.

(Advanced users)\n\nI recommend this deployment strategy:\n\n* Mining instance - 1x (it depends, you can run one node for EU, one for US, one for Asia)\n* Unlocker and payouts instance - 1x each (strict!)\n* API instance - 1x\n\n### Notes\n\n* Unlocking and payouts are sequential, 1st tx go, 2nd waiting for 1st to confirm and so on. You can disable that in code. Carefully read `docs/PAYOUTS.md`.\n* Also, keep in mind that **unlocking and payouts will halt in case of backend or node RPC errors**. In that case check everything and restart.\n* You must restart module if you see errors with the word *suspended*.\n* Don\'t run payouts and unlocker modules as part of mining node. Create separate configs for both, launch independently and make sure you have a single instance of each module running.\n* If `poolFeeAddress` is not specified all pool profit will remain on coinbase address. If it specified, make sure to periodically send some dust back required for payments.\n\n### Alternative Ethereum Implementations\n\nThis pool is tested to work with [Ethcore\'s Parity](https://github.com/ethcore/parity). Mining and block unlocking works, but I am not sure about payouts and suggest to run *official* geth node for payments.\n\n### Credits\n\nMade by sammy007.
