It's suggested you run 8.16.0 using `nvm`.</sub>\n<br />\n<sub>**npm is NOT supported for package management. MyCrypto uses yarn.lock to ensure sub-dependency versions are pinned, so yarn is required to install node_modules</sub>\n<br />\n<sub>\\***Python 3 is **not** supported, since our dependencies use `node-gyp`.</sub>\n<br />\n<sub>\\***For users trying to build with WSL, you'll need to have install libpng via `sudo apt-get install libpng16-dev`.</sub>\n\n## Running the App\n\nFirst, you must run `yarn` to grab all the dependencies. If you are ever having trouble with something, a good place to start is by trying `rm -rf node_modules/ && yarn` which will completely clear all your previously installs dependencies and re-install them from scratch.\n\nThen, you can run various commands depending on what you want to do:\n\n#### Development\n\n```bash\n# run app in dev mode in browser, rebuild on file changes\nyarn start\n```\nA development server will be available on https://localhost:3000\nIf you're using Chrome, you will get a `net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` warning.\nTo disable it you can your settings in chrome: chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost\n\n\n```bash\n# run app in dev mode in electron, rebuild on file changes\nyarn dev:electron\n```\n\n"
