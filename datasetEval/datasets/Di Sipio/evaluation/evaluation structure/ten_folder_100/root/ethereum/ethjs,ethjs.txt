We need all the help we can get to build the absolute best linting standards and utilities. We follow the AirBNB linting standard and the unix philosophy.\n\n## Guides\n\nYou\'ll find more detailed information on using `ethjs` and tailoring it to your needs in our guides:\n\n- [User guide](docs/user-guide.md) - Usage, configuration, FAQ and complementary tools.\n- [Developer guide](docs/developer-guide.md) - Contributing to `ethjs` and writing your own code and coverage.\n- [Examples](http://github.com/ethjs/examples) - Examples of `ethjs` in use.\n\n## Help out\n\nThere is always a lot of work to do, and will have many rules to maintain. So please help out in any way that you can:\n\n- Create, enhance, and debug ethjs rules (see our guide to ["Working on rules"](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)).\n- Improve documentation.\n- Chime in on any open issue or pull request.\n- Open new issues about your ideas for making `ethjs` better, and pull requests to show us how your idea works.\n- Add new tests to *absolutely anything*.\n- Create or contribute to ecosystem tools.\n- Spread the word!\n\nPlease consult our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) docs before helping out.\n\nWe communicate via [issues](https://github.com/ethjs/ethjs/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/ethjs/ethjs/pulls).\n\n## Important documents\n\n- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)\n- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n- [License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethjs/ethjs/master/LICENSE)\n\n## Our Relationship with Ethereum & EthereumJS\n\nWe would like to mention that we are not in any way affiliated with the Ethereum Foundation. However, we love the work they do and work with them often to make Ethereum great! Our aim is to support the Ethereum ecosystem with a policy of diversity, modularity, simplicity, transparency, clarity, optimization and extensibility.\n\nMany of our modules use code from `web3.js` and the `ethereumjs-` repositories. We thank the authors where we can in the relevant repositories.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\n`ethjs` was built by a strong community of Ethereum developers. A special thanks to:\n\n- [Fabian Vogelsteller](https://twitter.com/feindura?lang=en) - for his work on `Mist` and `web3.js`\n- [Tim Coulter](https://github.com/tcoulter) - for his work on `TestRPC` and `Truffle`\n- [Aaron Davis](https://github.com/kumavis) - for his guidence and work on `MetaMask` and `ethereumjs`\n- [Richard Moore](https://github.com/ricmoo) - for his work on `ethers-io` and `ethers-wallet` from which so much of `ethjs` is build from\n- [Karl Floersch](https://twitter.com/karl_dot_tech?lang=en) - for his guidence and support\n- [Martin B.](https://github.com/wanderer) - for his work on `ethereumjs`\n- [Alex Beregszaszi](https://github.com/axic) - for his work on `ethereumjs`\n- [Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin) - for creating `Ethereum`\n\n## Licence\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT license, Copyright (c) 2016 Nick Dodson.
