Check out the [smart contracts](https://github.com/gitcoinco/smart_contracts).\n* __Web2__ This part of the app is built with Python, Django, Postgres, and a handful of other tools that are common in the web2 ecosystem.\n* __Web 3 Bridge__ This is the bridge between web3 and the rest of the application. Mostly built in javascript(web3js) and python(web3py).\n* __Brochureware__ Just a nice little landing page telling folks what the Gitcoin project is.\n\n# Developing\n\n## HTTPS API\n\n[For more information on the HTTPS API, please view the api README](https://docs.gitcoin.co/mk_rest_api/)\n\n## Running locally\n\n### With Docker (Recommended)\n\n[For more information on running the app locally, please view the documentation for running gitcoinco/web with Docker](https://docs.gitcoin.co/mk_setup/)\n\n### Without Docker\n\n[For more information on running the app locally, please view the documentation for running gitcoinco/web without Docker](https://docs.gitcoin.co/mk_alternative_setup/)\n\n## Overriding Application Defaults\n\n[For more information on overriding the local dev environment configuration defaults, please view the environment variables documentation](https://docs.gitcoin.co/mk_envvars/)\n\n# Trying out Gitcoin\n\n## Posting your first issue\n\nIf you\n\n* have some work on your Github Issues board that you don\'t have time (or skills) to do.\n* are dependant upon an upstream repo for something, and you\'d like to incentivize them to work on it.\n\ntry posting a funded issue at [https://gitcoin.co/new](https://gitcoin.co/new).\n\n# Integrating Gitcoin\n\nBasics\n\n* [Getting Started With Gitcoin](https://medium.com/gitcoin/getting-started-with-gitcoin-fa7149f2461a)\n* [Fund an Issue on Gitcoin](https://medium.com/gitcoin/fund-an-issue-on-gitcoin-3d7245e9b3f3)\n\nAdvanced\n\n* [Make a Contributor Friendly Repo](https://medium.com/gitcoin/how-to-build-a-contributor-friendly-project-927037f528d9)\n* [Set your OSS repos monetary policy](https://medium.com/gitcoin/setting-your-oss-repos-monetary-policy-9c493118cd34)\n* [Payout Several Contribs at Once](https://medium.com/gitcoin/payout-several-contributors-at-once-8742c13a8fdd)\n* [Crowdfund Bounties](https://medium.com/gitcoin/crowdfunding-bounties-fd821b04309d)\n* [Make a Gitcoin ENS Name](https://medium.com/gitcoin/personalize-your-own-gitcoin-ens-name-f8e5d7438e3e)\n\nBackground\n\n* [Everything you need to know about Gitcoin](https://medium.com/gitcoin/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gitcoin-fe2e3e292a21)\n* [Our Vision: Open Source Money will BUIDL the OSS Ecosystem](https://medium.com/gitcoin/open-source-money-will-buidl-the-open-source-ecosystem-f4169def8748)\n\nTestimonials & Case Studies\n\n* [Augur](https://medium.com/gitcoin/gitcoin-testimonials-augur-9bfe97368a30)\n* [Balance](https://medium.com/gitcoin/gitcoin-testimonials-balance-6d027fe01b9f)\n* [uPort](https://medium.com/gitcoin/gitcoin-testimonials-uport-1510222f3744)\n* [Ethereum Foundation](https://medium.com/gitcoin/gitcoin-testimonials-ethereum-foundation-web3py-py-evm-561cd4da92a6)\n* [Market Protocol](https://medium.com/gitcoin/gitcoin-testimonials-market-protocol-722dbb263d19)\n\n## Integrating the \'available work widget\' into your repository\n\nThis widget will help you advertise that you support Gitcoin bounties, so that your community knows the best place to contribute.\n\n[Check out the widget documentation to learn how](https://docs.gitcoin.co/mk_widget/)\n\n## Adding GitcoinBot to your repo\n\nGitcoinbot will allow you to add issues straight from github.\n\n[Check out the gitcoinbot readme to learn how](https://docs.gitcoin.co/mk_gitcoinbot/)\n\n## Adding your token to Gitcoin\n\nHave an ERC20 compatible token that you\'d like to use on the platform?
