b'# Python Implementation of the Ethereum protocol\n\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ethereum/py-evm](https://badges.gitter.im/ethereum/py-evm.svg)](https://gitter.im/ethereum/py-evm)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/py-evm/badge/?version=latest)](https://py-evm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n\n## Py-EVM\n\nPy-EVM is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol in Python. It contains the low level\nprimitives for the existing Ethereum 1.0 chain as well as emerging support for the upcoming\nEthereum 2.0 / Serenity spec.\n\n### Goals\n\nPy-EVM aims to eventually become the defacto Python implementation of the Ethereum protocol,\nenabling a wide array of use cases for both public and private chains. \n\nIn particular Py-EVM aims to:\n\n- be a reference implementation of the Ethereum 1.0 and 2.0 implementation in one of the most widely used and understood languages, Python.\n\n- be easy to understand and modifiable\n\n- have clear and simple APIs\n\n- come with solid, friendly documentation\n\n- deliver the low level primitives to build various clients on top (including *full* and *light* clients)\n\n- be highly flexible to support both research as well as alternate use cases like private chains.\n\n\n## Quickstart\n\n[Get started in 5 minutes](https://py-evm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/quickstart.html)\n\n## Documentation\n\nCheck out the [documentation on our official website](https://py-evm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## Want to help?\n\nWant to file a bug, contribute some code, or improve documentation?
