This includes the POA Network, xDai Chain, Ethereum Classic and other **Ethereum testnets, private networks and sidechains**.\n\nSee our [project documentation](https://docs.blockscout.com/) for detailed information and setup instructions.\n\nVisit the [POA BlockScout forum](https://forum.poa.network/c/blockscout) for FAQs, troubleshooting, and other BlockScout related items. You can also post and answer questions here.\n\nYou can also access the dev chatroom on our [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/poanetwork/blockscout).\n\n## About BlockScout\n\nBlockScout is an Elixir application that allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, and verify smart contracts on the Ethereum network including all forks and sidechains.\n\nCurrently available full-featured block explorers (Etherscan, Etherchain, Blockchair) are closed systems which are not independently verifiable.  As Ethereum sidechains continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate transactions.\n\n## Supported Projects\n\nBlockScout supports a number of projects. Hosted instances include POA Network, xDai Chain, Ethereum Classic, Sokol & Kovan testnets, and other EVM chains. \n\n- [List of hosted mainnets, testnets, and additional chains using BlockScout](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-projects/supported-projects)\n- [Hosted instance versions](https://docs.blockscout.com/about/use-cases/hosted-blockscout)\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nSee the [project documentation](https://docs.blockscout.com/) for instructions:\n- [Requirements](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/information-and-settings/requirements)\n- [Ansible deployment](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/ansible-deployment)\n- [Manual deployment](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/manual-deployment)\n- [ENV variables](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/information-and-settings/env-variables)\n- [Configuration options](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/configuration-options)\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank the [EthPrize foundation](http://ethprize.io/) for their funding support.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution and pull request protocol.
