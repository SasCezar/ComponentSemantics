To start\nauto-compiling the TypeScript code, you may use:\n\n```\n/home/ethers> npm run auto-build\n```\n\nA very important part of ethers is its exhaustive test cases, so before making any\nbug fix, please add a test case that fails prior to the fix, and succeeds after the\nfix. All regression tests must pass.\n\nPull requests are always welcome, but please keep a few points in mind:\n\n- Compatibility-breaking changes will not be accepted; they may be considered for the next major version\n- Security is important; adding dependencies require fairly convincing arguments\n- The library aims to be lean, so keep an eye on the `dist/ethers.min.js` file size before and after your changes\n- Add test cases for both expected and unexpected input\n- Any new features need to be supported by us (issues, documentation, testing), so anything that is overly complicated or specific may not be accepted\n\nIn general, **please start an issue before beginning a pull request**, so we can have a public discussion. :)\n\n\nDonations\n---------\n\nI do this because I love it, but if you want to buy me a coffee, I won\'t say no. **:o)**\n\nEthereum: `0xEA517D5a070e6705Cc5467858681Ed953d285Eb9`\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCompletely MIT Licensed.
