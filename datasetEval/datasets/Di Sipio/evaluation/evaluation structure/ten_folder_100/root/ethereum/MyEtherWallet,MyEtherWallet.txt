If monetization worsens the experience, we don\'t do it. (e.g. ads)\n- **A learning experience, too**: We want to educate about Ethereum, security, privacy, the importance of controlling your own keys, how the blockchain works, and how Ethereum and blockchain technologies enable a better world.\n- **If it can be hacked, it will be hacked**: Never save, store, or transmit secret info, like passwords or keys.\n- **Offline / Client-Side**: User should be able to run locally and offline without issue.\n- **Private**: No tracking!!! No emails. No ads. No demographics. We don\'t even know how many wallets have been generated, let alone who / what / where you are.\n- **Open source & auditable**\n\n## MEW Around the Web\n\n- [Website: https://www.myetherwallet.com/](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)\n- [CX: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/myetherwallet-cx/nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/myetherwallet-cx/nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm)\n- [Anti-phish CX](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn)\n- [FB: https://www.facebook.com/MyEtherWallet/](https://www.facebook.com/MyEtherWallet/)\n- [Twitter: https://twitter.com/myetherwallet](https://twitter.com/myetherwallet)\n- [Medium: https://medium.com/@myetherwallet](https://medium.com/@myetherwallet)\n- [Github MEW Repo: https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet)\n- [Github MEW Org: https://github.com/MyEtherWallet](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet)\n- [Github Latest Releases: https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/releases/latest](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/releases/latest)\n- [Github Anti-phish CX: https://github.com/409H/EtherAddressLookup](https://github.com/409H/EtherAddressLookup)\n- MEW ETH Donation Address: 0xDECAF9CD2367cdbb726E904cD6397eDFcAe6068D (mewtopia.eth)\n- MEW BTC Donation Address: 1DECAF2uSpFTP4L1fAHR8GCLrPqdwdLse9\n\n## Bug / Feature Request\n\nIf you find a bug, or want a new feature added, please submit it on the [Github Issues](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/issues)\n\n## Reporting a Vulnerability\n\n**Please do not file a public ticket** mentioning the vulnerability.\n\nTo find out how to disclose a vulnerability visit [hackerone.com/myetherwallet](https://hackerone.com/myetherwallet).\n\n## Getting started\n\n1.
