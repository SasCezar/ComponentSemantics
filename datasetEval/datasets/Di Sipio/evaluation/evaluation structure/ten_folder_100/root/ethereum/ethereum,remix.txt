Follow [this link](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide)!*\n\n+ [What is Remix?](#what-is-remix)\n+ [How to use Remix?](#how-to-use)\n+ [Modules](#modules)\n+ [Contributing guidelines](#contributing)\n\n## <a name="what-is-remix"></a>What is Remix?\n\n**Remix** is a suite of tools to interact with the Ethereum blockchain in order to debug transactions, stored in this Git repository. A Remix transaction Web debugger is available [here](http://remix.ethereum.org), and its source code is part of this repository.\n\nThe **Remix IDE** is an IDE for Solidity dApp developers, powered by Remix. The Remix IDE repository **is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide)**, and an online version is available at https://remix.ethereum.org.\n\nFor more, check out the [Remix documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n\n## <a name="how-to-use"></a>How to use Remix\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo use Remix tools, you\'ll need to connect to an Ethereum node. You can do that using [the Mist browser](https://github.com/ethereum/mist), or by connecting to your local Ethereum node (`geth`, or `eth`). *Note: connecting to `geth` does not work through https.*\n\n+ Using `geth`: `geth --rpc --rpcapi \'web3,eth,debug\' --rpcport 8545 --rpccorsdomain \'*\'`.\n\n+ Using `eth`: `eth -j --rpccorsdomain \'*\'`\n\n**DO NOT DO EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS IF `geth`/`eth` STORES YOUR PRIVATE KEYS**, as any external system might be able to access your node\'s RPC server!\n\nThose commands will run the RPC server on `localhost:8545`, which is the default URL that Remix will connect to. This instance should **only** be used for debugging purposes. Never use features that could have an impact on your keys: do not unlock any keys, do not use this instance together with the wallet, do not activate the admin `web3` API.\n\n### Run the debugger\n\nSee [here](remix-debugger/README.md) how to install, run and use the debugger locally.\n\nThe debugger itself contains several controls that allow stepping over the trace and seeing the current state of a selected step.\n\n## <a name="modules"></a>Remix Modules\n\nRemix is built out of several different modules:\n\n+ [`remix-analyzer`](remix-analyzer/README.md)\n+ [`remix-solidity`](remix-solidity/README.md) provides Solidity analysis and decoding functions.\n+ [`remix-lib`](remix-lib/README.md)\n+ [`remix-debug`](remix-debug/README.md) allo debuggin transaction.\n+ [`remix-tests`](remix-tests/README.md) provides unit testing for solidity.\n+ [`remix-astwalker`](remix-tests/README.md) provides a tool for parsing solidity AST.\n+ [`remix-url-resolver`](remix-url-resolver/README.md) provides helpers for resolving external content (github, swarm, ipfs, ...).\n+ [`remixd`](https://github.com/ethereum/remixd/tree/master) CLI which allow accessing local element from Remix IDE (see https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remixd.html)\n\nEach module generally has their own npm package and test suite, as well as basic documentation.\n\n## Contributing\n\nEveryone is very welcome to contribute on the codebase of Remix.
