Below are some notable token sales that we have used these contracts\n\n* `AppCoins <https://appcoins.io/>`_\n\n* `Civic <https://www.civic.com/>`_\n\n* `Storj <https://storj.io/>`_\n\n* `Monaco <https://mona.co/>`_\n\n* `DENT <https://dentcoin.com/>`_\n\n* `Ethos <https://www.ethos.io/>`_\n\n* `ixLedger <https://medium.com/ixledger>`_\n\n* ... and many more!\n\nWe also have third party token sales using these smart contracts\n\n* `Dala <https://github.com/GetDala/dala-smart-contracts>`_\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nTokenMarket can be a launch and hosting partner for your token sale. We offer advisory, legal, technical and marketing services. For more information see `TokenMarket fundraising services <https://tokenmarket.net/>`_. \n\nCommunity support is available on the best effort basis - your mileage may vary. To get the most of the community support we expect you to be on a senior level of Solidity, Python and open source development. `Meet us at the Gitter support chat <https://gitter.im/TokenMarketNet/ico>`_.\n\n\nAudit reports\n=============\n\nSome public audit reports available for some revisions of this codebase:\n\n* `For Atonomi by LevelK, May 2018 <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6r9uCgN_xpJeUdRaGxaQ3VrTVBiekg5V25aUEUycDVZWlhn/view?usp=sharing>`_\n\n* `For Dala by Iosiro, October 2017 <https://www.iosiro.com/dala-token-sale-audit>`_\n\n* `For Civic by Zeppelin, June 2017 <https://medium.com/@ZeppelinOrg/a91754ab6e4b>`_\n\nMore audit reports available on a request.\n\n'
