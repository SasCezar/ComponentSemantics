This can be fixed by disabling hardware acceleration like so:\n\n```sh\nmanta --disable-hardware-acceleration\n```\n\n> Remember that doing this might lead to some degradation of the app\'s performance. This is why "the fix" is not included by default.\n\n### Technologies\n* [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron)\n* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)\n* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)\n* [React-DnD](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd)\n* [React-Beautiful-DnD](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)\n* [React-Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion)\n* [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)\n\n\n### Why\nThe main reason I decided to build this is because I need a simple tool to create good looking invoices, estimates, and receipts but couldn\'t find one  that suits my needs. I don\'t do invoicing for a living but I do need it occasionally so an ideal invoicing app just needs to be good at one thing and one thing only, which is making invoices. I really don\'t need a full-fledged bookkeeping or accounting software.\n\nI believe there are many people such as freelance designers, developers, photographers or writers... also have such need. However, most (if not all) products I found have these these problems:\n\n**Complexity**\n\n* Most invoicing products nowadays is web-based, which means you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to maintain a new account (possible a monthly fee, too) just to create an invoice.\n* Sure, there some open-source products that can be self-hosted, but that will introduce a new layer of complexity to your workflow. Who will setup the product? Who will maintain the server? Who will cover the cost? ...\n* You will always need internet connection to be able to create your invoices. It can be slow sometimes.\n\n**Privacy**\n\n* When you use a web service, most of the time, you\xe2\x80\x99re giving away your data whether you want it or not. Financial data is sensitive and I believe that no one should know about your data except yourself.\n\n\n### Goals\nWith that in mind, I know that Manta would need to satisfy these criteria:\n\n* \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Fast!!!\n* \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d Friendly UI & UX\n* \xf0\x9f\x8e\x89 Has nice looking templates\n* \xf0\x9f\x94\x92 Does not touch user\xe2\x80\x99s data\n* \xf0\x9f\x92\xb0 Free! :)\n\n  If you think Manta delivers these, let me know by putting a star on this project \xf0\x9f\x98\x89\n\n### Development\n\nIt\'s very easy to get started with these 3 steps:\n\n* Clone this project to your local machine.\n* Open terminal and `cd` into the cloned folder, usually `cd Manta`.\n* Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.\n* Run `yarn dev` in one tab to start `webpack-dev-server`.\n* Run `yarn start` in another tab to open the app.\n\nThis is still in beta and it\'s far from perfect so feedbacks, issues or PRs are greatly appreciated! :)\n\nNote that on Linux you will need additional dependencies to provide the `icns2png` and `gm` commands.\nUbuntu/Debian users can run: `sudo apt install -y icnsutils graphicsmagick`.\n\n### FAQ\n\n* **Is this app built with Electron?**\n\nYes, it\'s built on top of [Electron](#). Please see the [Technologies](#technologies) section for more info.\n\n* **What boilerplate did you use**\n\nNone. This is my attempt to integrate Electron with React from scratch. The idea was to get a better understanding of how things work together, especially Webpack.\nBut I do take cue from other projects.\n\n* **What CSS/UI Framework did you use?**\n\nI wrote all the CSS myself. I only use Bootstrap for prototyping at first. But I gradually encapsulate most of the style to the component with the help of [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/). There is some places still use Bootstrap mostly for layout purpose but I\'ll get rid of it eventually.\n\n* **Where did you get the icons?**\n\n[ionicons](http://ionicons.com/). They\'re great!\n\n* **Why did you name the project Manta? It has nothing to do with invoicing.**\n\nIt\'s actually very common to associate an animal with your brand. There\'s a reason behind the Twitter bird, the famous MailChimp Freddy or the Docker whale ... It\'s called the Baby-Face bias. You can read more about it in the book [Designing for Emotion](https://abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion) by [Aaron Walter](http://aarronwalter.com/).\nIn my case, I was inspired by the movie [Racing Extinction](http://racingextinction.com/) and by naming this project Manta, I hope to raise people\'s awareness on some environmental issues mentioned in the movie. You can [read more about it here](https://getmanta.app/about/)\n\n* **I like Manta\'s logo, did you design it?**\n\nYes, I actually did all the illustrations as well as the templates that you see in the app.\n\n* **Are you available for hire?**\n\nYes, I\'m exploring new opportunities at the moment. Please let me know what you have in mind.\n\n* **How do I contact you?**\n\nIf you find an issue, please report it here. For everything else, please drop me a line at hi@getmanta.app\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nSpecial thanks to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) for providing [an open-source license](https://crowdin.com/page/open-source-project-setup-request) for Manta.
