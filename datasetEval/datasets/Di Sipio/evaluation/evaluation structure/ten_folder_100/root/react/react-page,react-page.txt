b'# React Page (formerly known as ORY editor)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/react-page/react-page.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/react-page/react-page)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/ory-am/editor/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/ory/editor?branch=master)\n[![Docs Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-guide-blue.svg)](https://ory.gitbooks.io/editor/content/)\n\nReact Page is a smart, extensible and modern editor ("WYSIWYG") for the web written in React. If you are fed up with the limitations of `contenteditable`, you are in the right place.\n\n<img width="60%" alt="React Page Demo" src="docs/images/quick-example.gif">\n\n### Bundle Size\n\nWe try to keep the initial bundle size low so that you can use this library also to render the content statically without edit functionality.\n\nWe achieve that by lazy-loading using `import()` functions. Most modern bundlers like webpack (e.g. in nextjs) support this kind of lazy loading. So the default editor-ui (based on material-ui) is only loaded if the editor is in editMode.\n\nYou can additionally use `@react-page/renderer` to have a minimal renderer.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe docs can be found inside the docs folder of this project.\n\nYou can follow the [Quick Start](./docs/quick-start.md) to get the basic editor running on your project.\n\nA list of some packages and tools that we provide can be found [here](./docs/packages.md), check this file to see what you can accomplish with this editor.\n\nFinally you can check the rest of the docs [here](./docs/SUMMARY.md)\n\nWe also provide docummentations for all of the public api methods, the docs are available [here](./docs/api)\n\n(currently outdated, sorry! )\n\n## Attributions\n\nFormely known as ORY Editor\n\nOriginal Library created by [@aeneasr](https://github.com/aeneasr) [@ory](https://github.com/ory)\n\n[![Follow twitter](https://img.shields.io/badge/follow-twitter-00cc99.svg)](https://twitter.com/_aeneasr)\n[![Follow GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/follow-github-00cc99.svg)](https://github.com/arekkas)\n\n## Community\n\njoin us on slack: https://reactpage.slack.com\n'
