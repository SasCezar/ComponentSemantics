Main principles of Recharts are:\n\n1. **Simply** deploy with React components.\n1. **Native** SVG support, lightweight depending only on some D3 submodules.\n1. **Declarative** components, components of charts are purely presentational.\n\n## Examples\n\n```jsx\n<LineChart\n  width={400}\n  height={400}\n  data={data}\n  margin={{ top: 5, right: 20, left: 10, bottom: 5 }}\n>\n  <XAxis dataKey="name" />\n  <Tooltip />\n  <CartesianGrid stroke="#f5f5f5" />\n  <Line type="monotone" dataKey="uv" stroke="#ff7300" yAxisId={0} />\n  <Line type="monotone" dataKey="pv" stroke="#387908" yAxisId={1} />\n</LineChart>\n```\n\nAll the components of Recharts are clearly separated. The lineChart is composed of x axis, tooltip, grid, and line items, and each of them is an independent React Component. The clear separation and composition of components is one of the principle Recharts follows.\n\n## Installation\n\n### npm\n\nNPM is the easiest and fastest way to get started using Recharts. It is also the recommended installation method when building single-page applications (SPAs). It pairs nicely with a CommonJS module bundler such as Webpack.\n\n\n```sh\n# latest stable\n$ npm install recharts\n```\n\n### umd\n\nThe UMD build is also available on unpkg.com:\n\n```html\n <script src="https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>\n <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>\n <script src="https://unpkg.com/prop-types/prop-types.min.js"></script>\n <script src="https://unpkg.com/recharts/umd/Recharts.min.js"></script>\n```\n\nThen you can find the library on `window.Recharts`.\n\n### dev build\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/recharts/recharts.git\n$ cd recharts\n$ npm install\n$ npm run build\n```\n\n## Demo\n\nTo examine the demos in your local build, execute:\n\n```sh\n$ npm run[-script] demo\n```\n\nand then browse to http://localhost:3000.\n\n## Module Formats\n\n- [babel-plugin-recharts](https://github.com/recharts/babel-plugin-recharts) A simple transform to cherry-pick Recharts modules so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to.\n\n## Contribution\n\nWe\'d love :heart: to hear what you think we should build. Please create an issue to write your usage or ideas.\n\nWe are looking for like-minded people who share the same idea about Recharts. The goal of this project is create a more flexible charting library for the  React community.\n\n## Sponsoring\n\nMost of the core team members do this open source work in their free time. If you use recharts for a important work, and you\'d like us to invest more time on it, please [donate](https://opencollective.com/recharts#sponsors).
