For the best experience, though, you\'ll want to try a [native build](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/wiki/Building-&-Installing).\n\n## Motivation\n\nToday, [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is one of the most popular tools for building desktop apps - using an HTML, JS, CSS stack. However, it has a heavy footprint in terms of both RAM and CPU - __essentially packing an entire browser into the app.__ Even with that tradeoff, it has a lot of great aspects - it\'s the quickest way to build a cross-platform app & it provides a great development experience - as can be testified by its usage in popular apps like VSCode, Discord, and Slack.\n\nRevery is kind of like super-fast, _native code_ Electron - with bundled React-like/Redux-like libraries and a fast build system - all ready to go!\n\nRevery is built with [reasonml](https://reasonml.github.io), which is a javascript-like syntax on top of [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) This means that the language is accessible to JS developers.\n\nYour apps are compiled to native code with the Reason / OCaml toolchain - with __instant startup__ and __performance comparable to native C code.__ Revery features platform-accelerated, GPU-accelerated rendering. The compiler itself is fast, too!\n\nRevery is an experiment - can we provide a great developer experience and help teams be productive, without making sacrifices on performance?\n\n### Design Decisions\n\n- __Consistent cross-platform behavior__\n\nA major value prop of Electron is that you can build for all platforms at once. You have great confidence as a developer that your app will look and work the same across different platforms. Revery is the same - aside from platform-specific behavior, if your app looks or behaves differently on another platform, that\'s a bug! As a consequence, Revery is like [flutter](https://flutter.io) in that it __does not use native widgets__. This means more work for us, but also that we have more predictable functionality cross-platform!\n\n> __NOTE:__ If you\'re looking for something that does leverage native widgets, check out [briskml](https://github.com/briskml/brisk). Another alternative is the [cuite](https://github.com/let-def/cuite) OCaml binding for [Qt](https://github.com/let-def/cuite).\n\n- __High performance__\n\nPerformance should be at the forefront, and not a compromise - we need to develop and build benchmarks that help ensure top-notch performance and start-up time.\n\n- __Type-safe, functional code__\n\nWe might have some dirty mutable objects for performance - but our high-level API should be purely functional. You should be able to follow the React model of modelling your UI as a _pure function_ of application state -> UI.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- Check out [revery-quick-start](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery-quick-start) to get up and running with your own Revery app!\n- Try out our [interactive playground](https://www.outrunlabs.com/revery/playground/)\n- Read through our [docs](https://www.outrunlabs.com/revery/api/revery/)\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe\'d love your help, and welcome PRs and contributions.\n\nSome ideas for getting started:\n- [Build and run](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/wiki/Building-&-Installing) Revery\n- View our [Roadmap](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/wiki/Roadmap)\n- Help us improve our [documentation](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/blob/master/src/index.mld)\n- Help us build [examples](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/tree/master/examples)\n- Help us [fix bugs](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3A%22bug%22) and [build features](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22++-label%3Abug)\n- Help us [log bugs and open issues](https://github.com/bryphe/revery/issues/new)\n- Support the project on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/revery)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/reveryui) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/UvQ2cFn)!\n\n## License\n\nRevery is provided under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\nRevery bundles several dependencies under their own license terms - please refer to [ThirdPartyLicenses.txt](./ThirdPartyLicenses.txt).\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to everyone who has [contributed](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/graphs/contributors) to Revery!\n\n## Backers\n\nThank you to all our backers! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f [[Become a backer](https://opencollective.com/revery#backer)]\n\n<a href="https://opencollective.com/revery#backers" target="_blank"><img src="https://opencollective.com/revery/backers.svg?width=890"></a>\n\n## Built with Revery\n\n<p align="left">\n  <a href="https://v2.onivim.io/">\n    <img src="./assets/onivim-logo.png" alt="Onivim 2" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n\n## Special Thanks\n\n`revery` would not be possible without a bunch of cool tech:\n- [ocaml](https://ocaml.org) made these tools possible - thanks [Inria](http://gallium.inria.fr/) & [OCaml Labs](http://ocamllabs.io/)!\n- [reasonml](https://reasonml.github.io) made revery possible - thanks @jordwalke!\n- [flex](https://github.com/jordwalke/flex) by @jordwalke\n- [briskml](https://github.com/briskml)\n    - [brisk-reconciler](https://github.com/briskml/brisk-reconciler) - the "native React" implementation.\n- [reason-sdl2](https://github.com/revery-ui/reason-sdl2)\n    - [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org)\n    - [stb-image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)\n- [reason-fontkit](https://github.com/bryphe/reason-fontkit)\n    - [freetype2](https://www.freetype.org)\n    - [harfbuzz](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz)\n- [reason-gl-matrix](https://github.com/bryphe/reason-gl-matrix)\n    - [gl-matrix](http://glmatrix.net)\n    - [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html)\n- [@reason-native/console](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/reason-native/tree/master/src/console)\n\n`revery` was inspired by some __awesome projects:__\n- [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)\n- [ReactMini](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/tree/master/ReactMini)\n- [cuite](https://github.com/let-def/cuite)\n- [wall](https://github.com/let-def/wall)\n- [elm](https://elm-lang.org/)\n- [reprocessing](https://github.com/Schmavery/reprocessing)\n'
