Bug reports occurring on older versions will not be looked at quickly.\n\n### Have you considered sending a pull request instead of filing an issue?\nThe best way to report a bug is to provide the TestNG team with a full test case reproducing the issue.\nMaybe you can write a runnable test case (check the `src/test/` folder for examples) and propose it in a pull request \nDon't worry if the CI fails because it is the expected behavior.\nThis pull request will be a perfect start to find the fix :)\n\n### How to create a pull request?\nRefer our [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) section for detailed set of steps.\n\n### We encourage pull requests that:\n\n  * Add new features to TestNG (or)\n  * Fix bugs in TestNG\n\n  If your pull request involves fixing SonarQube issues then we would suggest that you please discuss this with the \n  [TestNG-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/testng-dev) before you spend time working on it.\n"
