b'# Package for equality of Go values\n\n[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp?status.svg)][godoc]\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/go-cmp.svg?branch=master)][travis]\n\nThis package is intended to be a more powerful and safer alternative to\n`reflect.DeepEqual` for comparing whether two values are semantically equal.\n\nThe primary features of `cmp` are:\n\n* When the default behavior of equality does not suit the needs of the test,\n  custom equality functions can override the equality operation.\n  For example, an equality function may report floats as equal so long as they\n  are within some tolerance of each other.\n\n* Types that have an `Equal` method may use that method to determine equality.\n  This allows package authors to determine the equality operation for the types\n  that they define.\n\n* If no custom equality functions are used and no `Equal` method is defined,\n  equality is determined by recursively comparing the primitive kinds on both\n  values, much like `reflect.DeepEqual`. Unlike `reflect.DeepEqual`, unexported\n  fields are not compared by default; they result in panics unless suppressed\n  by using an `Ignore` option (see `cmpopts.IgnoreUnexported`) or explicitly\n  compared using the `AllowUnexported` option.\n\nSee the [GoDoc documentation][godoc] for more information.\n\nThis is not an official Google product.\n\n[godoc]: https://godoc.org/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/google/go-cmp\n\n## Install\n\n```\ngo get -u github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp\n```\n\n## License\n\nBSD - See [LICENSE][license] file\n\n[license]: https://github.com/google/go-cmp/blob/master/LICENSE\n'
