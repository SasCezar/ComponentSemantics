b'# Welcome, friend\n\nmountebank is the only open source service virtualization tool that competes with the commercial offerings\nin terms of protocol diversity, capability, and performance. Here\'s what\n[Capital One wrote](https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/moving-one-of-capital-ones-largest-customer-facing-apps-to-aws-668d797af6fc)\nabout their mobile cloud migration (emphasis theirs):\n\n>In fact, halfway through we discovered our corporate mocking software couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle the\n>sheer amount of performance testing we were running as part of this effort (_we completely crushed\n>some pretty industrial enterprise software in the process_). As a result, we made the call to move\n>the entire program over to a Mountebank OSS-based solution with a custom provision to give us the ability\n>to expand/shrink our mocking needs on demand.\n\nAt the moment, the following protocols are supported:\n* http\n* https\n* tcp (text and binary)\n* smtp\n\nmountebank supports mock verification, stubbing with advanced predicates, JavaScript injection,\nand record-playback through proxying. It also supports extensions that allow you to build custom\nprotocol implementations in the language of your choice.\n\n![how it works](https://github.com/bbyars/mountebank/blob/master/src/public/images/overview.gif?raw=true)\n\nSee [getting started](https://www.mbtest.org/docs/gettingStarted) guide for more information.\n\n## Install and Run\n\nInstall:\n\n    npm install -g mountebank\n\nBillions of other install options are [also available](https://www.mbtest.org/docs/install) with no platform dependencies.\n\nRun:\n\n    mb\n\nThere are a number of [command line options](https://www.mbtest.org/docs/commandLine) if you need\nto customize mountebank.\n\n## Learn More\n\nAfter installing and running, view the docs in your browser at <http://localhost:2525>, or visit the\n[public site](https://www.mbtest.org/).\n\nYou can always learn more and support mountebank development by buying the book:\n\n[![Testing Microservices with Mountebank](https://github.com/bbyars/mountebank/blob/master/src/public/images/book.jpg)](https://www.manning.com/books/testing-microservices-with-mountebank?a_aid=mb&a_bid=ee3288f4)\n\n## Goals\n\nmountebank has the following goals:\n\n* Trivial to get started\n  * mountebank is easy to install, without any platform dependencies.  mountebank aims for fun and comprehensive\n     documentation with lots of examples, and a nice UI that lets you explore the API interactively.\n* A platform, not just a tool\n  * mountebank aims to be fully cross-platform, with native language bindings.  Servers are extensible through scripting.\n* Powerful\n  * mountebank is the only open source stubbing tool that is non-modal and multi-protocol.  Commercial\n    "service virtualization" solutions exist, but their licensed platforms make it hard to move the tests\n    closer to development and can even require a specialized IDE.  mountebank provides service virtualization free\n    of charge without any platform constraints.\n\nNot all of mountebank\'s goals are currently implemented, but fear not, for he has a team of top-notch open\nsource developers, and they are legion.\n\n## Roadmap and Support\n\nmountebank is used by a large number of companies and I think it\'s important to convey my best guess as to what\nthe feature roadmap is. I\'ve adopted GitHub tools to manage the roadmap. Specifically, the\n[Roadmap project](https://github.com/bbyars/mountebank/projects/9) page shows the features by release. I generally\nre-prioritize and update the ETAs each release.\n\nVisit the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mountebank-discuss)\nfor any support questions.  Don\'t be shy!\n\nmountebank is provided free of charge and maintained in my free time. As such, I\'m unable to make any kind\nof guarantees around either support turn-around time or release dates. If your company has commitments\nthat require more confidence and are willing to pay a reasonable services fee to obtain that confidence,\nyou can contact me directly at brandon.byars@gmail.com.\n\n## Build Status\n\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/bbyars/mountebank.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/bbyars/mountebank)\n[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/bbyars/mountebank.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)\n[![Test Coverage][codeclimate-coverage-badge]][codeclimate-coverage]\n[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/c030a6aebe274e21b4ce11a74e01fa12)](https://www.codacy.com/app/brandonbyars/mountebank?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=bbyars/mountebank&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)\n[![Code Climate][codeclimate-badge]][codeclimate]\n\nFor cross-OS compatibility, mountebank uses [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/bbyars/mountebank),\n[Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bbyars/mountebank), and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/bbyars/mountebank).\nOnly CircleCI runs on commit (TravisCI and Appveyor are triggered in the CircleCI pipeline), and you can view the success of the TravisCI\nand Appveyor builds in [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/bbyars/mountebank) as the "osx" and "windows" jobs, respectively.\n\n## Building\n\n`./build` should do the trick on Mac and Linux, and `build.bat` on Windows, assuming you have a supported version\nof node. If not, yell at me.\n\nThere are some tests that require network access (`grunt airplane` ignores them in case that offends your\nmoral sensibilities).  A few of these tests verify the correct behavior under DNS failures.  If your ISP\nis kind enough to hijack the NXDOMAIN DNS response in an attempt to allow you to conveniently peruse their\nadvertising page, those tests will fail.  I suggest that, under such circumstances, you talk to your ISP\nand let them know that their policies are causing mountebank tests to fail. You can also run `grunt airplane`,\nwhich will avoid tests requiring your DNS resolver.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!\nSome tips for contributing are in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bbyars/mountebank/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\nWhile I\'ve done my best to maintain a healthy codebase, mountebank is now several years old, If you\'re interested in\ncontributing but need some pointers to understand the code, feel free to reach me at brandon.byars@gmail.com.\n\n[npm-badge]: https://nodei.co/npm/mountebank.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mountebank\n[codeclimate-badge]: https://codeclimate.com/github/bbyars/mountebank/badges/gpa.svg\n[codeclimate]: https://codeclimate.com/github/bbyars/mountebank\n[codeclimate-coverage-badge]: https://codeclimate.com/github/bbyars/mountebank/badges/coverage.svg\n[codeclimate-coverage]: https://codeclimate.com/github/bbyars/mountebank/coverage\n[travis-badge]: https://travis-ci.org/bbyars/mountebank.png\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/bbyars/mountebank\n[appveyor-badge]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/acfhg44px95s4pk5?svg=true\n[appveyor]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bbyars/mountebank\n'
