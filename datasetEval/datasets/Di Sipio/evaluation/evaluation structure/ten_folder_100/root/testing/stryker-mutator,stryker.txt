This is where all official stryker packages are maintained.\nIf you're new to monorepos: don't be scared. You'll find the packages in the `packages` folder.\n\nIf you're interested in why we chose a monorepo, please read [babeljs's design document about monorepos](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md). We use it for the same reasons as they do.\n\n## Introduction\n\nFor an introduction to mutation testing and Stryker's features, see [stryker-mutator.io](https://stryker-mutator.io/).\n\n## Getting started\n\nFor the quickstart, see [quickstart](https://stryker-mutator.io/quickstart.html).\n\n## Usage\n\nFor details on the `stryker run` command and others, see [stryker's readme](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/core#readme)\n\n## Configuration\n\nSee the [stryker's package readme](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/blob/master/packages/core/README.md#configuration) for all config options.\n\n## Supported mutators\n\nSee our website for the [list of currently supported mutators](https://stryker-mutator.io/mutators.html).\n\n"
