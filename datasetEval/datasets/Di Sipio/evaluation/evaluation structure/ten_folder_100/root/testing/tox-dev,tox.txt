The report at\nthe end summarizes which ``testenvs`` have failed and which have\nsucceeded.\n\n**Note:** To learn more about what you can do with tox, have a look at\n[the collection of examples in the\ndocumentation](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html)\nor [existing projects using\ntox](https://github.com/search?l=INI&q=tox.ini+in%3Apath&type=Code).\n\n### How it works\n\ntox creates virtual environments for all configured so called\n``testenvs``, it then installs the project and other necessary\ndependencies and runs the configured set of commands.
