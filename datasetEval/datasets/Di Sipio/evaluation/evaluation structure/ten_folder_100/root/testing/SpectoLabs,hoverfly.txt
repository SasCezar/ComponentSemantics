Using Hoverfly, you can create realistic simulations of the APIs your application depends on.\n\n* Replace slow, flaky API dependencies with realistic, re-usable simulations\n* Simulate network latency, random failures or rate limits to test edge-cases\n* Extend and customize with any programming language\n* Export, share, edit and import API simulations\n* CLI and native language bindings for [Java](https://hoverfly-java.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n* REST API\n* Lightweight, high-performance, run anywhere\n* Apache 2 license\n\nHoverfly is developed and maintained by [SpectoLabs](https://specto.io).\n\n## Quickstart\n\n* [Download and installation](https://hoverfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/introduction/downloadinstallation.html)\n* [Read the docs](https://hoverfly.readthedocs.io)\n* [Join the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/specto.io/forum/#!forum/hoverfly)\n\n## Hoverfly Cloud\n\nHoverfly Cloud - API simulations as a service. [Sign up here.](https://hoverfly.io/hoverfly-cloud)\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!\n\nTo contribute, please:\n\n1. Fork the repository\n1. Create a feature branch on your fork\n1. Commit your changes, and create a pull request against Hoverfly's master branch\n1. In your pull request, include details regarding your change, i.e\n    1. why you made it\n    1. how to test it\n    1. any information about testing you have performed\n\nTo read more about forking model, check out this link: [forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow).\n\n\n## Setup for local development\n\n### Build\n1. Install Go. You should follow the download and installation instructions for your OS from [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl). If you have installed Go before \nusing either `apt-get` or `homebrew`, you should uninstall those first.\n1. After the installation, find out the `GOPATH` using `go env`, and then setup a source folder there\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir $GOPATH/src\n    ```\n1. Clone the hoverfly project into your Go source folder:\n    ```bash\n    cd $GOPATH/src\n    mkdir -p github.com/SpectoLabs/\n    cd github.com/SpectoLabs/\n    git clone https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly.git\n    # or: git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/hoverfly.git\n    ```\n1. Finally you can run the build\n\n    ```bash\n    cd hoverfly\n    make build \n    ```\n\nNotice the binaries are in the ``target`` directory.\n\n\n### Test\n\nYou should be able to execute all unit and functional tests with: \n\n```bash\nmake test\n```\n\nSome middleware tests may fail if you don't have `ruby` and `python` setup in your environment. If you are using Mac, you can install them with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n```bash\nbrew install ruby\nbrew install python\n``` \n\n\n## License\n\nApache License version 2.0 [See LICENSE for details](https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n(c) [SpectoLabs](https://specto.io) 2017.\n\n[CircleCI-Image]: https://circleci.com/gh/SpectoLabs/hoverfly.svg?style=shield\n[CircleCI-Url]: https://circleci.com/gh/SpectoLabs/hoverfly\n"
