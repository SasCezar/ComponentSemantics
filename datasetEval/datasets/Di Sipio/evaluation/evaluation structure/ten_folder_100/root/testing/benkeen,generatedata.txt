b'# generatedata.com\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benkeen/generatedata.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benkeen/generatedata)\n\nThis is the repo for the downloadable version of [generatedata.com](http://www.generatedata.com). The \nscript is basically an *engine* to generate any sort of random data in any format. It currently comes with 30 or \nso *Data Types* (types of data it generates), plus 8 *Export Types* (formats for the data), but it can be extended \nin any way you want. Check out the [developer documentation](http://benkeen.github.io/generatedata/developer.html)\nfor that. If you need to generate random data programmatically rather than manually via the UI, you can use the [REST API](http://benkeen.github.io/generatedata/api.html).\n\nGenerally the trunk is pretty stable, but it\'s not guaranteed. If you\'re downloading the script, get the most recent \ntag: https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/releases\n\n## Requirements\n- PHP 5.3 or any later version of PHP 5.\n- MySQL 4.1.3 or later\n\n## How to Install / Documentation\n\nFor installation instructions, user and developer documentation, check out:\nhttp://benkeen.github.io/generatedata/\n\nInstallation is really, really simple. I deliberately wrote the script to be as self-contained as possible and not \nrequire additional PHP/Server configuration when setting it up. That said, it *does* require PHP 5.3.0 or later. See \nthe documentation for more info.\n\n## `master` = v4 rewrite\n\nThe master branch of this repo now contains the ongoing work for the v4 rewrite. The generatedata.com site, the \ndocumentation and everything else is for up to the v3 branch. You can find that code in the `v3` branch. \n\nAlthough I\'m no longer working on that branch, PRs and bug fixes are very welcome! Just branch off `v3` and put \nyour PRs in against that.\n\n\n## Pre-packaged solutions\n\n### Docker\n\n- Check out [Maxime Visonneau\'s repo](https://github.com/mvisonneau/docker-generatedata) for a Docker packaged version \nof this script.\n- Also: [@LaiNathaniel\'s repo](https://github.com/LaiNathaniel/docker-generatedata)\n- And [Andy Shinn\'s instructions](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/pull/269)\n\n\n### Vagrant \nThere\'s also a pre-packaged Vagrant solution [found here](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata-vagrant),\ncourtesy of Daragh Courtney.\n\n\n# Test Coverage\n\nTest coverage is pretty weak right now! I\'m in the midst of adding phpunit tests and integrating it with Travis, but it\'s\ngoing to be a little hairy for a while just yet.\n\n## To-Do\n\nPlease see the issues tagges as [feature requests](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/issues?labels=Feature+Request%21&page=1&state=open)\nfor a list of things that are still left to complete on this project. Help is always welcome!\n\n## License\n\nThis script is freely available under the GPL 3 license. See license.txt in the root folder.
