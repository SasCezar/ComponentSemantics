It's used by the jQuery\nproject to test its code and plugins but is capable of testing any generic\nJavaScript code (and even capable of testing JavaScript code on the server-side).\n\nQUnit is especially useful for regression testing: Whenever a bug is reported,\nwrite a test that asserts the existence of that particular bug. Then fix it and\ncommit both. Every time you work on the code again, run the tests. If the bug\ncomes up again - a regression - you'll spot it immediately and know how to fix\nit, because you know what code you just changed.\n\nHaving good unit test coverage makes safe refactoring easy and cheap. You can\nrun the tests after each small refactoring step and always know what change\nbroke something.\n\nQUnit is similar to other unit testing frameworks like JUnit, but makes use of\nthe features JavaScript provides and helps with testing code in the browser, such as built in support for asynchronicity and exception handling.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you need help using QUnit, visit the [QUnit and Testing forum](https://forum.jquery.com/qunit-and-testing) or chat with us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/qunitjs/qunit).\n\nIf you believe there is a bug with QUnit or would like to request a new feature, [open an issue](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues).\n\n## Development / Contributions\n\nIf you are interested in helping develop QUnit, check out our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n"
