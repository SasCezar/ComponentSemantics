It brings the ability of compiled languages such as [**D**](https://dlang.org/spec/unittest.html) / [**Rust**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch11-00-testing.html) / [**Nim**](https://nim-lang.org/docs/unittest.html) to have tests written directly in the production code thanks to a fast, transparent and flexible test runner with a clean interface.\n\n[![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%2B%2B-11/14/17/20-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n[![Version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/onqtam%2Fdoctest.svg)](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/releases)\n[![download](https://img.shields.io/badge/download%20%20-link-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onqtam/doctest/master/doctest/doctest.h)\n[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/503/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/503)\n[![Language grade: C/C++](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/grade/cpp/g/onqtam/doctest.svg)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/onqtam/doctest/context:cpp)\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/onqtam/doctest](https://badges.gitter.im/onqtam/doctest.svg)](https://gitter.im/onqtam/doctest?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n[![Try it online](https://img.shields.io/badge/try%20it-online-orange.svg)](https://wandbox.org/permlink/3J7otx2TvFQNSZsb)\n<!--\n[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C++-blue.svg)](https://isocpp.org/)\n[![documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/documentation%20%20-online-blue.svg)](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/readme.md#reference)\n-->\n\n[<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8225057/5990484/70413560-a9ab-11e4-8942-1a63607c0b00.png" align="right">](http://www.patreon.com/onqtam)\n\nThe framework is and will stay free but needs your support to sustain its development.
