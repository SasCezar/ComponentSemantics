It\'s being developed privately currently. We welcome any and all improvements or pull requests. If you\'d like to take a look at the source, you can clone the `beta` branch and take a look at that. This project is under active development, so everything will change. If you want to submit a pull request with any improvements, feel free. I make no guarantees about the usability of anything in this project.\n\nFull Disclaimer: We are not related to Nintendo in any way, and hold none of their copyright, intellectual property, and make otherwise no claims to any assets belonging to Game Freak.\n## Demo and Downloads\n\nThere are examples for Windows, Linux, and Mac zipped in [Releases](https://github.com/PokemonUnity/PokemonUnity/releases)! These are very old and need to be updated, however. They show the state at which the engine was originally abandoned, and we\'ve been hard at work since.\n\n## External Links\n\n* Reddit: <https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonUnity/>\n* Discord server: <https://discord.gg/CCF2YVP>\n* Documentation: <https://pokemonunity.gitbooks.io/pokemon-unity/content/>\n'
