b"Steamworks.NET\n=======\n\n_Steamworks.NET_ is a C# Wrapper for Valve's Steamworks API, it can be used either with Unity or your C# based Application.\n\n_Steamworks.NET_ was designed to be as close as possible to the original C++ API, as such the documentation provided from Valve largely covers usage of _Steamworks.NET_.\nNiceties and C# Idioms can be easily implemented on top of _Steamworks.NET_.\n\n_Steamworks.NET_ currently fully supports Windows, OSX, and Linux in both 32 and 64bit varieties. Currently building against Steamworks SDK 1.46.\n\n* Author: [Riley Labrecque](https://github.com/rlabrecque)\n* License: [MIT](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n* [Documentation](https://steamworks.github.io/)\n* [Discussion Thread](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/discussions/0/666827974770212954/)\n* [Reporting Issues](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/issues)\n* 1-on-1 support is available by donating $100 USD or greater.\n * Support can be obtained via [Email](mailto:support@rileylabrecque.com), [Skype](http://rileylabrecque.com/skype), or [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/rlabrecque)\n * I can only help with Steamworks.NET specific issues, general API questions should be asked on the [Steamworks discussion board](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/discussions).\n\n[![Support via Paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YFZZER8VNXKRC)\n\n\n[Installation Instructions](http://steamworks.github.io/installation/)\n-----\n\nSamples\n-----\nCheck out these sample projects to get started:\n* [Steamworks.NET Example](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET-Example)\n* [Steamworks.NET Test](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET-Test)\n* [Steamworks.NET ChatClient](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET-ChatClient)\n* [Steamworks.NET GameServerTest](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET-GameServerTest)\n"
