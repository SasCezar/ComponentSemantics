It's designed as an single module without any third party dependencies.\n   \n* *uTinyRipperGUI*\n\n   Basic graphic interface application. It has some extra converters, so additionally it export:\n   * AudioClip .wav export\n   * Texture2D .png export (with Sprites)\n   * Shader DirectX blob export\n   * References to build-in Engine assets\n   \n* *uTinyRipperConsole* and *uTinyRipperConsoleNETCore*\n\n   Sample console application which is designed to test Core library functionality.   \n   It is command line console application. Drag and drop resource file(s) or/and folder(s) onto .exe to retrive assets. It will automaticly try to find resource dependencies, create 'Ripped' folder and extract all supported assets into created directory.\n   As it is a sample application so I'm not going to improve it in any way.\n\n\n\n### Requirements:\n\nIf you want to build a solution, you need:\n\n \\- .NET Framework 4.6.0 + .NET Standard 1.3 + .NET Core 1.0 SDK\n\n \\- Compiler with C# 7.3 syntax support (Visual Studio 2017)\n\n\nIf you want to run binary files, you need to install:\n\n \\- [.NET Framework 4.6.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48137)\n \n \\- [Microsoft Visual C++ 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784) and [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53840) Redistributables\n\n \\- [Unity 2017.3.0f3 or greater](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) (NOTE: editor version must be no less than game version)\n "
