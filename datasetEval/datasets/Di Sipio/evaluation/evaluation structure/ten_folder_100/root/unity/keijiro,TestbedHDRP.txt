I\'m just trying to explore the possibilities of the new\nfeatures.\n\n[Unity HDRP]: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ScriptableRenderPipeline/wiki/High-Definition-Render-Pipeline-overview\n\nSystem requirements\n-------------------\n\n- Unity 2018.3 or later\n\nThis project uses [Git support on Package Manager] to import external packages.\nTo enable the functionality, [Git] must be installed on the system. See\n[the forum thread][Git support on Package Manager] for futher details.\n\n[Git support on Package Manager]:\n    https://forum.unity.com/threads/git-support-on-package-manager.573673/\n[Git]: https://git-scm.com/downloads\n\n<!--4567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456-->\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\n- The statues models used in the examples were scanned by Geoffrey Marchal.
