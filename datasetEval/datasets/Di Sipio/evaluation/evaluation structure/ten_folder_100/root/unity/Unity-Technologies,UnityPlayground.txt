b'# Unity Playground\n\n![playground.png](https://imgur.com/NvAFtsp.jpg)\n\n**This project can be found and downloaded on the Asset Store**\n\n## Description\n\nA collection of simple scripts to create 2D physics games, intended for giving workshops to an audience of beginner game developers to quickly enable them to make games in Unity.\n\n## Documentation\n\n**Objective**\n\nThis project is intended to be as flexible as possible, not enforcing a specific game genre apart from the obvious constraints of being 2D and physics-powered. It contains a lot of scripts that perform _atomic_ tasks, that is they do mostly only one thing, so you can combine them to create _any kind_ of gameplay.\n\nThat said, the audience should already have an idea of how Unity works, the Editor interface, the concept of GameObjects, Components, the Scene View, Play Mode, and so forth. It might be useful to guide them through these concepts before letting them play with this project.\n\n**Usage instructions**\n\nDocumentation can be found in pdf form under Assets/Documentation\n\n**Software Requirements**\n\nRequired: Any Unity 2017.4 or later version\n\n**Hardware Requirements**\n\nRequired: Laptop\n\n**Change Log**\n\n- **1.0** _(2018/12/12)_ - initial release on the Asset Store.\n'
