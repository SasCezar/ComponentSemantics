Tested on Windows, WebGL, Android and iOS.\n\nThere are several ways to install Procedural Toolkit:\n\n### Package Manager\nThe best way is to install this library as a [Git package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-git.html) using the Package Manager.\nFirst, make sure that you to have Git installed and available in your system\'s PATH.\nAfter that you need to add the following line to your project\'s `manifest.json`:\n```"com.syomus.proceduraltoolkit": "https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit.git",```\n\nIt should look like this, notice the comma at the end of the line:\n```\n{\n  "dependencies": {\n    "com.syomus.proceduraltoolkit": "https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit.git",\n    "com.unity.package-manager-ui": "2.1.2",\n    "com.unity.modules.ai": "1.0.0",\n    "com.unity.modules.animation": "1.0.0",\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you don\'t want to use Git, you can download this library as an archive and install it as a [local package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html).\n\n### Asset Store or .unitypackage\nThe other way is to import a package from the [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/procedural-toolkit-16508) \nor the [Releases page](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit/releases).\nIf you have any previous versions of the toolkit installed, it is highly recommended to delete them before importing a newer version.\n\n### Getting started\nAfter installation you can import `ProceduralToolkit` namespace and start building your own PCG systems:\n```C#\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing ProceduralToolkit;\n\npublic class ReadmeExample : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    private void Update()\n    {\n        Debug.Log(string.Format("<color=#{0}>{0}</color>", RandomE.colorHSV.ToHtmlStringRGB()));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you are using [Assembly Definitions](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html), \nyou will also need to add `ProceduralToolkit` as a reference.\n\n## I have a problem with Procedural Toolkit\nFirst, please search the [open issues](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit/issues?q=is%3Aopen)\nand [closed issues](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit/issues?q=is%3Aclosed)\nto see if your issue hasn\'t already been reported. If it does exist, add a\n:thumbsup: to the issue to indicate this is also an issue for you, and add a\ncomment to the existing issue if there is extra information you can contribute.\n\nIf you can\'t find a matching issue, open a [new issue](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit/issues/new/choose),\nchoose the right template and provide us with enough information to investigate further. \nAlternatively, you can send a message to the [support email](mailto:proceduraltoolkit@syomus.com).\n\n## Contributing\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for a full guide on how you can help.\n\nIf you\'re looking for something to work on, check out the [help wanted](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"help+wanted") label.\n\nIf you just want to show your appreciation, you can send a donation through [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/ProceduralToolkit/5usd) or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/ProceduralToolkit).\n\n## Toolkit structure\n### Scripts/\n* [ArrayE](/Scripts/ArrayE.cs): Various Array and List extensions, such as looped getters/setters and flood fills.\n* [CellularAutomaton](/Scripts/CellularAutomaton.cs): Generic cellular automaton for two-state rulesets. \nCommon rulesets can be found in CellularAutomaton.Ruleset.\n* [ClipperUtility](/Scripts/ClipperUtility.cs): Utility class for conversion of Clipper data from and to Unity format.\n* [ColorE](/Scripts/ColorE.cs): Color extensions, HTML colors, Gradient constructors.\n* [ColorHSV](/Scripts/ColorHSV.cs): Serializable representation of color in HSV model.\n* [CompoundMeshDraft](/Scripts/CompoundMeshDraft.cs): Helper class for mesh generation supporting large meshes and submeshes.\n* [DebugE](/Scripts/DebugE.cs): Collection of drawing methods similar to Debug.DrawLine.\n* [Directions](/Scripts/Directions.cs): Enum with direction flags along three axes.\n* [Draw](/Scripts/Draw.cs): Collection of generic vector drawing algorithms.\n* [DrawRaster](/Scripts/DrawRaster.cs): Collection of generic raster drawing algorithms.\n* [GizmosE](/Scripts/GizmosE.cs): Collection of drawing methods similar to Gizmos.\n* [GLE](/Scripts/GLE.cs): Collection of GL drawing methods similar to Gizmos.\n* [MeshDraft](/Scripts/MeshDraft.cs): Helper class for mesh generation.\n* [MeshDraftPrimitives](/Scripts/MeshDraftPrimitives.cs): Constructors for MeshDraft primitives.\n* [MeshE](/Scripts/MeshE.cs): Mesh extensions.\n* [PathClipper](/Scripts/PathClipper.cs) and [PathOffsetter](/Scripts/PathOffsetter.cs): [Clipper](http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php) library wrappers.\n* [PTUtils](/Scripts/PTUtils.cs): Various useful methods and constants.\n* [RandomE](/Scripts/RandomE.cs): Class for generating random data.
