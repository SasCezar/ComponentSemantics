b"Pix2Pix for Unity\n=================\n\nThis is an attempt to run [pix2pix] (image-to-image translation with deep\nneural network) in real time with [Unity]. It contains its own implementation\nof an inference engine, so it doesn't require installation of other neural\nnetwork frameworks.\n\n[pix2pix]: https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix\n[Unity]: https://unity3d.com\n\nSketch Pad demo\n---------------\n\n![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/aXYYjes.gif)\n![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Tb0nYqU.gif)\n\n**Sketch Pad** is a demonstration that resembles the famous [edges2cats] demo\nbut in real time. You can download a pre-built binary from the [Releases] page.\n\n[Demo video](https://vimeo.com/287778343)\n\n[edges2cats]: https://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/\n[Releases]: https://github.com/keijiro/Pix2Pix/releases\n\nSystem requirements\n-------------------\n\n- Unity 2018.1\n- Compute shader capability (DX11, Metal, Vulkan, etc.)\n\nAlthough it's implemented in a platform agnostic fashion, many parts of it are\noptimized for NVIDIA GPU architectures. To run the Sketch Pad demo flawlessly,\nit's highly recomended to use a Windows system with GeForce GTX 1070 or greater.\n\nHow to use a trained model\n--------------------------\n\nThis repository doesn't contain any trained model to save the bandwidth and\nstorage quota. To run the example project on Unity Editor, download the\npre-trained [edges2cats model] and copy it into `Assets/StreamingAssets`.\n\n[edges2cats model]: https://github.com/affinelayer/pix2pix-tensorflow-models/blob/master/edges2cats_AtoB.pict\n\nThis implementation only supports the `.pict` weight data format which is used\nin Christopher Hesse's [interactive demo]. You can pick one of the [pre-trained\nmodels] or train your own model with using [pix2pix-tensorflow]. To export\nweight data from a checkpoint, please see the description in the\n[export-checkpoint.py] script.\n\n[interactive demo]: https://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/\n[pre-trained models]: https://github.com/affinelayer/pix2pix-tensorflow-models\n[pix2pix-tensorflow]: https://github.com/affinelayer/pix2pix-tensorflow\n[export-checkpoint.py]: https://github.com/affinelayer/pix2pix-tensorflow/tree/master/server\n"
