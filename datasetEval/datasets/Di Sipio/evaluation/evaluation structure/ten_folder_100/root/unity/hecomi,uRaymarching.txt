The following code is the one generating the example of morphing sphere in *Screenshots* section in this document.\n\n```hlsl\ninline float DistanceFunction(float3 pos)\n{\n    float r = abs(sin(2 * PI * _Time.y / 2.0));\n    float d1 = RoundBox(Repeat(pos, float3(6, 6, 6)), 1 - r, r);\n    float d2 = Sphere(pos, 3.0);\n    float d3 = Plane(pos - float3(0, -3, 0), float3(0, 1, 0));\n    return SmoothMin(SmoothMin(d1, d2, 1.0), d3, 1.0);\n}\n```\n\n*<a href="Assets/uRaymarching/Shaders/Include/Math.cginc">Math.cginc</a>* and *<a href="Assets/uRaymarching/Shaders/Include/Primitives.cginc">Primitives.cginc</a>* are included in the generated shader, so in this example some functions like `RoundBox()` and `Repeat()` come from these include files (of cource you can write them by yourself).\n\nPost Effect\n-----------\n*Post Effect* is similar to a surface function in a surface shader. The following code is used in the hexagon-tile example in *Screenshots* section.\n\n```hlsl\nfloat4 _TopColor;\n\ninline void PostEffect(RaymarchInfo ray, inout PostEffectOutput o)\n{\n    float3 localPos = ToLocal(ray.endPos);\n    o.Emission += smoothstep(0.48, 0.50, localPos.y) * _TopColor;\n    o.Occlusion *= 1.0 - 1.0 * ray.loop / ray.maxLoop;\n}\n```\n\n`RaymarchInfo` is the input and the output of a raymarching calculation and this is defined in *Struct.cginc*.\n\n```hlsl\nstruct RaymarchInfo\n{\n    // Input\n    float3 startPos;    // start position of ray\n    float3 rayDir;      // ray direction\n    float3 projPos;     // ComputeScreenPos-applied position\n    float3 polyNormal;  // normal on polygon surface\n    float minDistance;  // minimum ray distance (comes from material setting)\n    float maxDistance;  // maximum ray distance (changes by the raymarching setting)\n    int maxLoop;        // maximum number of loop (comes from material setting)\n\n    // Output\n    int loop;           // total number of loop of the calculation (<= maxLoop)\n    float3 endPos;      // last position (= surface of the distance function)\n    float lastDistance; // the final distance of the raymarching\n    float totalLength;  // total ray length\n    float depth;        // depth (encoded)\n    float3 normal;      // normal (encoded)\n};\n```\n\nSo `ray.loop / ray.maxLoop` is a normalized value and becomes close to 0.0 on the position where a ray reaches easily and becomes close to 1.0 when hard. So you can use it as a factor of a rechability or `1.0 - ray.loop / ray.maxLoop` as an simple and a light-weight occlusion factor.\n\n`PostEffectOutput` is defferent depending on the selected shader template. For example, it is an alias of `SurfaceOutputStandard` in *Standard* template. Please see each template file by clicking *Edit* button on the right side of the *Shader Template* drop-down list for more details.\n\nExport\n------\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uRaymarching/export.png" width="720" />\n\nPress *Export* button or *Ctrl + R* to export shader. Then, press *Create Material* button to generate a material which uses the shader (or create a material manually from the *Project* pane).\n\nMaterial\n--------\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uRaymarching/material-properties.png" width="720" />\n\n- Loop\n  - The maximum number of loops of raymarching in basic passes.\n- Minimum Distance\n  - If the distance returned by a distance function becomes lower than this value, the loop finishes.\n- Distance Multiplier\n  - This value is multiplied by the output of a distance function.\n- Shadow Loop\n  - The maximum number of loops of raymarching in shadow pass.\n- Shadow Minimum Distance\n  - *Minimum Distance* in shadow pass.\n- Shadow Extra Bias\n  - Additional shadow bias.\n\nFullscreen\n----------\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uRaymarching/world.gif" width="720" />\n\nThe `RaymarchingRenderer` component creates a quad plane and renders raymarching objects on it using `CommandBuffer`.\n\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uRaymarching/raymarching-renderer-component.png" width="720" />\n\nAttach a `RayamarchingRenderer` component to an arbitrary object, and create a material which selects a shader created by uRaymarching with the flag of *Full Screen* (please see the *Conditions* section in this document). Then, set it to the *Material* field, and select the rendering timing from the *Pass* drop-down list. You can see the raymarching world with the distance function you write, and it intersects polygon objects.\n\nHowever, now this has some problems regarding lightings and VR. Please see the following *Known Issues* section regarding those limitations.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n### DepthNormalTexture in forward pass\n\nIn forward pass, `DepthTexture` is rendererd using the `ShadowCaster` pass but `DepthNormalsTexture` uses the built-in replacement shader.\n\n- [Unity - Manual: Camera\'s Depth Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-CameraDepthTexture.html)\n- [Unity - Manual: Rendering with Replaced Shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-ShaderReplacement.html)\n\nThis built-in shader outputs the depth of a polygon surface, so post effects which use `DepthNormalsTexture` like the ambient occlusion in PostProcessing generate wrong results. For now, I don\'t have any good idea to overwrite it with raymarching results.\n\n### No lighting with `RaymarchingRenderer` in forward path\n\nIn forward path, when rendering raymarching objects with `RaymarchingRenderer`, some shader keywords related to the lighting are not defined because it uses `CommandBuffer`. This causes wrong lighting result. So if you want to do fullscreen raymarching in forward path with lighting, please create a large box following the camera (as a child of camera), and set `Cull Off` or `Cull Front` flag, then activate `Camera Inside Object`.\n\n### In VR, both eyes output same image with `RarymarchingRenderer`\n\nIn VR, the cameras for two eyes seem to tell the same position in a shader when using `RaymarchingRenderer`. I\'m not sure how to fix it now, so please do not use it for VR. Instead of using it, please create a shader which enables `Camera Inside Object` and `Disable View Culling` and set `Cull` flag as `Off` in the material inspector. Using `Camera Inside Object` with `Cull Off` allows you to enter raymarching objects. And `Disable View Culling` outputs faked z value in clip space and keeps the raymarching object always visible even if the outside cube polygon is very large. Please see the `Mod World for VR` scene as an example.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 hecomi\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
