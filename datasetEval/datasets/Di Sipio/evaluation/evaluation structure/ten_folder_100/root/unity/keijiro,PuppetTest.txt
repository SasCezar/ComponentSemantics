This is not a complex algorithm, nor\ninvolved any AI-ish techniques. These characters are controlled with a few of\nsin curves and Perlin noise functions. The standard [humanoid IK rig] is used\nto animate the model.\n\n[humanoid IK rig]: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/InverseKinematics.html\n\n![gif](https://i.imgur.com/cqlAwKL.gif)\n![gif](https://i.imgur.com/eu1bEwT.gif)\n\n(Left: Random variations, Right: Synchronized but with random multipliers)\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n'
