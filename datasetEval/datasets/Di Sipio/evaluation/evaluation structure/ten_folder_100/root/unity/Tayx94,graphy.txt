Below you can find a roadmap for future planned features and optimisations that you might be able to help out with. If you want to make a big pull request, please do it on the "dev" branch.\n\nCreate a GitHub issue if you want to start a discussion or request a feature, and please label appropriately.\n\nYou can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2KgNEHK?) for active discussions with other members of the community.\n\n### Roadmap\n\n**Planned features (DEFINITELY YES):**\n\n  - Console Module: (developed in the [console-module](https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy/tree/console-module) branch)\n    - Show Debug.Log messages from Unity in this module.\n    - Log Graphy messages to this module.\n    - Integrate Graphy commands into it.\n    - Allow custom commands from user.\n  - Add GfxDriver stats to the RAM module.\n  - Prewarm framerates: X seconds where min/max fps are not registered to avoid loading spikes registering.\n  - Scale Canvas (GetComponent<Canvas>().scaleFactor *= multiplier;) -> If it changes, set again.\n  - Make a template for a graph + text module so people can create their own easily.\n  - Make UI layout adapt on the fly to compact it when not showing graphs.\n  - Show the UnityStats (batches, draw calls, etc.) data in the Editor.\n    \n**Other features (DEFINITELY MAYBE):** \n\n  - Network Stats Module.\n  - Audio Module:\n  \t- Average of the whole sound.\n\t- Indicator for LUFS.\n  - Allow storing FPS for a predetermined time to allow benchmarks.\n  - Dump all Graphy Data as a string to:\n  \t- File.\n\t- Send to server.\n\t- Send mail.\n  - Add a preprocessor key #GRAPHY to avoid adding the asset in builds.\n  - Click on the graph to change to a minimalised version.\n  - Be able to only show one type of ram in the graph (mostly to be able to see the "mono" ram value spikes with more ease).\n  \n## License\n\nGraphy is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy/blob/master/LICENSE).
