Projects that use Mirror are small, concise and maintainable. uMMORPG was possible with <6000 lines of code. We needed a networking library that allows us to [launch our games](https://mirror-networking.com/showcase/), period.\n\nWith Mirror, the **Server & Client are ONE** project _(hence the name)_. Instead of having one code base for the server and one for the client, we simply use the same code for both of them.\n* `[Server]` / `[Client]` tags can be used for the server-only and client-only parts.\n* `[Command]` are used for Client->Server, and `[ClientRpc]` / `[TargetRpc]` for Server->Client communication.\n* `[SyncVar]`s and `SyncList`s are used to automatically synchronize state.\n\nWhat previously required **10.000** lines of code, now takes **1.000** lines of code. Therein lies the **magic of Mirror**.\n\n_Note: Mirror is based on Unity\'s abandoned UNET Networking system. We fixed it up and pushed it to MMO Scale._\n\n## Documentation\nCheck out our [Documentation](https://mirror-networking.com/docs/).\n\nIf you are migrating from UNET, then please check out our [Migration Guide](https://mirror-networking.com/docs/General/Migration.html). Don\'t panic, it\'s very easy and won\'t take more than 5 minutes.\n\n## Installation\nWe **recommend** to download the most **stable Mirror version** from the [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321)!\n\nFor the latest improvements, [Download Mirror](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror/releases) directly from this repository and extract it in your Assets folder.\n\n## Examples\nWe included several smaller example projects in Mirror.\n\nFor a fully polished, complete project example, consider [uMMORPG](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/ummorpg-51212) or [uSurvival](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/usurvival-95015).\n\n## Transports\nMirror supports many different low level networking transports:\n\n* (built in) https://github.com/vis2k/Telepathy (Telepathy)\n* (built in) Unity\'s LLAPI\n* (built in) https://github.com/ninjasource/Ninja.WebSockets (Websockets)\n* https://github.com/Raystorms/FizzySteamyMirror/ (SteamNetwork)\n* https://github.com/SoftwareGuy/Ignorance/ (ENet)\n* https://github.com/MichalPetryka/LiteNetLib4Mirror (LiteNetLib)\n\n## Donations & Priority Support\nPlease support [Mirror on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/MirrorNetworking). Priority support included!\n\n## Benchmarks\n* Telepathy [1000 connections](https://github.com/vis2k/Telepathy) test\n* [uMMORPG 480 CCU worst case test](https://youtu.be/mDCNff1S9ZU) (everyone broadcasting to everyone else)\n* [uSurvival 122 CCU worst case test](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT28FcGXYlbG8gwi8DhD914n7K-wCAE8qhfetPkSli96ikc1Td3zJO1IiwVhfPVtKUHF0l3N7ZkM5GU/pub#h.pwbvffnwcewe)\n\n## The Mirror Mantra\n> _\xe2\x80\x9cWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\xe2\x80\x9d_<br/>\n> _\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,"_ said the Cat.<br/>\n> _"I don\xe2\x80\x99t much care where\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_ said Alice.<br/>\n> _\xe2\x80\x9cThen it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter which way you go,\xe2\x80\x9d_ said the Cat.<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Alice in Wonderland _(Lewis Carroll)_\n\nAs Indie Developers, **our #1 goal** for Mirror is **Ease of Use**.\n\nIf you want to contribute, always follow the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle. Everything needs to be **as simple as possible**. As result, the code will be stable, easy to understand, easy to modify and easy to maintain 5 years from now when our games are still running.\n\nPull Requests for bug fixes are always highly appreciated. New features will be considered very carefully and will only be merged if they are the most simple solution to the given problem.\n'
