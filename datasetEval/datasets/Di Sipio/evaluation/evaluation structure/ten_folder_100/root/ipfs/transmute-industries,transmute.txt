If you are just using the cli to spin up and manage k8s clusters or one of the other packages in this mono repo, you can skip these steps.\n\nIn order to connect to services running in your cluster, you will need to update your transmute-config. The mono repo contains a web dashboard which can be used to test your services. Make sure to update `transmute-config/env.json` before attempting to use lerna to build the project. \n\nFinal steps - linking everything and migrating your smart contracts\n\n1. Navigate to the root directory\n1. Run `npm i && lerna bootstrap`\n1. Run `lerna run --scope transmute-framework truffle:test`\n1. Run `lerna run --scope transmute-framework truffle:migrate`\n1. Run `lerna run --scope transmute-framework test`\n1. Navigate to the `/packages/transmute-dashboard/` directory\n1. Run `npm run truffle:migrate`\n1. Run `npm run start`\n\nThat\'s it!
