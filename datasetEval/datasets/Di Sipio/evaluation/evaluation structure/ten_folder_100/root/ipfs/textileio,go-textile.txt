We like to think of it as a decentralized data wallet with built-in protocols for sharing and recovery, or more simply, **an open and programmable iCloud**.\n\n**Please see [Textile Docs](https://docs.textile.io/) for more**.\n\nJoin us on our [public Slack channel](https://slack.textile.io/) for news, discussions, and status updates. [Check out our blog](https://medium.com/textileio) for the latest posts and announcements.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n-   [Security](#security)\n-   [Background](#background)\n-   [Install](#install)\n-   [Usage](#usage)\n-   [Contributing](#contributing)\n-   [Changelog](#changelog)\n-   [License](#license)\n\n## Security\n\nTextile is still under heavy development and no part of it should be used before a thorough review of the underlying code and an understanding that APIs and protocols may change rapidly. There may be coding mistakes and the underlying protocols may contain design flaws. Please [let us know](mailto:contact@textile.io) immediately if you have discovered a security vulnerability.\n\nPlease also read the [security note](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs#security-issues) for [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs).\n\n## Background\n\nTextile is a set of tools and trust-less infrastructure for building _censorship resistant_ and _privacy preserving_ applications.\n\nWhile interoperable with the whole [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) peer-to-peer network, Textile-flavored peers represent an additional layer or sub-network of **users, applications, and services**.\n\nWith good encryption defaults and anonymous, disposable application services like [cafes](https://docs.textile.io/concepts/cafes/), Textile aims to bring the decentralized internet to real products that people love.\n\n[Continue reading](https://docs.textile.io/concepts/) about Textile...\n\n## Install\n\n    env GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/textileio/go-textile\n    env GO111MODULE=on go install github.com/textileio/go-textile/cmd/textile\n\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.textile.io/install/the-daemon/) for pre-built binaries are in [the docs](https://docs.textile.io).\n\n## Usage\n\nGo to https://godoc.org/github.com/textileio/go-textile.\n\nThe [Tour of Textile](https://docs.textile.io/a-tour-of-textile/) goes through many examples and use cases. `textile --help` provides a quick look at the available APIs. For a full overview of every CLI command available, refer to our [Command Line Documentation](https://docs.textile.io/develop/clients/command-line/).\n\n### Requirements\n\n-   go >= 1.12\n\nExtra setup steps are needed to build the bindings for iOS or Android, as `gomobile` does not yet support [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). You'll need to **move the go-textile source** into your `GOPATH` (like pre-go1.11 development), before installing and initializing the `gomobile` tools:\n\n    go get golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile\n    gomobile init\n\nNow you can execute the iOS and Android build tasks below. For the other build tasks, the source must _not_ be under `GOPATH`. Go 1.13 is supposed to bring module support to `gomobile`, at which point we can remove this madness!\n\n### Install dependencies:\n\n    make setup\n\n### Build `textile`:\n\n    make textile\n\n### Run unit tests:\n\n    make test\n\n### Build the iOS framework:\n\n    make ios\n\n### Build the Android Archive Library (aar):\n\n    make android\n\n### Build the swagger docs:\n\n    make docs\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project is a work in progress. As such, there's a few things you can do right now to help out:\n\n-   **Ask questions**! We'll try to help. Be sure to drop a note (on the above issue) if there is anything you'd like to work on and we'll update the issue to let others know. Also [get in touch](https://slack.textile.io) on Slack.\n-   **Open issues**, [file issues](https://github.com/textileio/go-textile/issues), submit pull requests!\n-   **Perform code reviews**. More eyes will help a) speed the project along b) ensure quality and c) reduce possible future bugs.\n-   **Take a look at the code**. Contributions here that would be most helpful are **top-level comments** about how it should look based on your understanding. Again, the more eyes the better.\n-   **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests.\n\nBefore you get started, be sure to read our [contributors guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [contributor covenant code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Changelog\n\n[Changelog is published to Releases.](https://github.com/textileio/go-textile/releases)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n"
