b'# InterPlanetary File System for Business (IPFSfB)\n\n[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/IBM/IPFSfB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/IPFSfB)\n\nThis repository contains instructions to build a private, unstructured data storage network for any blockchain on distributed file system, InterPlanetary File System for Business (IPFSfB), using crypto tools and Docker images with Docker and Docker Compose to provision the enterprise blockchain storage network.\n\n## Overview\n\nInterPlanetary File System for Business (IPFSfB) is based on InterPlanetary File System, which aim to provide an enterprise form, unstructured data storage network for any blockchain.\n\n## Flow\n\nCurrently we have two flows for each contributors and users.\n\n### Flow 1: for contributors\n\n![IPFSfB Contributor Flow](docs/flow/flow-v1-contributor.png)\n\nThe contributor flow tells you how to contribute to IPFSfB. You can also refer to the [contributors guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Flow 2: for users\n\n![IPFSfB User Flow](docs/flow/flow-v3-user.png)\n\nThe user flow corresponds how to set up a private network, which you can refer to [running a private network](#1-running-a-private-network).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)\n- [Go](https://golang.org/)\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)\n\n## Building from source\n\nBuilding from source with IPFSfB repository:\n\n``` bash\ngo get -u github.com/IBM/IPFSfB\n```\n\nBuilding from source with IPFSfB tools, once the repository is downloaded, run:\n\n``` bash\nmake swarmkeygen\n```\n\nor build all utilities:\n\n``` bash\nmake all\n```\n\n## Steps\n\n1. [Running a private network](#1-running-a-private-network)\n2. [Runtime instructions](#2-runtime-instructions)\n3. [Scenarios](#3-scenarios)\n4. [Considerations](#4-considerations)\n5. [Architecture](#5-architecture)\n6. [Troubleshooting](#6-troubleshooting)\n7. [Related links](#7-related-links)\n8. [License](#8-license)\n\n## 1. Running a private network\n\nCurrently, we are offering simple network as one of the samples. It contains three senarios including peer-to-peer, peer-to-server, and peer to peer and to server. You can follow the [tutorial](docs/tutorial/simple-network.md) to envision and run a private network.\n\n## 2. Runtime instructions\n\nIf you are running a private network, [config.sh](samples/simple-network/config.sh) file will help containers to check runtime health. Regularly inspect docker containers log in the runtime environment may be helpful.\n\n## 3. Scenarios\n\nOne of the samples, simple network is avaliable in three scenarios ([p2p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer), [p2s](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2S), and [p2sp](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2SP)).\n\nThe scenario guidelines are available at [docs/tutorial/simple-network.md](docs/tutorial/simple-network.md).\n\n### Accessing and running\n\nYou can access and download network specific binaries and images through [bootstrap.sh](samples/simple-network/scripts/bootstrap.sh). Once downloaded, you can run these network scenarios by [pnet.sh](samples/simple-network/pnet.sh).\n\n### End-to-end testing\n\nEach scenarios have end-to-end testing, located in [samples/simple-network/e2e](samples/simple-network/e2e).\n\n## 4. Considerations\n\nThere are several considerations for the roadmap of IPFSfB.\n\n### Performance and production\n\nFor the private or enterprise network performance, such as uploading a file, downloading a file, hosting a web, and even collaborating a documentation from the network, we need more network connection cases and speed performance to test the network.\n\nIPFSfB production will not only include simple network scenarios for private network, but also give a vision for clustering, consensus enabled enterprise network.\n\n### Extension\n\n- General data interface for any blockchain\n- VS Code extension\n- Hyperledger Fabric extension\n\n## 5. Architecture\n\nWe have made a document references for the architecture diagrams.\nYou can refer to the [architecture](docs/arch/architecture-references.md) document for the architecture of each scenarios.\n\n## 6. Troubleshooting\n\nIf you have encountered a problem for running IPFSfB, raise an issue and mention one of the maintainers in the [maintainers board](MAINTAINERS.md#maintainers-board).\n\n## 7.
