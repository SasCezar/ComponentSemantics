Swarm is supported for deployment.\n\nWith Embark you can:\n\n**Blockchain (Ethereum)**\n* Automatically deploy contracts and make them available in your JS code. Embark watches for changes, and if you update a contract, Embark will automatically redeploy the contracts (if needed) and the dapp.\n* Contracts are available in JS with Promises.\n* Do Test Driven Development with Contracts using Javascript.\n* Keep track of deployed contracts; deploy only when truly needed.\n* Manage different chains (e.g testnet, private net, livenet)\n* Easily manage complex systems of interdependent contracts.\n\n**Decentralized Storage (IPFS, Swarm)**\n* Easily Store & Retrieve Data on the DApp through EmbarkJS. Including uploading and retrieving files.\n* Deploy the full application to IPFS or Swarm.\n* Import and deploy contracts hosted on Swarm.\n\n\n**Decentralized Communication (Whisper, Orbit)**\n* Easily send/receive messages through channels in P2P through Whisper or Orbit.\n\n**Web Technologies**\n* Integrate with any web technology including React, Foundation, etc..\n* Use any build pipeline or tool you wish, including grunt, gulp and webpack.\n\n```Bash\n$ npm -g install embark\n```\n\nSee [Complete Documentation](https://embark.status.im/docs/).\n'
