With ipfs.ink, you can just write your essay, review the preview and then publish with a single click. Your essay is added to ipfs and you receive a unique link that you can send to other people.\n\nThey are then able to read a nicely rendered version of your markdown essay.\n\nFor example, the short text above can be viewed here:\n\n```\nhttps://ipfs.ink/e/QmULtKYfv5CSGeesjDiBQbfoB3S1F7QY33Dpu59HzRSATu\n```\n\nIf you found this project, you might already know about ipfs. If you don't know why you would want to publish to ipfs, read it on [ipfs.io](https://ipfs.io/).\n\n## Development\n\nRun `./index.js` in one terminal, run `WEBPACK_DEV=1 cargo run` in another.\n\n## Status\n\nThis project is in an early phase.
