Also, the DApp could runnning on iOS, Android or HTML5 client and ignore the difference of platforms.\n\n`Hero` focus on building a unified blockchain developing eco-system and create a brand new, distributed blockchain form that will completely changed the existing DApp development flow and become the future of cornerstone of blockchain development.\n\nFor more infomation, please visit out website [heronode.io](https://heronode.io)\n'
