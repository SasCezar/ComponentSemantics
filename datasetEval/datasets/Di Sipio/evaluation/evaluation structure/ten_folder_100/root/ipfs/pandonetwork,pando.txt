It is built on top of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), [ethereum](https://ethereum.org) and [aragonOS](https://aragon.one/os).\n\nThis repository is a monorepo including all pando-related smart contracts, apps and CLI tools. Each public sub-package is independently published to NPM.\n\n## Published Packages\n\n| Package                                                 | Description                                |\n| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| [`@pando/git-pando`](/packages/git-pando)               | Git extension for pando                    |\n| [`@pando/git-remote-pando`](/packages/git-remote-pando) | git-remote-helper for pando                |\n| [`@pando/colony`](/packages/pando-colony)               | Aragon app implementing pando colonies     |\n| [`@pando/kit`](/packages/pando-kit)                     | Aragon DAOKit for pando organizations      |\n| [`@pando/repository`](/packages/pando-repository)       | Aragon app implementing pando repositories |\n\n## Background\n\nThis software is still in beta stage and is not meant to be used in production yet. The testnet version is expected for Q2 2019. The mainnet version is expected for Q3 2019.\n\n### Why pando ?\n\nPando [Latin for "spread out"] is a clonal colony of a single male quaking aspen determined to be a single living organism by identical genetic markers and assumed to have one massive underground root system. The plant occupies 43 hectares and is estimated to weigh collectively 6.000.000 kilograms, making it the heaviest known organism. The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80.000 years old, is among the oldest known living organisms.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Clone\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/pandonetwork/pando.git && cd pando\n```\n\n### Install\n\n```\nnpm run install:all\n```\n\n### Compile contracts\n\n```\nnpm run compile:all\n```\n\n### Build CLIs\n\n```\nnpm run build:all\n```\n\n### Link binaries\n\n```\nnpm run link:all\n```\n\n### Spawn IPFS & devchain\n\nIn two different terminal windows, run:\n\n```\naragon devchain\naragon ipfs\n```\n\n### Publish aragonPM packages\n\n```\nlerna run publish:devnet\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nSee the `git-pando` [README](packages/git-pando).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFeel free to fork, open issues and send pull requests.\n\n## License\n\nMIT \xc2\xa9 2019 Pando Network\n'
