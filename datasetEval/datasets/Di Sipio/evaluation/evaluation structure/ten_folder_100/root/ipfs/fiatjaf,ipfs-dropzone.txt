b'Instead of uploading the dropped files to an URL, this subclass of [Dropzone.js](http://www.dropzonejs.com/) publishes them to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) with [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) (no running local nodes needed).\n\nBoth [ipfs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs) and [dropzone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dropzone) are peer dependencies.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst IPFSDropzone = require(\'ipfs-dropzone\')\n\nlet dz = IPFSDropzone(\'#files\', {\n  /*\n    the name of the repo which will store the IPFS blocks in the browser.\n    this name will be used by IPFS to create the IndexedDB databases.\n\n    defaults to "ipfs-dropzone"\n  */\n  ipfsRepoName: \'filemap.xyz\',\n\n  /*\n    ipfsPath is a function that takes the dropzone file object\n    and returns a string that will be used as the path when calling\n    https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#add\n\n    defaults to (file) => file.name\n  */\n  ipfsPath: file => file.name\n\n  // all other options you\'ll normally pass to dropzone go here.\n})\n\ndz.on(\'success\', file => {\n  /*\n    everywhere the normal dropzone file object will now have a\n    property called "ipfs" which contains the result to the call to\n    https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#add\n  */\n\n  console.log(\'file published to ipfs: \' + file.ipfs[0].hash)\n\n  /*\n    your dropzone object will also have the property "node", which\n    resolves to the IPFS node the dropzone object is using.\n    it is a Promise because the IPFS node is only initialized at the\n    moment of the first file upload.\n  */\n  dz.node.then(ipfs => {\n    ipfs.files.cat(file.hash, (err, file) => {\n      console.log(file.toString(\'utf-8\'))\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Information\n\n  * Most normal Dropzone features and events should work, but I\'m not sure.\n  * There\'s no way to cancel the process of adding a file.\n  * I don\'t know how to publish this package in a way all JS transpilers and bundlers out there can understand. Please help me.\n  * Please read the source if something is unclear. The source is really small.\n\n## What is the LICENSE?\n\nThe MIT License.\n'
