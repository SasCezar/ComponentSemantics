b'# Dynamic Data and Capabilities in IPFS Special Interest Group\n\n[![#ipfs-dynamic-data](https://img.shields.io/badge/irc-%23ipfs--dynamic--data-brightgreen.svg)](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs-dynamic-data)\n\n> Research and development of building blocks that enable collaborative applications, providing solutions for security, identity, access control, concurrency, synchronization, offline and near-real-time collaboration on top of IPFS.\n\n## Responsibilities include\n\n- Research and implement CRDTs on top of IPFS, creating building blocks that can be used by other applications.\n- Research Cryptographic ACLs (Capabilities Systems) and create building blocks that implement.\n- Apply this research and implementation to products like PeerPad, validating the solutions and defining new problems to be solved.\n\n## Weekly Sync\n\nJoin us on our calls. For that, check out [the global IPFS community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ipfs.io_eal36ugu5e75s207gfjcu0ae84@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC).

Besides making live changes to a given document, it allows read-only nodes to follow the changes in real-time. It also allows you to publish a self-contained snapshot of the document to IPFS.\n- [delta-crdts](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/js-delta-crdts#delta-crdts): delta-state-based CRDTs in JavaScript.\n- 2 research RFPs:\n  - [Optimize storage and convergence time in causal CmRDTs](https://github.com/protocol/research/issues/9)\n  - [Decentralised Access Control in CRDTs](https://github.com/protocol/research/issues/8)\n- [Identity RFC](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star/blob/c249510b4873a9a4b58b245bf97dbe48513a2689/docs/rfc-identity.md): an identity\n- [Identity Manager](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-idm): Identity Manager reference implementation\n- [Discussify](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/discussify/): Fully decentralized platform for discussing anything on the web.\n\n## Chronology\n\n- **Apr 2019:** DDC became a [Special Interest Group](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/blob/master/TEAMS_ROLES_STRUCTURES.md#team-structures)\n- **Jul 2018:** [PeerPad](https://peerpad.net/) now uses [peer-star-app](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star-app).\n- **Jun 2018:**\xc2\xa0created [peer-star-app](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star-app).\n  - Peer-Star App support for real-time collaborative DApps built on top of IPFS.\n- **Jun 2018:**\xc2\xa0published [Identity RFC](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star/blob/c249510b4873a9a4b58b245bf97dbe48513a2689/docs/rfc-identity.md).\n  - Identity management system for DApps.\n- **May 2018:** Published\xc2\xa0[delta-crdts](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/js-delta-crdts).\n  - Delta state-based CRDTs in Javascript NPM package.\n- **Apr 2018:** Launched 2 CRDT research RFPs.\n  - [Optimize storage and convergence time in causal CmRDTs](https://github.com/protocol/research/issues/9).\n  - [Decentralised Access Control in CRDTs](https://github.com/protocol/research/issues/8).\n- **Apr 2018, \xf0\x9f\x93\x8d Lisbon:** Held CRDT research day mini-conf.\n- **Apr 2018:** started Working Group bi-weekly call.\n- **Mar 2018:** created [peer-star](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star).\n  - Distributed Applications and their internal building blocks exposed as reusable components that can be used for all kinds of p2p use-cases.\n- **Mar 2018:**\xc2\xa0[Dynamic Data and Capabilities Working Group](https://github.com/ipfs/dynamic-data-and-capabilities) was born.\n  - Research and development of building blocks that enable collaborative applications, providing solutions for security, identity, access control, concurrency, synchronization, offline and near-real-time collaboration on top of IPFS.\n- **Oct 2017:** [PeerPad](https://peerpad.net/) MozFest 2017 demo.\n  - Fully decentralised private collaborative text editor.\n- **Jun 2017, \xf0\x9f\x93\x8d Rome:** 2017 IIIF conference demo.\n  - Two different products implementing IIIF were demoed using [ipfs-iiif-db](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-iiif-db) to sync annotation data between them.\n- **Jun 2017:** created\xc2\xa0[ipfs-iiif-db](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-iiif-db).\n  - Allowing syncing\xc2\xa0[IIIF](http://iiif.io/)\xc2\xa0annotation data in a truly server-less and conflict-free way.\n- **May 2017:** first version of\xc2\xa0[y-ipfs-connector](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/y-ipfs-connector#readme).\n  - A connector that allows Y.js, the CRDT library, to use the IPFS network.\n- **Mar 2017:** created [Research CRDT](https://github.com/ipfs/research-CRDT).\n  - Gathering research papers and discussions.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThere are several ways you can get involved:\n\n* Join our [#ipfs-dynamic-data IRC Channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs-dynamic-data)\n* Join us on our regular calls.
