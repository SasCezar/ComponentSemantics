b'# Luckychain\n\nLuckychain is a blockchain [layered on top](http://mitar.tnode.com/post/146227562556/towards-layered-re-decentralized-web)\nof [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/). It uses [Intel SGX](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx)\ncapabilities of modern CPUs for Proof of Luck consensus algorithm which allows energy efficient mining.\nTransactions can reference arbitrary data of practically unlimited size. A new block is mined on\naverage every 13 seconds. It is written in JavaScript and uses a [NPM package which allows running JavaScript in SGX enclaves](https://github.com/luckychain/node-secureworker).\n\n**Warning: This is a prototype. Do not use it yet for anything important.**\n\nCurrent implementation uses mock SGX implementation without any of the security assurances of the SGX platform.\nHelp finalizing the [NPM package with full SGX support is welcome](https://github.com/luckychain/node-secureworker).\n\n## Build guide\n\nThis library has the following system dependencies:\n\n* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (tested with v6.10.0): \n  * You can install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/),\n  * or use your system\'s package,\n  * or [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).\n* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)\n  * Download the [prebuilt package](https://ipfs.io/docs/install/),\n  * then untar the package `tar xvfz go-ipfs.tar.gz`\n  * and run `ln -s "$(pwd)/go-ipfs/ipfs" /usr/local/bin/ipfs`.\n\nAfter installing the aforementioned system dependencies, install the node dependencies in the root of this repository:\n\n```\n$ npm install\n```\n\n## Start\n\nInitialize IPFS the first time:\n\n```\n$ ipfs init\n```\n\nStart the IPFS daemon:\n\n```\n$ ipfs daemon --enable-pubsub-experiment\n```\n\nLastly, start the application:\n```\n$ npm start\n```\n\nOpen the web interface at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).\n\n## Docker\n\nYou can use [Docker to run Luckychain](https://hub.docker.com/r/luckychain/luckychain/):\n\n```\ndocker run -d -p 4001:4001/tcp -p 4002:4002/udp -p 8000:8000/tcp --name luckychain luckychain/luckychain\n```\n\n## Whitepaper\n\nThe whitepaper describing Proof of luck consensus protocol and Luckychain blockchain was published in\nSysTEX \'16 Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on System Software for Trusted Execution,\n[DOI 10.1145/3007788.3007790](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3007788.3007790).\n\nAvailable at:\n\n* https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3007790\n* https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05435\n* https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/249\n\nAbstract:\n\n> In the paper, we present designs for multiple blockchain consensus primitives and a novel blockchain\n> system, all based on the use of trusted execution environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX-enabled CPUs.\n> First, we show how using TEEs for existing proof of work schemes can make mining equitably distributed\n> by preventing the use of ASICs. Next, we extend the design with proof of time and proof of ownership\n> consensus primitives to make mining energy- and time-efficient. Further improving on these designs,\n> we present a blockchain using a proof of luck consensus protocol. Our proof of luck blockchain uses\n> a TEE platform\'s random number generation to choose a consensus leader, which offers low-latency\n> transaction validation, deterministic confirmation time, negligible energy consumption, and equitably\n> distributed mining. Lastly, we discuss a potential protection against up to a constant number of\n> compromised TEEs.\n\nYou can cite it as:\n\n```\n@inproceedings{Milutinovic2016,\n author = {Milutinovic, Mitar and He, Warren and Wu, Howard and Kanwal, Maxinder},\n title = {Proof of Luck: An Efficient Blockchain Consensus Protocol},\n booktitle = {Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on System Software for Trusted Execution},\n series = {SysTEX \'16},\n year = {2016},\n isbn = {978-1-4503-4670-2},\n location = {Trento, Italy},\n pages = {2:1--2:6},\n articleno = {2},\n numpages = {6},\n url = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3007788.3007790},\n doi = {10.1145/3007788.3007790},\n acmid = {3007790},\n publisher = {ACM},\n address = {New York, NY, USA},\n keywords = {Blockchain, Consensus Protocol, Intel SGX, Trusted Execution Environments},\n} \n```\n'
