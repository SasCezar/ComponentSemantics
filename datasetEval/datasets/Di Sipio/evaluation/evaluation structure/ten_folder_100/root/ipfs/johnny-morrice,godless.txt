b'# Godless\n\nA toy peer-to-peer database for the future internet.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nGodless is a way of sharing structured data between computers without using servers or the cloud.\n\nCheck [the wiki](https://github.com/johnny-morrice/godless/wiki) for a tutorial.\n\n## Try it!\n\nRun IPFS:\n\n```\n$ ipfs daemon\n```\n\nRun server:\n\n```\n$ godless init\n$ godless store server --early\n```\n\nThe `--early` flag indicates that the server should fail if it can find no running IPFS daemon.\n\nNow send queries to the server using `godless query console`:\n\n```\n> join books rows (@key=book50, authorName="EL James", publisher="Don\'t wanna know")\n\nQmPbufdDocGLc1jxmyLwMXdNpnj4Gsgs5Ve5ky4at5DFYx\nWaited 278.572562ms for response from server.\n\n> select books where str_eq(@key, "book50")\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n| Table | Row    | Entry      | Point            |\n--------------------------------------------------\n| books | book50 | authorName | EL James         |\n| books | book50 | publisher  | Don\'t wanna know |\n--------------------------------------------------\nFound 2 Namespace Entries.\nWaited 29.798089ms for response from server.\n```\n\n\n## How does it work?\n\nData is stored in a [CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) namespace suitable for sharing between peers.  This is indexed using an another datastructure which itself is a CRDT.  Indexes and namespaces are arranged into a canonical order and saved to the [Interplanetary File System](http://ipfs.io/).  \n\nThe datastructures can be reassembled at another peer by looking up the IPFS hash.  Index hashes are shared over PubSub.\n\nCrucially, data is signed using strong cryptography.  You can specify a key in your queries to sign (in joins) or verify (in selects).  This is crucial to maintaining data consistency in the face of arbitrary joins by other net users :).\n\n## Installing\n\nGodless is currently in alpha stage for Linux only.\n\n### For everyone\n\nCheck out the [releases page](https://github.com/johnny-morrice/godless/releases).\n\nDownload signatures from [teoma.org.uk](https://teoma.org.uk/godless.html).\n\n### For Golang programmers\n\n```\ngo get -u github.com/johnny-morrice/godless/godless\n```\n'
