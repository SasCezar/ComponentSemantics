New search systems will drive its growth. Google is the most powerful religion ever, and now is the time to abandon it.\n\n<div align="center">\n <img src="./docs/img/cyber.png"/>\n</div>\n\n## What is Cyber\n\nCyber is a knowledge consensus computer or a search engine, which computes the [cyber~Rank]() like token, that is a weighted [Page Rank]() of a knowledge graph of the [Content IDentificators (CIDs)](), that are linked to each other with the help of [cyberlinks](): \n\n```\nCID1 -----> CID2\n```\n\nCyberlinks are committed by Web3 agents. They are links between two CIDs. In its current implementation, a CID is an IPFS hash of the CIDv0 or of the CIDv1 versions. A web3 agent can link CID of any keyword, app, whatever with a other CID and and then, create a link between the two hashes, with a weight corresponding to the stake.\n\nAll the cyberlinks with a given weight are stored within the knowledge graph. The graph is re-computed by the validators every given number of blocks. For the calculations, we\'ve implemented "the proof of relevance" root-hash, which is computes from CIDs rank values (which computes on CUDA GPUs every round). \n\nCyberd is the first implementation of the cyber protocol. It is based on the [cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and [tendermint BFT Consensus](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint). \n\nThis implementation uses a very simple bandwidth model. The main goal of the model is to reduce the daily networks growth to a given constant.\n\nThus, here we introduce [resource credits(RS)](). Each message, of a transaction type - for example, a "link" or a "send" have been assigned an RS cost. We call this "Bandwidth". A users bandwidth depends on its balance and is equal to the sum of their liquid and staked tokens. The users\' bandwidth is a recoverable value. Full recovery of the bandwidths quantity, from 0 to maximum value - takes `RecoveryWindow` blocks.\n\nThere is a period `AdjustPricePeriod`, summing how much RS or bandwidth was spent during that period (`RecoveryPeriod`). The `SpentBandwidth/DesirableBandwidth` ratio defines the so-called current `price multiplier`. If the network usage is low, the `price multiplier` adjusts the message cost (simply by multiplying) to allow a user with a lower stake to make more transactions. If the demand for resources increases, the `price multiplier` goes `>1` thus, increasing message cost and limiting final tx count for a long-term period (RC recovery will be `<` then RC spending).\n\n\n## For validators\n\nEach validator participates in the tendermint consensus and computes/validates cyber\xe2\x80\xa2Rank within the knowledge graph.\n\n\n## For rank providers\n\nRank providers crawls/indexes the web, and then cyberlinks CIDs of any given data to cyberd by consuming its bandwidth.\n\n\n## For search users\n\nA valuable, censorship-resistant and a provable search of the web for any kind of species. A search is transactionally-based, and only possible if the agent has enough bandwidth.\n\n\n## For developers\n\nThe chance to create a new and a decentralized Google with affiliated services like: SEO, crawlers, web indexers, decentralized platforms and so on. You can be the first to do so. \n\n## For data/content producers\n\nThe opportunity to move their content to web3 and save it from any type of censorship. Your content is yours. Make sure others will be able to see it.\n\n## For miners / GPUs holders\n\nWith the growth of the network, we will need cards, a lot of cards. Join us.\n\n\n## cyber\xe2\x80\xa2Rank\n```\n0. cyber\xe2\x80\xa2Rank - a token weighted Page Rank (initial implementation).\n1. A knowledge graph consists of CIDs, which are connected with cyberlinks. \n2. A cyberlink may be cast once only; between any given CIDs. \n3. The weight of cyberlink is the token balance of the agent, which cyber linked given CIDs. \n4. A rank computes within the current ranks calculation of the networks window on CUDA kernel.\n5. After cyber\xe2\x80\xa2Ranks computation, each CID take a given rank.\n6. [Very important] A rank computation is based on the current (computation window) agents balances.\n```\n\n## Bandwidth\n```\n0. The network has a desirable network bandwidth (max bandwidth).\n1. An agent\'s bandwidth is proportional to the stake that he owns against the total network supply.\n2. Linking and other chain operations consume bandwidth.\n3. It takes RecoveryPeriod blocks for a full recovery of an agent\'s bandwidth.\n4. The network gives a discount of up to 100X of the operational costs for incentivized loads.\n```\n\n## Search index and proofs\n```\n0. A node can be launched in an "ALLOW SEARCH" mode, which allows searching with this node, within the knowledge graph.\n1. A node that is in search mode, also constructs a full Merkle tree for cyberlinks and calculates link ranks.\n2. Proof of rank of a given CID provides a Merkle path, which allows the client to validate the returned rank of a given CID and the existence of a given cyberlink.\n3. The Merkle root of rank and the Merke roots of the link Merkle trees are used for calculating the app hash for each block, and are part of the protocol/consensus.\n```\n\n## Technologies\n```\n1.
