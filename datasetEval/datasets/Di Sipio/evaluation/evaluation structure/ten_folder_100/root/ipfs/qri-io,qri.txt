Its underlying technology \xe2\x80\x93 git \xe2\x80\x93 popularized some magic sauce that has inspired a generation of programmers and popularized concepts at the heart of the distributed web. Qri is applying that family of concepts to four common data problems:\n\n1. **Discovery** _Can I find data I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for?_\n2. **Trust** _Can I trust what I\xe2\x80\x99ve found?_\n3. **Friction** _Can I make this work with my other stuff?_\n4. **Sync** _How do I handle changes in data?_\n\nBecause qri is *global* and *content-addressed*, adding data to qri also checks the entire network to see if someone has added it before. Since qri is focused solely on datasets, it can provide meaningful search results. Every change on qri is associated with a peer, creating an audit-able trail you can use to quickly see what has changed and who has changed it. All datasets on qri are automatically described at the time of ingest using a flexible schema that makes data naturally inter-operate. Qri comes with tools to turn *all* datasets on the network into a JSON API with a single command. Finally, all changes in qri are tracked & synced.\n\n## Packages\n\nQri is comprised of many specialized packages.

Package | Version |\n|--------|-------|\n| `ipfs` | [![ipfs version](https://img.shields.io/badge/ipfs-v0.4.17-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/) |\n\n<a id="build"></a>\n## Building From Source\n\nTo build qri you\'ll need the [go programming language](https://golang.org/dl/) on your machine. We require at least `go` version 1.12 to build qri.\n\nBuilding then depends upon your operating system:\n\n### Mac OSX\n\nHaving `go` installed is enough, proceed to <a href="#building">building</a>.\n\n### Windows\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have distributable single exe releases of `qri` yet, but those are planned. For now, you will need to build `qri` from source.\n\nTo start, make sure that you have enabled [Developer Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development). A library that we depend on needs it enabled in order to properly handle symlinks. If not done, you\'ll likely get the error message "A required privilege is not held by the client".\n\nYou should not need to Run As Administrator to build or run `qri`. We do not recommend using administrator to run `qri`.\n\n#### Shell\n\nFor your shell, we recommend using [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/). Other shells, such as `cmd`, `Powershell`, or `cygwin` may also be usable, but `msys2` makes it easy to install our required dependencies. IPFS also recommends `msys2`, and `qri` is built on top of IPFS.\n\n#### Dependencies\n\nBuilding depends upon having `git` and `make` installed. If using `msys2`, you can easily install these by using the package manager "pacman". In a shell, type:\n\n```shell\npacman -S git make\n```\n\nAssuming you\'ve also installed `go` using the official Windows installer linked above, you will also need to add `go` to your `PATH` by modifying your environment variable.\n\n#### Environment variables\n\nTo set Environment variables, open Windows Settings, and search for "Environment variables". This will open System Properties -> Advanced; on this dialog click "Environment Variables...". Here you can edit `PATH` by adding a new entry. The value of `PATH` is multiple locations on your file system, separated by a semi-colon (;) character. Using the list based editor will insert these semi-colons for you.\n\nDue to how msys2 treats the `PATH` variable, you also need to add a new environment variable `MSYS2_PATH_TYPE`, with the value `inherit`, using the same procedure.\n\nAlternatively, you can assign environment variables by modifying `.bash_profile` in `msys2`. Lookup bash documentation for more information on this approach.\n\nYou will also need to set your `GOPATH` using these same methods. Read the next section for more information.\n\n#### Go workspaces\n\nIf you are new to developing `go`, you should know that `go` prefers to work a bit differently than most languages. Please read this guide [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html), so that you understand how to create a workspace. Once you have your workspace decided upon, set your `GOPATH` and `PATH` variables setup as described in that guide.\n\nLet\'s say, for example, that your workspace lives at "c:\\Users\\me\\go", and `go` was installed at "c:\\Go". Then you should have your `GOPATH` be equal to "c:\\Users\\me\\go" and your `PATH` something like "...;c:\\Go;$GOPATH\\bin".\n\nOnce these steps are complete, proceed to <a href="#building">building</a>.\n\n### Linux\n\nOn a Raspberry PI, you\'ll need to increase your swap file size in order to build. Normal desktop and server linux OSes should be fine to proceed to <a href="#building">building</a>.\n\nOne symptom of having not enough swap space is the `go install` command producing an error message ending with:\n\n```\nlink: signal: killed\n```\n\nTo increase your swapfile size, first turn off the swapfile:\n\n```\nsudo dphys-swapfile swapoff\n```\n\nThen edit `/etc/dphys-swapfile` as root and set `CONF_SWAPSIZE` to 1024.\n\nFinally turn on the swapfile again:\n\n```\nsudo dphys-swapfile swapon\n```\n\nOtherwise linux machines with reduced memory will have other ways to increase their swap file sizes. Check documentation for your particular machine.\n\n### Building\n\nIn your shell, navigate to your `go` workspace, and get the source code for this repository.\n\n```shell\n$ cd $GOPATH\n$ mkdir -p src/github.com/qri-io\n$ cd src/github.com/qri-io\n$ git clone https://github.com/qri-io/qri\n```\n\nNow enter this main source repo, make sure [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) are enabled, and finally build:\n\n```shell\n$ cd qri\n$ export GO111MODULE=on\n$ make build\n```\n\nThe `make build` command will have a lot of output. That\'s good! Its means it\'s working :)\n\nIt\'ll take a minute, but once everything\'s finished a new binary `qri` will appear in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory. You should be able to run:\n\n```shell\n$ qri help\n```\nand see help output.\n\n\n###### This documentation has been adapted from the [Cycle.js](https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs) documentation.\n'
