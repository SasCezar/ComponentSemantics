b'# About\n## What is this?\n\nIf you don\'t know what Torrent Paradise is, see the [website](https://torrent-paradise.ml/about.html).\n\nThis is a repository of all the tools I use to build and run torrent-paradise.ml. The \'code name\' of the project is nextgen (next gen torrent search), so don\'t be surprised if it comes up somewhere.\n\n## Can you help me?\nMaybe, open an issue. Be sure to demonstrate an effort that you tried to solve the problem yourself.\n\n# Setup\n\nHere\'s what the setup looks like rn:\n- VPS, Debian Stretch, 2 GB RAM\n  - PostgreSQL 9.6. pg_hba.conf contains this:\n\n    ```\n    local   all             all                                      peer\n    # IPv4 local connections:\n    host    nextgen         nextgen          localhost               md5\n    ```\n  - IPFS v0.4.18\n  - user with username nextgen on the server\n- my laptop w/ Linux\n  - Go toolchain installed\n  - node v10.15 & npm\n  - Python 3 (required only for index-generator/fix-metajson.py)\n\nThe programs create their own tables in the DB that they need. Database name is "nextgen".\n\nWhat I did first after getting the server up and running was importing the TPB dump. Download https://thepiratebay.org/static/dump/csv/torrent_dump_full.csv.gz to the import-tpb-dump directory and run `go run`.\n\nThere is a complete database dump available in torrentparadise-staticbackup.torrent, so you don\'t have to do that. This same database dump is available on https://mega.nz/#!ddESlChb!3YBqfxG-a4fwpXzPG3QsXa-C6FeQ9AbNSGXxY7W7xm4. It contains the same data as the torrent, only .xz compressed.\n\n# Usage\n\n## Generate the index\n\nSee `update-index.sh`.\n\n## Spider the DHT\n\nRun `go build` in spider/ to compile and scp the binary it to the server. You can use the systemd service file in `spider/spider.service` to start the spider on server boot.\n\n## Scraping trackers for seed/leech data\n\nRun `go build` in seedleech-daemon/ to compile and scp the binary it to the server. You can use the systemd service file in `seedleech-daemon/seedleech.service`.\n\n\n# Contributing\n\nBefore working on something, open an issue to ask if it would be okay. I would love to [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). \n'
