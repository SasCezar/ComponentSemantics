IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.\n\nIPFS is a distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, this is similar to the original aims of the Web, but IPFS is actually more similar to a single bittorrent swarm exchanging git objects. You can read more about its origins in the paper [IPFS - Content Addressed, Versioned, P2P File System](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/blob/master/papers/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf?raw=true).\n\nIPFS is becoming a new major subsystem of the internet. If built right, it could complement or replace HTTP. It could complement or replace even more. It sounds crazy. It _is_ crazy.\n\n[![Alpha Demo](img/ipfs-alpha-video.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CMxDNuuAiQ)\n\nWant to see more?

You can also explore the [Specs](https://github.com/ipfs/specs) in writing.\n\n### IPFS Papers\n\n- [IPFS - Content Addressed, Versioned, P2P File System (draft 3)](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/blob/master/papers/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf?raw=true)\n- [Specifications](https://github.com/ipfs/specs) (work in progress)\n- see also: https://github.com/ipfs/papers\n\n### IPFS Talks\n\nThis is a short selection of introductory talks. In time we will collect more here.\n\n- 2014-07-21 - [IPFS: The Permanent Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa4pckodM9g) at [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) (first public talk)\n- 2015-02-20 - [IPFS Alpha Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CMxDNuuAiQ)\n- 2015-06-03 - [IPFS Hands on Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h73bd9b5pPA) at Ethereum SV Meetup\n- **2015-10-22 - [IPFS: The Distributed, Permanent Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUVmypx9HGI) at Stanford Seminar (best overview of project)**\n- 2016-09-14 - [Distributed Apps with IPFS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jONZtXMu03w)\n- 2016-10-22 - [The Decentralized Web, IPFS and Filecoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU-n_m-snxQ)\n\nSee full list at [IPFS Media](https://ipfs.io/media/)\n\n## More About IPFS\n\nThe IPFS project seeks to evolve the infrastructure of the Internet and the Web, with many things we\'ve learned from successful systems, like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [BitTorrent](http://bittorrent.org/), [Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia), [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/), and many, many more. This is the sort of thing that would have come out of ARPA/DARPA/IETF/BellLabs in another age. IPFS is a Free Open Source project, with hundreds of contributors.\n\n### Current State of IPFS\n\n**IPFS is a work in progress!**\n\nPlease note that IPFS is a work in progress. It is an ambitious plan to make the internet more free, open, secure, and high performance. It builds on the good ideas of numerous battle-tested distributed systems.\n\nToday, there is one main IPFS Protocol implementation (in [Go](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)) with [more on the way](#protocol-implementations) ([JavaScript](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs), and [Python](https://github.com/ipfs/py-ipfs)).\n\n### Alpha Distribution\n\nIn February of 2015, the [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) implementation was released as an "Alpha Distribution". Since then, go-ipfs has been making regular releases on the road towards Beta. Both [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) and [py-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/py-ipfs) are in progress.\n\n- [Install IPFS Alpha Distribution](https://ipfs.io/docs/install)\n- [Setup IPFS and Getting Started](https://ipfs.io/docs/getting-started/)\n- [Going Online](https://ipfs.io/docs/getting-started/#going-online)\n- [More Examples](https://ipfs.io/docs/examples/)\n\nFor an in-depth tutorial, see a [Hands on Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h73bd9b5pPA).\n\n### Security Issues and Disclosures\n\nThe IPFS protocol and its implementations are still in heavy development. This means that there may be problems in our protocols, or there may be mistakes in our implementations. And -- though IPFS is not production-ready yet -- many people are already running nodes in their machines. So we take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!\n\nIf you find a vulnerability that may affect live deployments -- for example, by exposing a remote execution exploit -- please send your report privately to security@ipfs.io. Please DO NOT file a public issue.\n\nIf the issue is a protocol weakness that cannot be immediately exploited or something not yet deployed, just discuss it openly.\n\n## Project and Community\n\n[![](https://cdn.rawgit.com/jbenet/contribute-ipfs-gif/master/img/contribute.gif)](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nThe IPFS Project is now very large, with hundreds of contributors in our community.
