Example: `wendelladriel.github.io`.  In order to rename, go to you forked repository and click in settings\n\n[![settings.png](https://s14.postimg.org/l9ma6nx01/settings.png)](https://postimg.org/image/uheind425/)\n\nAt this moment the **Web Curriculum** will often be viewable immediately at http://your-github-username.github.io. But you may need do some changes to make you curriculum as you wish.\n\n#### Step 2 - Customize your Web Curriculum\n\nTo customize your **Web Curriculum** you will change only two files:  \n- `_config.yml`: in this file you have to put your personal informations and skills list\n- `css/_variables.sass`: in this file you can change the colors to customize the appearance of your **Web Curriculum**\n\n#### Step 3 - Publish your Web Curriculum\n\nobs: In this stage you can edit your files on the fly by github interface, or if you prefer locally as well.\n\nAfter you made the changes, just `commit` and `push` to your repository and your **Web Curriculum** is ready, just go to http://your-github-username.github.io and see your new awesome **Web Curriculum**!!!\n\n## Changelog\n\nYou can see all the important changes **[here](https://github.com/WendellAdriel/dev-curriculum/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)**\n\n## Contributing\n\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/WendellAdriel/dev-curriculum/.
