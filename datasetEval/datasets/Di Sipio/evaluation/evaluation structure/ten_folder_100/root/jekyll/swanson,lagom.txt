b'# Lagom\n\n> #### *Lagom* is a Swedish word with no direct English equivalent, meaning "just the right amount"\n\nLagom, a [Jekyll][j] blog theme with just the right amount of style. \n\nExtracted lovingly from [http://mdswanson.com][mds] for your enjoyment!\n\n\n\n* Responsive, based on [Skeleton][skeleton]\n* [Font Awesome][font-awesome] for icons\n* Open Sans from [Google web fonts][gfonts]\n* Built-in Atom feed\n\n[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-live--demo-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](http://lagom.mdswanson.com/)\n\n## Action Shots\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Pmzk4j1.png)\n![](http://i.imgur.com/CT2Xvug.png)\n![](http://i.imgur.com/XisjqW1.jpg)\n\n## Installation\n\n- [Fork this repository][fork]\n- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/lagom`\n- Install the [GitHub Pages gem][pages] (includes Jekyll): `bundle install`\n- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll serve`\n\nYou should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.\n\n## Customization\n\nNext you\'ll want to change a few things. Most of them can be changed directly in\n[theme.yml][config]. That\'s where you can add your social links, change the accent\ncolor, stuff like that.\n\nThere\'s a few other places that you\'ll want to change, too:\n\n- [CNAME][cname]: If you\'re using this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, \n  you\'ll want to change this to be the domain you\'re going to use. All that should \n  be in here is a domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).\n- [favicon.png][favicon]: This is the icon in your browser\'s address bar. You should \n  change it to whatever you\'d like.\n- [logo.png][logo]: A square-ish image that appears in the upper-left corner\n\n## Deployment\n\nYou should deploy with [GitHub Pages][pages] - it\'s just easier.\n\nAll you should have to do is rename your repository on GitHub to be\n`username.github.io`. Since everything is on the `gh-pages` branch, you\nshould be able to see your new site at <http://username.github.io>.\n\n## Licensing\n\n[MIT](https://github.com/swanson/lagom/blob/master/LICENSE) with no\nadded caveats, so feel free to use this on your site without linking back to\nme or using a disclaimer or anything silly like that.\n\n## Contact\nI\'d love to hear from you at [@_swanson][twitter]. Feel free to open issues if you\nrun into trouble or have suggestions. Pull Requests always welcome.\n\n[j]: http://jekyllrb.com/\n[mds]: http://mdswanson.com\n[skeleton]: http://www.getskeleton.com/\n[font-awesome]: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/\n[gfonts]: http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans\n[fork]: https://github.com/swanson/lagom/fork\n[config]: https://github.com/swanson/lagom/blob/master/_data/theme.yml\n[cname]: https://github.com/swanson/lagom/blob/master/CNAME\n[favicon]: https://github.com/swanson/lagom/blob/master/favicon.png\n[logo]: https://github.com/swanson/lagom/blob/master/logo.png\n[pages]: http://pages.github.com\n[twitter]: https://twitter.com/_swanson\n[pages]: https://github.com/github/pages-gem\n'
