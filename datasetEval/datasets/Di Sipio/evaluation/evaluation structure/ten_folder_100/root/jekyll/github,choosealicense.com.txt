b"**[ChooseALicense.com](https://choosealicense.com)** aims to provide **accurate**, **non-judgmental**, and **understandable** information about popular **open source licenses** in order to **help people make informed decisions** about the projects they start, maintain, contribute to, and use.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/github/choosealicense.com.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/github/choosealicense.com)\n\nWe catalog [select](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-license) open source licenses with a [Jekyll collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) (in `_licenses`). The catalog is used to render [ChooseALicense.com](https://choosealicense.com) and is regularly vendored into [Licensee](https://github.com/benbalter/licensee), which GitHub uses to provide a [license chooser and license detection](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/), a [licenses API](https://developer.github.com/v3/licenses/), and to [display license descriptions and metadata](https://github.com/blog/2335-open-source-license-descriptions-and-metadata).\n\n## Goals\n\n* Be accurate, non-judgmental, and understandable. Our goal is to help you find a license that meets *your* goals.\n* The homepage should have just enough to help most folks make a decision about what license to use for a project they contribute to.\n* For the rest, the site will contain additional information about licenses common to specific communities and situations.\n* Collaborate with and reinforce other licensing best practices and standards projects.\n* Not comprehensive. Seems like an odd goal, but there are a bajillion licenses out there. We're going to have to filter that down to a small list of those that matter.\n\n## Run It On Your Machine\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com.git\ncd choosealicense.com\n./script/bootstrap\n./script/server\n```\n\nOpen `http://localhost:4000` in your favorite browser.\n\n## Adding a license\n\nFor information on adding a license, see [the CONTRIBUTING file](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-license).\n\n## License metadata\n\nLicenses sit in the `/_licenses` folder. Each license has YAML front matter describing the license's properties. The body of the file contains the text of the license in plain text. The available metadata fields are:\n\n#### Required fields\n\n* `title` - The license full name specified by https://spdx.org/licenses/\n* `spdx-id` - Short identifier specified by https://spdx.org/licenses/\n* `description` - A human-readable description of the license\n* `how` - Instructions on how to implement the license\n* `using` - A list of 3 notable projects using the license with straightforward LICENSE files which serve as examples newcomers can follow and that can be detected by [licensee](https://github.com/benbalter/licensee) in the form of `project_name: license_file_url`\n* `permissions` - Bulleted list of permission rules\n* `conditions` - Bulleted list of condition rules\n* `limitations` - Bulleted list of limitation rules\n\n#### Optional fields\n\n* `featured` - Whether the license should be featured on the main page (defaults to false)\n* `hidden` - Whether the license is neither [popular](https://opensource.org/licenses) nor fills out the [spectrum of licenses](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) from strongly conditional to unconditional (defaults to true)\n* `nickname` - Customary short name if applicable (e.g, GPLv3)\n* `note` - Additional information about the licenses\n* `redirect_from` - Relative path(s) to redirect to the license from, to prevent breaking old URLs\n\n### Auto-populated fields\n\nThe licenses on choosealicense.com are regularly imported to GitHub.com to be used as the list of licenses available when creating a repository. When we create a repository, we will replace certain strings in the license with variables from the repository. These can be used to create accurate copyright notices. The available variables are:\n\n#### Fields\n\n* `fullname` - The full name or username of the repository owner\n* `login` - The repository owner's username\n* `email` - The repository owner's primary email address\n* `project` - The repository name\n* `description` - The description of the repository\n* `year` - The current year\n* `projecturl` - The repository URL or other project website\n\n## License properties\n\nThe license properties (rules) are stored as a bulleted list within the licenses YAML front matter. Each rule has a name e.g., `include-copyright`, a human-readable label, e.g., `Copyright inclusion`, and a description `Include the original copyright with the code`. To add a new rule, simply add it to `_data/rules.yml` and reference it in the appropriate license.\n\n### Rules\n\n#### Permissions\n\n* `commercial-use` - This software and derivatives may be used for commercial purposes.\n* `modifications` - This software may be modified.\n* `distribution` - This software may be distributed.\n* `private-use` - This software may be used and modified in private.\n* `patent-use` - This license provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors.\n\n#### Conditions\n\n* `include-copyright` - A copy of the license and copyright notice must be included with the software.\n* `include-copyright--source` - A copy of the license and copyright notice must be included with the software in source form, but is not required for binaries.\n* `document-changes` - Changes made to the code must be documented.\n* `disclose-source` - Source code must be made available when the software is distributed.\n* `network-use-disclose` - Users who interact with the software via network are given the right to receive a copy of the source code.\n* `same-license` - Modifications must be released under the same license when distributing the software.
