b'# Photography ![OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/photography/tiers/backer/badge.svg?label=backer&color=brightgreen)\nA jekyll website for photographers\n\n## Highlights\n1. Easy setup and you get a site of your own for __free__.\n2. To add new pictures, you need to just upload them. __No code__ changes required.\n3. This I like the most, you get to see EXIF data like __aperture, shutter speed, iso__ etc when you click on any image automagically.\n\n## Quick Start\nIf you know a tad about tech and love taking pictures then this open-source project may help you setup a website to showcase\nall your creations without effort. And not just that, with this you need not pay a single dime to host your website as\nit\'s hosted by GitHub for __free__.\n\n**Just follow the below steps and your website would be live in no time:**\n\n1. Fork this repo by hitting the `Fork` button at the top right corner.\n2. Enable github pages from the repo settings.\n3. Upload your pictures to `images/fulls` and `images/thumbs` directory. _You can do that on github.com itself or you can clone and push the images to your repo._\n4. Add your own custom domain in `CNAME` file or just remove the file if you don\'t own a domain and use the default domain that github provides ([yourusername].github.io/photography).\n5. Update `baseurl` field in `_config.yml` file with whatever domain you used in step 4.\n6. And that\'s it, your website is set. To view, go to [photography.rampatra.com](http://photography.rampatra.com) (or whatever you have in the CNAME file) and if you don\'t have one, you can go to [[yourusername].github.io/photography](http://yourusername.github.io/photography)\n\nAnd of course, you don\'t want my name at the bottom to show up. You can change it in `_config.yml` file as well as few other settings like your google analytics etc.\n \n## ProTips\nI have made this as an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package with [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to __automate image resizing\nand thumbnail generation__. So if you\'re lazy like me then you can just do the following before you push your images to github.\n\n1. Fork and then clone the project to your computer\n2. Go inside the project `$ cd photography`\n3. Install all dependencies by `$ npm install`\n4. Copy all your pictures (possibly jpg, the largest size available, straight from your camera) and put it inside `images` directory\n5. Run `$ gulp` to resize the images and to generate thumbnails automatically\n6. Push your changes to github.com by `$ git add --all` and `$ git commit -m "a nice commit message"` and then finally `$ git push origin master`\n\n### Contact Form\nYou can make the contact form work without the need of any server-side code. Just follow this [article on github](https://github.com/dwyl/html-form-send-email-via-google-script-without-server) which uses a simple google script to send emails or to upload to a google spreadsheet when someone submits the form.\n\n## Credits\nThanks to [AJ](https://twitter.com/ajlkn) for the website template which I enhanced for [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).\n\n## Backers\n\nThank you to all our backers! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f [[Become a backer](https://opencollective.com/photography#backers)]\n\n<a href="https://opencollective.com/photography#backers" target="_blank"><img src="https://opencollective.com/photography/backers.svg?width=890"></a>\n\n<!-- <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rampatra" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" style="height: auto !important;width: auto !important;" ></a> -->\n\n## Sponsors\n\nSupport this project by becoming a sponsor.
