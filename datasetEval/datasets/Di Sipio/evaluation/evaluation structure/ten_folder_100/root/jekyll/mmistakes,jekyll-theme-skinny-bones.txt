b"# Skinny Bones Jekyll Starter\n\nJust a little something I'm using to jump start a site refresh. I like to think of it as a starter for building your own Jekyll site. I purposely keep the styling minimal and bare to make it easier to add your own flare and markup.\n\n![screenshot of Skinny Bones](http://mmistakes.github.io/jekyll-theme-skinny-bones/images/skinny-bones-theme-feature.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## Notable Features\n\n* Jekyll 3.x and GitHub Pages compatible.\n* Stylesheet built using Sass.\n* Data files for easier customization of the site navigation/footer and for supporting multiple authors.\n* Optional Disqus comments, table of contents, social sharing links, and Google AdSense ads.\n* And more.\n\n## More Jekyll Themes\n\nCheck out my more popular Jekyll themes, available as Ruby gems and 100% GitHub Pages compatible.\n\n* [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)\n* [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme)\n* [Basically Basic](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic)\n"
