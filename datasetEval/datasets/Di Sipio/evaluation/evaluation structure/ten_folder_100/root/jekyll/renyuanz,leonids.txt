b"# Update 07/09/2018\n\nI'm planning to refactor Leonids theme!!!\n\nThe goal is really simple: make documentation more intuitive and deployment simpler!!!\n\nHere is the plan:\n\n| Version | Description | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.1 | Jekyll version deployable with gem | 07/15/2018 |\n| 1.2 | New features: Pagination, Prev/Next post | 07/22/2018 |\n| 2.0 | Gatsby or Vuepress version (vote in Issues) | who knows... |\n\nAs the project was and will be designed to improve your writing experience, only documentation, gem, deployment process with CI relevant PRs are acceptable in the future.\n\nI want you to know how much I value your support.\n\nShare it to your timeline!\n\n# Update 05/06/2016\n\nImportant! It's better to download the gzipped files instead of forking the repo. I would really appreciate if you could give me a star. \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\n\nThis project is under MIT license, so feel free to make it your own.\n\n# Leonids Jekyll Themes\n\n**[Leonids](http://renyuanz.github.io/leonids)** is a clean Jekyll theme perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog.\n\n## What is Leonids?\n\n* Responsive templates.
