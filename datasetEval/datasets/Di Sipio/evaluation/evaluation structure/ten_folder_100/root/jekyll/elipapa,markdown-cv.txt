b"markdown-cv\n===========\n\nA curriculum vitae maintained in plain text and rendered to html and pdf using CSS.\n\nFor more details see the [project page](http://elipapa.github.io/markdown-cv) or the blog post on [why I switched to markdown for my CV](http://elipapa.github.io/blog/why-i-switched-to-markdown-for-my-cv.html).\n\n***\n\n## Usage\n\nTo start, simply [fork the markdown-cv repo](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv)\n\n![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)\n\nand then [edit directly in github](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) the `index.md` file\n\n![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/edit-file-edit-button.png)\n\nadding your skills, jobs and education.\n\n![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/edit-readme-light.png)\n\nTo transform your plain text CV into a beautiful looking HTML page and share it you then have two options:\n\n## 1) Using Github Pages to publish it online\n\n1. Delete the existing `gh-pages` branch from your fork. It will only contain this webpage. You can either use git or [the github web interface](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/#deleting-a-branch)\n2. Create a new branch called `gh-pages` (which will then be a copy of master)\n3. Head to *yourusername*.github.io/markdown-cv to see your CV live.\n\nAny change you want to make to your CV from then on would have to be done on the `gh-pages` branch and will be immediately rendered by Github Pages.\n\n\n## 2) Build it locally and print a PDF\n1. [install jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on your computer. `gem install jekyll` will do for most users.\n2. Clone your fork on your computer\n3. Type `jekyll serve` and you'll be able to see your CV on your local host (the default address is http://localhost:4000).\n4. You can edit the `index.md` file and see changes live in your browser.\n5. To print a PDF, just press *Print*. Print and web CSS media queries should take care of the styling.\n\n\n### Change the style\n\nThe included CSS renders CV in different styles:\n\n- `kjhealy` the original default, inspired by [kjhealy's vita\ntemplate](https://github.com/kjhealy/kjh-vita)\n- `davewhipp` is a tweaked version of `kjhealy`, with bigger fonts and dates\n  right aligned\n\nTo change the default style, one needs to simply change the variable in the\n`_config.yml` file.\n\nAny other styling is possible. More CSS style contributions and forks are welcome!\n\n\n### Author\n\nEliseo Papa ([Twitter](http://twitter.com/elipapa)/[GitHub](http://github.com/elipapa)/[website](https://elipapa.github.io)).\n\n![Eliseo Papa](https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/eae1f0c01afda2bed9ce9cb88f6873f6?s=100)\n\n### License\n\n[MIT License](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv/blob/master/LICENSE)\n"
