b"# Resume template\n\n*A simple Jekyll + GitHub Pages powered resume template.*\n\n![img](images/screenshot.png)\n\n## Docs\n\n### Running locally\n\nTo test locally, run the following in your terminal:\n\n1. Clone repo locally\n1. `bundle install`\n2. `bundle exec jekyll serve`\n3. Open your browser to `localhost:4000`\n\n### Customizing\n\nFirst you'll want to fork the repo to your own account. Then clone it locally and customize, or use the GitHub web editor to customize.\n\n#### Options/configuration\n\nMost of the basic customization will take place in the `/_config.yml` file. Here is a list of customizations available via `/_config.yml`:\n\n[...write these out...]\n\n#### Editing content\n\nMost of the content configuration will take place in the `/_layouts/resume.html` file. Simply edit the markup there accordingly\n\n### Publishing to GitHub Pages for free\n\n[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) will host this for free with your GitHub account. Just make sure you're using a `gh-pages` branch, and the site will automatically be available at `yourusername.github.io/resume-template` (you can rename the repo to resume for your own use if you want it to be available at `yourusername.github.io/resume`). You can also add a CNAME if you want it to be available at a custom domain...\n\n### Configuring with your own domain name\n\nTo setup your GH Pages site with a custom domain, [follow the instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) on the GitHub Help site for that topic.\n\n### Themes\n\nRight now resume-template only has one theme. More are coming :soon: though. :heart:\n\n## Roadmap\n\nA feature roadmap is [available here](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template/projects/1).
