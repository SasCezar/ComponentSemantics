b'# The Hacker theme\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pages-themes/hacker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pages-themes/hacker) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-theme-hacker.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-theme-hacker)\n\n*Hacker is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages. You can [preview the theme to see what it looks like](http://pages-themes.github.io/hacker), or even [use it today](#usage).*\n\n![Thumbnail of Hacker](thumbnail.png)\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use the Hacker theme:\n\n1. Add the following to your site\'s `_config.yml`:\n\n    ```yml\n    theme: jekyll-theme-hacker\n    ```\n\n2. Optionally, if you\'d like to preview your site on your computer, add the following to your site\'s `Gemfile`:\n\n    ```ruby\n    gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins\n    ```\n\n## Customizing\n\n### Configuration variables\n\nHacker will respect the following variables, if set in your site\'s `_config.yml`:\n\n```yml\ntitle: [The title of your site]\ndescription: [A short description of your site\'s purpose]\n```\n\nAdditionally, you may choose to set the following optional variables:\n\n```yml\nshow_downloads: ["true" or "false" to indicate whether to provide a download URL]\ngoogle_analytics: [Your Google Analytics tracking ID]\n```\n\n### Stylesheet\n\nIf you\'d like to add your own custom styles:\n\n1. Create a file called `/assets/css/style.scss` in your site\n2. Add the following content to the top of the file, exactly as shown:\n    ```scss\n    ---\n    ---\n\n    @import "{{ site.theme }}";\n    ```\n3. Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you\'d like immediately after the `@import` line\n\n*Note: If you\'d like to change the theme\'s Sass variables, you must set new values before the `@import` line in your stylesheet.*\n\n### Layouts\n\nIf you\'d like to change the theme\'s HTML layout:\n\n1. [Copy the original template](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) from the theme\'s repository<br />(*Pro-tip: click "raw" to make copying easier*)\n2. Create a file called `/_layouts/default.html` in your site\n3. Paste the default layout content copied in the first step\n4. Customize the layout as you\'d like\n\n### Overriding GitHub-generated URLs\n\nTemplates often rely on URLs supplied by GitHub such as links to your repository or links to download your project. If you\'d like to override one or more default URLs:\n\n1. Look at [the template source](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) to determine the name of the variable. It will be in the form of `{{ site.github.zip_url }}`.\n2. Specify the URL that you\'d like the template to use in your site\'s `_config.yml`. For example, if the variable was `site.github.url`, you\'d add the following:\n    ```yml\n    github:\n      zip_url: http://example.com/download.zip\n      another_url: another value\n    ```\n3. When your site is built, Jekyll will use the URL you specified, rather than the default one provided by GitHub.\n\n*Note: You must remove the `site.` prefix, and each variable name (after the `github.`) should be indent with two space below `github:`.*\n\nFor more information, see [the Jekyll variables documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/).\n\n## Roadmap\n\nSee the [open issues](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).\n\n## Project philosophy\n\nThe Hacker theme is intended to make it quick and easy for GitHub Pages users to create their first (or 100th) website. The theme should meet the vast majority of users\' needs out of the box, erring on the side of simplicity rather than flexibility, and provide users the opportunity to opt-in to additional complexity if they have specific needs or wish to further customize their experience (such as adding custom CSS or modifying the default layout). It should also look great, but that goes without saying.\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing to Hacker? We\'d love your help. Hacker is an open source project, built one contribution at a time by users like you. See [the CONTRIBUTING file](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute.\n\n### Previewing the theme locally\n\nIf you\'d like to preview the theme locally (for example, in the process of proposing a change):\n\n1. Clone down the theme\'s repository (`git clone https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker`)\n2. `cd` into the theme\'s directory\n3. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies\n4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server\n5. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the theme\n\n### Running tests\n\nThe theme contains a minimal test suite, to ensure a site with the theme would build successfully. To run the tests, simply run `script/cibuild`. You\'ll need to run `script/bootstrap` one before the test script will work.\n'
