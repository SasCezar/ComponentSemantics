This slows down generation of the website significantly! We include some tools to temporarily exclude the blog posts that you're not working on out of the way.\n\n```bash\nbundle exec rake isolate[filename-of-blogpost]\n```\n\nWhen you're done working on the site, run the following command to move the posts back again:\n\n```bash\nbundle exec rake integrate\n```\n"
