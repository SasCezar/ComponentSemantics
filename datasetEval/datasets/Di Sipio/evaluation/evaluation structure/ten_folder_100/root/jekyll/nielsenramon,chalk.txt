You need to deploy your working branch (can be any branch, for xxx.github.io users: use another branch than `master`) with the `npm run publish` command. Reason for this is because Chalk uses Jekyll plugins that aren't supported by GitHub pages. The `npm run publish` command will automatically build the entire project, then push it to the `gh-pages` branch of your repo. The script creates that branch for you so no need to create it yourself. Also, if you are developing a **project site**, you must set the `baseurl` in `_config.yml` to the name of your repository.\n\nYou can find more info on how to use the `gh-pages` branch and a custom domain [here](https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/).\n\n[View this](https://github.com/nielsenramon/kickster#automated-deployment-with-circle-ci) for more info about automated deployment with Circle CI.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
