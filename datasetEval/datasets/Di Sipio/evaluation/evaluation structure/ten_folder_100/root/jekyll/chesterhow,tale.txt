b'# Tale\n\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/tale.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/tale)\n\nTale is a minimal Jekyll theme curated for storytellers. Checkout the demo [here](https://chesterhow.github.io/tale/).\n\n![Tale screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/pXZrtmo.png)\n\n## Features\n- Easy installation\n- Compatible with GitHub Pages\n- Responsive design (looks just as good on mobile)\n- Syntax highlighting, with the help of Pygments\n- Markdown and HTML text formatting\n- Pagination of posts\n- [Disqus comments (can be enabled if needed)](#enabling-comments)\n\n## Installation\nThere are 3 ways to install this theme\n\n1. Install it as a Ruby Gem (for self-hosted sites)\n2. Install it with the `jekyll-remote-theme` plugin (for GitHub Pages hosted sites)\n3. Fork the project directly\n\n### Ruby Gem method\n1. Add this line to your `Gemfile`:\n\n```ruby\ngem "tale"\n```\n\n2. Install the theme\'s gems and dependencies:\n\n```bash\n$ bundle\n```\n\n3. In `_config.yml` add these lines:\n\n```yaml\ntheme:      tale\n\npermalink:  /:year-:month-:day/:title\npaginate:   5\n```\n\nRemove any other `theme:` lines.\n\n4. Rename `index.md` to `index.html`. Without this, the `jekyll-paginate` gem will not work.\n\n5. In `about.md`, change the `layout:` field to `post`:\n\n```Markdown\nlayout: post\n```\n\n### GitHub Pages method\n1. Add these 2 lines in to your `Gemfile`:\n\n```ruby\ngem "jekyll-remote-theme"\ngem "jekyll-paginate"\n```\n\n2. Install the newly added gems:\n\n```bash\n$ bundle\n```\n\n3. In `_config.yml` add these lines:\n\n```yaml\nremote_theme: chesterhow/tale\n\npermalink:    /:year-:month-:day/:title\npaginate:     5\n\nplugins:\n  - jekyll-paginate\n  - jekyll-remote-theme\n```\n\nRemove any other `theme:` or `remote_theme:` lines.\n\n4. Rename `index.md` to `index.html`. Without this, the `jekyll-paginate` gem will not work.\n\n5. In `about.md`, change the `layout:` field to `post`:\n\n```Markdown\nlayout: post\n```\n\n### Fork method\n1. Fork this repository\n\n2. Delete the unnecessary files/folders: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `tale.gemspec`\n\n3. Delete the `baseurl` line in `_config.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nbaseurl:  "/tale"   # delete this line\n```\n\n## Usage\nOnce you\'ve installed the theme, you\'re ready to work on your Jekyll site. To start off, I would recommend updating `_config.yml` with your site\'s details.\n\nTo build and serve your site, run:\n\n```bash\n$ bundle exec jekyll serve\n```\n\nAnd you\'re all set! Head over to http://127.0.0.1:4000/ to see your site in action.\n\n### Enabling Comments\nComments are disabled by default. To enable them, look for the following line in `_config.yml` and change `jekyll-tale` to your site\'s Disqus id.\n\n```yml\ndisqus: jekyll-tale\n```\n\nNext, add `comments: true` to the YAML front matter of the posts which you would like to enable comments for.\n\n## Contributing\nFound a bug or have a suggestion?
