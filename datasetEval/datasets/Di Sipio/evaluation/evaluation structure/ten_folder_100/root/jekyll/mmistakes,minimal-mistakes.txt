As the name implies, styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.\n\n:sparkles: See what\'s new in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).\n\n**If you enjoy this theme, please consider [supporting me](https://www.paypal.me/mmistakes) to continue developing and maintaining it.**\n\n[![Support via PayPal](https://cdn.rawgit.com/twolfson/paypal-github-button/1.0.0/dist/button.svg)](https://www.paypal.me/mmistakes)\n\n**Note:** The theme uses the [jekyll-include-cache](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-include-cache) plugin which will need to be installed in your `Gemfile` and added to the `plugins` array of `_config.yml`. Otherwise you\'ll throw `Unknown tag \'include_cached\'` errors at build.\n\n[![Minimal Mistakes live preview][2]][1]\n\n[1]: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/\n[2]: screenshot.png (live preview)\n\n![layout examples](screenshot-layouts.png)\n\n## Notable features\n\n- Bundled as a "theme gem" for easier installation/upgrading.\n- Compatible with GitHub Pages.\n- Support for Jekyll\'s built-in Sass/SCSS preprocessor.\n- Nine different skins (color variations).\n- Several responsive layout options (single, archive index, search, splash, and paginated home page).\n- Optimized for search engines with support for [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) and [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) data.\n- Optional [header images](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#headers), [custom sidebars](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#sidebars), [table of contents](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/#table-of-contents), [galleries](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/#gallery), related posts, [breadcrumb links](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#breadcrumb-navigation-beta), [navigation lists](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/#navigation-list), and more.\n- Commenting support (powered by [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments), Google+, [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), static-based via [Staticman](https://staticman.net/), and [utterances](https://utteranc.es/)).\n- [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) support.\n- UI localized text in English (default), Brazilian Portuguese (Portugu\xc3\xaas brasileiro), Catalan, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, French (Fran\xc3\xa7ais), German (Deutsch), Greek, Hindi (\xe0\xa4\xb9\xe0\xa4\xbf\xe0\xa4\x82\xe0\xa4\xa6\xe0\xa5\x80), Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian (Italiano), Japanese, Korean, Malayalam, Nepali (Nepalese), Persian (\xd9\x81\xd8\xa7\xd8\xb1\xd8\xb3\xdb\x8c), Polish, Punjabi (\xe0\xa8\xaa\xe0\xa9\xb0\xe0\xa8\x9c\xe0\xa8\xbe\xe0\xa8\xac\xe0\xa9\x80), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish (Espa\xc3\xb1ol), Swedish, Thai, Turkish (T\xc3\xbcrk\xc3\xa7e), and Vietnamese.\n\n## Skins (color variations)\n\nThis theme comes in nine different skins (including the default one).\n\n| `air` | `contrast` | `dark` |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![air skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/assets/images/air-skin-archive.png) | ![contrast skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/assets/images/contrast-skin-archive.png) | ![dark skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/assets/images/dark-skin-archive.png) |\n\n| `dirt` | `mint` | `sunrise` |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![dirt skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/assets/images/dirt-skin-archive.png) | ![mint skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/assets/images/mint-skin-archive.png) | ![sunrise skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/assets/images/sunrise-skin-archive.png) |\n\n| `aqua` | `neon` | `plum` |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![aqua skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/assets/images/aqua-skin-archive.png) | ![neon skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/assets/images/neon-skin-archive.png) | ![plum skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/assets/images/plum-skin-archive.png) |\n\n## Demo pages\n\n| Name                                        | Description                                           |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Post with Header Image][header-image-post] | A post with a large header image. |\n| [HTML Tags and Formatting Post][html-tags-post] | A variety of common markup showing how the theme styles them. |\n| [Syntax Highlighting Post][syntax-post] | Post displaying highlighted code. |\n| [Post with a Gallery][gallery-post] | A post showing several images wrapped in `<figure>` elements. |\n| [Sample Collection Page][sample-collection] | Single page from a collection. |\n| [Categories Archive][categories-archive] | Posts grouped by category. |\n| [Tags Archive][tags-archive] | Posts grouped by tag. |\n\nAdditional sample posts are available under [posts archive][year-archive] on the demo site.

Yet all of the necessary directories will be read and processed during Jekyll\xe2\x80\x99s build process.\n\nThis allows for easier installation and updating as you don\'t have to manage any of the theme files. To install:\n\n1. Add the following to your `Gemfile`:\n\n   ```ruby\n   gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"\n   ```\n\n2. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) command:\n\n   ```bash\n   bundle\n   ```\n\n3. Set the `theme` in your project\'s Jekyll `_config.yml` file:\n\n   ```yaml\n   theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll\n   ```\n\nTo update the theme run `bundle update`.\n\n### Remote theme method\n\nRemote themes are similar to Gem-based themes, but do not require `Gemfile` changes or whitelisting making them ideal for sites hosted with GitHub Pages.\n\nTo install:\n\n1. Create/replace the contents of your `Gemfile` with the following:\n\n   ```ruby\n   source "https://rubygems.org"\n\n   gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins\n   ```\n\n2. Add `jekyll-include-cache` to the `plugins` array of your `_config.yml`.\n\n3. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) command:\n\n   ```bash\n   bundle\n   ```\n\n4. Add `remote_theme: "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.17.2"` to your `_config.yml` file. Remove any other `theme:` or `remote_theme:` entry.\n\n**Looking for an example?** Fork the [Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter) for the quickest method of getting a GitHub Pages hosted site up and running. Replace sample content with your own and configure as needed.\n\n## Usage\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to configure, customize, add/migrate content, and more read the [theme\'s documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nHaving trouble working with the theme? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or [fixing a bug](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.\n\nMinimal Mistakes has been designed as a base for you to customize and fit your site\'s unique needs. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If it\'s not something that most people will use, I probably won\'t consider it. When in doubt ask. \n\nThis goes for author sidebar links and "share button" additions -- I have no intention of merging in every possibly option, the essentials are there to get you started :smile:.\n\n### Pull Requests\n\nWhen submitting a pull request:\n\n1. Clone the repo.\n2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `my-awesome-new-feature`).\n3. Open a pull request on GitHub and describe the feature or fix.\n\nTheme documentation and demo pages can be found in the [`/docs`](docs) if submitting improvements, typo corrections, etc.\n\n## Development\n\nTo set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.\n\nTo test the theme, run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/test/`. This starts a Jekyll server using content in the `test/` directory. As modifications are made to the theme and test site, it will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.\n\n---\n\n## Credits\n\n### Creator\n\n**Michael Rose**\n\n- <https://mademistakes.com>\n- <https://twitter.com/mmistakes>\n- <https://github.com/mmistakes>\n\n### Icons + Demo Images:\n\n- [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) -- Garrett Knoll, Arthur Shlain, and [tracy tam](https://thenounproject.com/tracytam)\n- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)\n- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)\n\n### Other:\n\n- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)\n- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)\n- [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/)\n- [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/)\n- [Magnific Popup](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/)\n- [FitVids.JS](http://fitvidsjs.com/)\n- [GreedyNav.js](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/GreedyNav)\n- [Smooth Scroll](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll)\n- [Gumshoe](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gumshoe)\n- [jQuery throttle / debounce](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/)\n- [Lunr](http://lunrjs.com)\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2019 Michael Rose and contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
