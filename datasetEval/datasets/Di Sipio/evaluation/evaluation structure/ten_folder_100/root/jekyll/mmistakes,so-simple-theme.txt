If you\'re hosting with [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) you can install as a [remote theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) or directly copy all of the theme files (see [structure](#structure) below) into your project.\n\n### Ruby Gem Method\n\n1. Add this line to your Jekyll site\'s `Gemfile` (or [create one](example/Gemfile)):\n\n   ```ruby\n   gem "jekyll-theme-so-simple"\n   ```\n\n2. Add this line to your Jekyll site\'s `_config.yml` file:\n\n   ```yaml\n   theme: jekyll-theme-so-simple\n   ```\n\n3. Then run [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to install the theme gem and dependencies:\n\n   ```terminal\n   bundle install\n   ```\n\n### GitHub Pages Method\n\nGitHub Pages has added [full support](https://github.com/blog/2464-use-any-theme-with-github-pages) for any GitHub-hosted theme.\n\n1. Replace `gem "jekyll"` with:\n\n   ```ruby\n   gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins\n   ```\n\n2. Run `bundle update` and verify that all gems install properly.\n\n3. Add `remote_theme: "mmistakes/so-simple-theme@3.2.0"` to your\n   `_config.yml` file. Remove any other `theme:` or `remote_theme:` entries.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Your Jekyll site should be viewable immediately at <http://USERNAME.github.io>. If it\'s not, you can force a rebuild by pushing empty commits to GitHub (see below for more details).\n\nIf you\'re hosting several Jekyll based sites under the same GitHub username you will have to use Project Pages instead of User Pages. Essentially you rename the repo to something other than **USERNAME.github.io** and create a `gh-pages` branch off of `master`. For more details on how this works, check [GitHub\'s documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).\n\n#### Remove the Unnecessary\n\nIf you forked or downloaded the [`so-simple-theme` repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) you can safely remove the following files and folders:\n\n* `.github`\n* `docs`\n* `example`\n* `.editorconfig`\n* `.gitattributes`\n* `banner.js`\n* `CHANGELOG.md`\n* `Gemfile`\n* `jekyll-theme-so-simple.gemspec`\n* `package.json`\n* `Rakefile`\n* `README.md`\n* `README-OLD.md`\n* `screenshot.png`\n\n## Upgrading\n\nIf you\'re using the Ruby Gem or remote theme versions of So Simple, upgrading is fairly painless.\n\nTo check which version you are currently using, view the source of your built site and you should something similar to:\n\n```\n<!--\n    So Simple Jekyll Theme 3.0.0\n    Copyright 2013-2018 Michael Rose - mademistakes.com | @mmistakes\n    Free for personal and commercial use under the MIT license\n    https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/blob/master/LICENSE\n-->\n```\n\nThis will be at the top of every `.html` file, `/assets/css/main.css`, and `/assets/js/main.js`.\n\n### Ruby Gem\n\nSimply run `bundle update` if you\'re using Bundler (have a `Gemfile`) or `gem update jekyll-theme-so-simple` if you\'re not.\n\n### Remote Theme\n\nVerify you have the [latest version](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/releases) assigned in `_config.yml`\n\n```\nremote_theme: "mmistakes/so-simple-theme@3.2.0"\n```\n\nNote: If `@x.x.x` is omitted the theme\'s current `master` branch will be used. It is advised to ["lock" `remote_theme`](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme#declaring-your-theme) at a specific version to avoid introducing breaking changes to your site.\n\nThe next step requires rebuilding your [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site so it can pull down the latest theme updates. This can be achieved by pushing up a commit to your GitHub repo.\n\nAn empty commit will get the job done too if you don\'t have anything to push at the moment:\n\n```terminal\ngit commit --allow-empty -m "Force rebuild of site"\n```\n\n### Use Git\n\nIf you want to get the most out of the Jekyll + GitHub Pages workflow, then you\'ll need to utilize Git. To pull down theme updates manually you must first ensure there\'s an upstream remote. If you forked the theme\'s repo then you\'re likely good to go.\n\nTo double check, run `git remote -v` and verify that you can fetch from `origin https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme.git`.\n\nTo add it you can do the following:\n\n```terminal\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme.git\n```\n\n#### Pull Down Updates\n\nNow you can pull any commits made to theme\'s `master` branch with:\n\n```terminal\ngit pull upstream master\n```\n\nDepending on the amount of customizations you\'ve made after forking, there\'s likely to be merge conflicts. Work through any conflicting files Git flags, staging the changes you wish to keep, and then commit them.\n\n### Update Files Manually\n\nAnother way of dealing with updates is [downloading the theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/archive/master.zip) --- replacing your layouts, includes, and assets with the newer ones manually. To be sure that you don\'t miss any changes review the theme\'s [commit history](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/commits/master) to see what has changed.\n\nHere\'s a quick checklist of the important folders/files you\'ll want to be mindful of:\n\n| Name                   |                                                                                |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `_layouts`             | Replace all. Apply edits if you customized any layouts.                        |\n| `_includes`            | Replace all. Apply edits if you customized any includes.                       |\n| `assets`               | Replace all. Apply edits if you customized stylesheets or scripts.             |\n| `_sass`                | Replace all. Apply edits if you customized Sass partials.                      |\n| `_data/navigation.yml` | Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions. |\n| `_data/text.yml`       | Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions. |\n| `_config.yml`          | Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions. |\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If you\'re not seeing the latest version, be sure to flush browser and CDN caches. Depending on your hosting environment older versions of `/assets/css/main.css`, `/assets/js/main.min.js`, or `*.html` files may be cached.\n\n## Structure\n\nLayouts, includes, Sass partials, and data files are all placed in their default locations. Stylesheets and scripts can be found in `assets`, and a few development related files in the project\'s root directory.\n\n**Please note:** If you installed So Simple via the Ruby Gem or remote theme methods, theme files found in `/_layouts`, `/_includes`, `/_sass`, and `/assets` will be missing from your project. This is normal as they are bundled with the [`jekyll-theme-so-simple`](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-so-simple) gem.\n\n```\n\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 _data               # data files\n|  \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 navigation.yml   # navigation bar links\n|  \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 text.yml         # theme text\n\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 _includes           # theme includes\n\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 _layouts            # theme layouts (see below for usage)\n\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 _sass               # Sass partials\n\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 assets\n|  \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 css\n|  |  \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 main.scss\n|  \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 js\n|     \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 main.min.js\n\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 _config.yml         # sample configuration\n\xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 index.md            # sample home page (recent posts/not paginated)\n```\n\n### Starting Fresh\n\nAfter creating a `Gemfile` and installing the theme you\'ll need to add and edit the following files:\n\n* [`_config.yml`](_config.yml)\n* [`/_data/navigation.yml`](_data/navigation.yml)\n* [`/_data/text.yml`](_data/text.yml)\n* [`index.md`](index.md)\n\n**Note:** Consult the [**pagination**](#pagination) documentation below for instructions on how to enable it on the home page.\n\n### Starting from `jekyll new`\n\nUsing the `jekyll new` command will get you up and running the quickest.\n\nEdit your `Gemfile` and `_config.yml` files following the [installation guide](#installation) above and [configuration guide](#configuring) below, then create `_data/text.yml` as instructed earlier.\n\n## Configuring\n\nConfiguration of site-wide elements (`locale`, `title`, `description`, `url`, `logo`, `author`, etc.) happens in your project\'s `_config.yml`. See the [example configuration](example/_config.yml) in this repo for additional reference.\n\n| Name          | Description                                                              | Example                             |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |\n| `locale`      | Primary language for the site.                                           | `"en-us"`                           |\n| `title`       | Site\'s title.                                                            | `"My Awesome Site"`                 |\n| `description` | A short description.                                                     | `"This is my site, it is awesome."` |\n| `baseurl`     | Used to test the website under the same base url it will be deployed to. | `/my-base-path`                     |\n| `url`         | The full URL to your site.                                               | `"https://your-site.com"`           |\n| `logo`        | Path to a site-wide logo used in masthead.                                | `/images/your-logo.png`             |\n\n### Site Skin\n\nThree skins (default, light, and dark) are available to change the color palette of the theme.\n\n| `default.css` | `light.css` | `dark.css` |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![default skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/images/default-skin.png) | ![light skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/images/light-skin.png) | ![dark skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/images/dark-skin.png) |\n\n```yaml\nskin: "/assets/css/skins/default.css"\nskin: "/assets/css/skins/light.css"\nskin: "/assets/css/skins/dark.css"\n```\n\nTo use a custom skin other than the ones provided:\n\n1. Copy and rename [`/assets/css/skins/default.scss`](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/blob/master/assets/css/skins/default.scss) to your local repo.\n2. Override and customize Sass variables as you see fit.\n3. Update the `skin` path in `_config.yml` to reference this new skin `.css` file.\n\n### Site Locale\n\n**`site.locale`** is used to declare the primary language for each web page within the site.\n\n_Example:_ locale: `"en-US"` sets the lang attribute for the site to the United States flavor of English, while `en-GB` would be for the United Kingdom style of English. Country codes are optional and the shorter variation `locale: "en"` is also acceptable. To find your language and country codes check this [reference table](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee825488(v=cs.20).aspx>).\n\nProperly setting the locale is important for associating localized text found in the text data file.\n\n**Note:** The theme defaults to text in English (`en`, `en-US`, `en-GB`). If you change locale in `_config.yml` to something else be sure to add the corresponding locale key and translated text to [`_data/text.yml`](_data/text.yml).\n\n### Site URL\n\nThe base hostname and protocol for your site. If you\'re hosting with GitHub Pages this will be something like `url: "https://github.io.mmistakes"` or `url: "https://your-site.com"` if you have a custom domain name.\n\nGitHub Pages now [forces `https://` for new sites](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/), so be mindful of that when setting your URL to avoid mixed-content warnings.\n\n**Note:** Jekyll overrides the value of `url` with `http://localhost:4000` when running `jekyll serve` locally in development. If you want to avoid this behavior set `JEKYLL_ENV=production` to [force the environment](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#specifying-a-jekyll-environment-at-build-time) to production.\n\n### Site Base URL\n\nThis option causes all kinds of confusion in the Jekyll community. If you\'re not hosting your site as a [GitHub Project Page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) or in a subfolder (e.g., `/blog`), then don\'t mess with it.\n\nIn the case of the **So Simple** demo site it\'s hosted on GitHub at <https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme>. To correctly set this base path I\'d use `url: "https://mmistakes.github.io"` and `baseurl: "/so-simple-theme"`.\n\nFor more information on how to properly use `site.url` and `site.baseurl` as intended by the Jekyll maintainers, check [Parker Moore\'s post on the subject](https://byparker.com/blog/2014/clearing-up-confusion-around-baseurl/).\n\n**Note:** When using `baseurl` remember to include it as part of your link and asset paths in your content. Values of `url:` and `baseurl: "/blog"` would make your local site visible at <http://localhost:4000/blog> and not <http://localhost:4000>. You can either prepend all your asset and internal link paths with `{{ site.baseurl }}` or use Jekyll\'s `relative_url`.\n\nTo use the example values above the following image path of `{{ \'/images/my-image.jpg\' | relative_url }}` would output correctly as `http://localhost:4000/blog/images/my-image.jpg`.\n\nWithout the `relative_url` filter that asset path would be missing `/blog` and you\'d have a broken image on your page.\n\n### Date Format\n\nYou can change the default date format by specifying `date_format` in `_config.yml`. It accepts any of the standard [Liquid date formats](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/date/).\n\nFor example the default value of `"%B %-d, %Y"` could be changed like so:\n\n```yaml\ndate_format: "%Y-%m-%d"\n```\n\n### Reading Time\n\nEnable estimated reading time snippets site-wide with `read_time: true`. **`200`** has been set as the default words per minute value \xe2\x80\x94 which can be changed via `words_per_minute` in your `_config.yml` file.\n\n```yaml\nread_time: true\nwords_per_minute: 200\n```\n\n### Mathematics\n\nEnable [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org) (a JavaScript display engine for mathematics) site-wide with `mathjax: true`.\n\n### Google Fonts\n\nEasily use [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/) throughout your site by replacing the font `name` and `weights` accordingly. Suggested font pairings are as follows:\n\n```yaml\ngoogle_fonts:\n  - name: "Source Sans Pro"\n    weights: "400,400i,700,700i"\n  - name: "Lora"\n    weights: "400,400i,700,700i"\n```\n\n**Note:** If other font families are used, be sure to add, then override the following SCSS variables in `/assets/css/main.scss` with the `font-family` values Google provides.\n\n```scss\n$serif-font-family: "Lora", serif;\n$sans-serif-font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif;\n$monospace-font-family: Menlo, Consolas, Monaco, "Courier New", Courier,\n  monospace;\n\n$base-font-family: $sans-serif-font-family;\n$headline-font-family: $sans-serif-font-family;\n$title-font-family: $serif-font-family;\n$description-font-family: $serif-font-family;\n$meta-font-family: $serif-font-family;\n```\n\nSee [stylesheet documentation](#customizing-sass-scss) below for more information on overriding the theme\'s default variables.\n\n### Pagination\n\nBreak up the main listing of posts on the home page across multiple pages by [enabling pagination](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/).\n\n1. Include the [`jekyll-paginate`][jekyll-paginate] plugin in your `Gemfile`.\n\n   ```ruby\n   group :jekyll_plugins do\n     gem "jekyll-paginate"\n   end\n   ```\n\n2. Add `jekyll-paginate` to the `plugins` array (previously `gems`) in your `_config.yml` file and the following pagination settings:\n\n   ```yaml\n   paginate: 10  # amount of posts to show per page\n   paginate_path: /page:num/\n   ```\n\n3. Create `index.html` (or rename `index.md`) in the root of your project and add the following front matter:\n\n   ```yaml\n   layout: home\n   paginate: true\n   ```\n\n### Search\n\nTo index the full content of your documents for use in a [search page](#layout-search), set `search_full_content` to `true` in `_config.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nsearch_full_content: true\n```\n\n**Note:** Large amounts of posts will increase the size of the search index, impacting page load performance. Setting `search_full_content` to `false` (the default) restricts indexing to the first 50 words of body content.\n\n### Taxonomy Pages\n\nBy default, category and tags added to a post are not linked to taxonomy archive pages. To enable this behavior and link to pages with posts grouped by category or tag, add the following:\n\n```yaml\ncategory_archive_path: "/categories/#"\ntag_archive_path: "/tags/#"\n```\n\nThese paths should mimic the permalinks used for your [**categories**](#layout-categories) and [**tags archive**](#layout-tags) pages. The `#` at the end is necessary to target the correct taxonomy section on the pages.\n\nFor example if you were to create `categories.md` with the following front matter:\n\n```yaml\ntitle: Categories Archive\nlayout: categories\npermalink: /foo/\n```\n\nYou\'d need to change `category_archive_path` to `"/foo/#` for category links to function properly.\n\n**Note:** You can create dedicated category and tag pages manually with [`layout: category`](#layout-category) and [`layout: tag`](#layout-tag). Or use plugins like [**jekyll-archives**][jekyll-archives] or [**jekyll-paginate-v2**](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-AUTOPAGES.md) to generate them automatically.\n\n### Comments (via Disqus)\n\nIf you have a [**Disqus**](https://disqus.com/) account, you can show a comments section below each post.\n\nTo enable Disqus comments, add your [Disqus shortname](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208) to your project\'s `_config.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndisqus:\n  shortname: my_disqus_shortname\n```\n\nComments only appear in production when built with the following [environment value](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#specifying-a-jekyll-environment-at-build-time): `JEKYLL_ENV=production` to avoid polluting your Disqus account with `localhost` content.\n\nIf you don\'t want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post\'s front matter.\n\n### Google Analytics\n\nTo enable [**Google Analytics**](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), add your tracking ID to `_config.yml` like so:\n\n```yaml\ngoogle_analytics: UA-NNNNNNNN-N\n```\n\nSimilar to Disqus comments above, the Google Analytics tracking script will only appear in production when using the following environment value: `JEKYLL_ENV=production`.\n\n### Other\n\nFor more configuration options be sure to consult the documentation for:\n[**jekyll-seo-tag**][jekyll-seo-tag], [**jekyll-feed**][jekyll-feed],\n[**jekyll-paginate**][jekyll-paginate], and [**jekyll-sitemap**][jekyll-sitemap].\n\n---\n\n## Layouts\n\nThis theme provides the following layouts, which you can use by setting the `layout` [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) on each page, like so:\n\n```yaml\n---\nlayout: name\n---\n```\n\n### `layout: default`\n\nThis layout handles all of the basic page scaffolding placing the page content between the masthead and footer elements. All other layouts inherit this one and provide additional styling and features inside of the `{{ content }}` block.\n\n### `layout: post`\n\nThis layout accommodates the following front matter:\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| ---- | ----- | ---------- |\n| `image` | String | Path to a large image associated with the post. Also used for [OpenGraph](http://ogp.me/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards), and site feed thumbnail if enabled. [Suggested image sizes](#images). |\n| `image.path` | String | Same as above. Used when a `thumbnail` or `caption` needs to be assigned to the `image` object as well. |\n| `image.caption` | String | Describes the image or provides credit. Markdown is allowed. |\n| `author` | Object or string | Specify a post\'s author `name`, `picture`, `twitter`, `links`, etc. |\n| `comments` | Boolean | Disable comments with `comments: false`. |\n| `share` | Boolean | Add social share links to a post with `share: true`. |\n\n**Post image example:**\n\n```yaml\nimage:\n  path: /images/post-image-lg.jpg\n  thumbnail: /images/post-image-th.jpg\n  caption: "Photo credit [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)"\n```\n\n**Note:** `image.feature` front matter has been deprecated, to fully support [jekyll-seo-tag][jekyll-seo-tag]. If you are not using `thumbnail` or `caption` the post image can be assigned more concisely as `image: /images/your-post-image.jpg`.\n\n**Post author example:**\n\n```yaml\n# post specific author data if different from what is set in _config.yml\nauthor:\n  name: John Doe\n  picture: /images/john-doe.jpg\n  twitter: johndoe\n```\n\n**Note:** Author information can centralized in `_data/authors.yml` by doing following in the document\'s front matter:\n\n```yaml\nauthor: johndoe\n```\n\nWith the corresponding author key in `_data/authors.yml`:\n\n```yaml\njohndoe:\n  name: John Doe\n  picture: /images/john-doe.jpg\n  twitter: johndoe\n```\n\n**Note:** `author.picture` recommended size is `150 x 150` pixels.\n\n#### Author Links\n\nTo define what links appear in the author sidebar use the `authors.links` key in either `_config.yml` or `/_data/authors.yml`.\n\n| Name    | Description                                                                                                      |\n| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `title` | Describes the link. Not visible, used for accessibility purposes.                                                |\n| `url`   | URL the link points to.                                                                                          |\n| `icon`  | Corresponds with a [Font Awesome icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) e.g., `fab fa-twitter-square`.   |\n\n**Example:**\n\n```yaml\nauthor:\n  links:\n    - title: Twitter\n      url: https://twitter.com/username\n      icon: fab fa-twitter-square\n    - title: Instagram\n      url: https://instagram.com/username\n      icon: fab fa-instagram\n    - title: GitHub\n      url: https://github.com/username\n      icon: fab fa-github-square\n```\n\n**Note:** To disable author links completely use use:\n\n```yaml\nauthor:\n  links: false\n```\n\n### `layout: page`\n\nVisually this layout looks and acts similar `layout: post`, with the following\ndifferences.\n\n* Author sidebar and page meta (published date, categories, and tags) are ommitted.\n* Page is less wide due to omitted sidebar.\n* Disqus comments are omitted.\n* Next/Previous post navigation links omitted.\n\nThe page layout forms the base for several other layouts like [`home`](#layout-home), [`posts`](#layout-posts), [`categories`](#layout-categories), [`tags`](#layout-tags), [`collection`](#layout-collection), [`category`](#layout-category), [`tag`](#layout-tag), and [`search`](#layout-search).\n\n### `layout: home`\n\nThis layout accommodates the same front matter as `layout: page`, with the\naddition of the following:\n\n```yaml\npaginate: true  # enables pagination loop, see section above for additional setup\nentries_layout: # list (default), grid\n```\n\nWhen pagination is not enabled the page defaults to showing the latest 10 posts. To change the amount of posts shown, assign a limit value by adding the following to the page\'s front matter.\n\n```yaml\nposts_limit: 5\n```\n\nBy default, posts are shown in a list view. To change to a grid view add `entries_layout: grid` to the page\'s front matter.\n\n### `layout: posts`\n\nThis layout displays all posts grouped by the year they were published. It accommodates the same front matter as `layout: page`.\n\nBy default, posts are shown in a list view. To change to a grid view add `entries_layout: grid` to the page\'s front matter.\n\n### `layout: categories`\n\nThis layout displays all posts grouped category. It accommodates the same front matter as `layout: page`.\n\nBy default, posts are shown in a list view. To change to a grid view add `entries_layout: grid` to the page\'s front matter.\n\n### `layout: tags`\n\nThis layout displays all posts grouped by tag. It accommodates the same front matter as `layout: page`.\n\nBy default, posts are shown in a list view. To change to a grid view add `entries_layout: grid` to the page\'s front matter.\n\n### `layout: collection`\n\nThis layout displays all documents grouped by a specific collection. It accommodates the same front matter as `layout: page` with the addition of the following:\n\n```yaml\ncollection: # collection name\nentries_layout: # list (default), grid\nshow_excerpts: # true (default), false\nsort_by: # date (default) title\nsort_order: # forward (default), reverse\n```\n\nTo create a page showing all documents in the `recipes` collection you\'d create `recipes.md` in the root of your project and add this front matter:\n\n```yaml\ntitle: Recipes\nlayout: collection\npermalink: /recipes/\ncollection: recipes\n```\n\nBy default, documents are shown in a list view. To change to a grid view add `entries_layout: grid` to the page\'s front matter. If you want to sort the collection by title add `sort_by: title`. If you want reverse sorting, add `sort_order: reverse`. If you are simply looking for a list that shows recipe titles (no excerpts), add `show_excerpts: false`.\n\n### `layout: category`\n\nThis layout displays all posts grouped by a specific category. It accommodates the same front matter as `layout: page` with the addition of the following:\n\n```yaml\ntaxonomy: # category name\nentries_layout: # list (default), grid\n```\n\nBy default, posts are shown in a list view. To change to a grid view add `entries_layout: grid` to the page\'s front matter.\n\nTo create a page showing all posts assigned to the category `foo` you\'d create `foo.md` in the root of your project and add this front matter:\n\n```yaml\ntitle: Foo\nlayout: category\npermalink: /categories/foo/\ntaxonomy: foo\n```\n\n### `layout: tag`\n\nThis layout displays all posts grouped by a specific tag. It accommodates the same front matter as `layout: page` with the addition of the following:\n\n```yaml\ntaxonomy: # tag name\nentries_layout: # list (default), grid\n```\n\nBy default, posts are shown in a list view. To change to a grid view add `entries_layout: grid` to the page\'s front matter.\n\nTo create a page showing all posts assigned to the tag `foo bar` you\'d create `foo-bar.md` in the root of your project and add this front matter:\n\n```yaml\ntitle: Foo Bar\nlayout: tag\npermalink: /tags/foo-bar/\ntaxonomy: foo bar\n```\n\n### `layout: search`\n\nThis layout displays a search form and displays related pages based on the query.\n\nPage content index: `title`, `excerpt`, `content` (when enabled), `categories`, `tags`, and `url`.\n\nIf you would like to exclude specific pages/posts from the search index set the search flag to `false` in their front matter.\n\n```yaml\nsearch: false\n```\n\nTo index the full content of your documents set `search_full_content` to `true` in `_config.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nsearch_full_content: true\n```\n\n**Note:** Large amounts of posts will increase the size of the search index, impacting page load performance. Setting `search_full_content` to `false` (the default) restricts indexing to the first 50 words of body content.\n\n## Images\n\nSuggested image sizes in pixels are as follows:\n\n| Image | Description | Size |\n| ----- | ----------- | ---- |\n| `site.logo` | Site-wide logo used in masthead. | `200 x 200` |\n| `page.image.path` | Large full-width document image. | Tall images will push content down the page. `1600 x 600` is a good middle-ground size to aim for. |\n| `page.image` | Short-hand for `page.image.path` when used alone (without `thumbnail`, `caption`, or other variables). | Same as `page.image.path` |\n| `page.image.thumbnail` | Small document image used in grid view. | `400 x 200` |\n| `author.picture` | Author picture in post sidebar. | `150 x 150` |\n\n## Theme Text\n\nTo change text found throughout the theme, copy the following\n[`/_data/text.yml`](_data/text.yml) file and customize as necessary.\n\nWhen adding new texts be sure the keys match these [language/country codes](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee825488(v=cs.20).aspx>), that may be used for [`site.locale`](#site-locale).\n\n## Navigation\n\nTo define what pages are linked in the top navigation:\n\n1. Create a [`/_data/navigation.yml`](_data/navigation.yml) file.\n\n2. Add pages in the order you\'d like them to appear:\n\n   ```yaml\n   - title: Posts\n     url: /posts/\n   - title: Categories\n     url: /categories/\n   - title: External Page\n     url: https://whatever-site.com/page.html\n   - title: Search\n     url: /search/\n   ```\n\n**Note:** Long titles or many links may cause the navigation bar to break into multiple lines, especially on smaller screens. Keep this in mind as you develop your site\'s primary navigation.\n\n## Author\n\nAuthor information is used as meta data for post "by lines" and propagates the `creator` field of Twitter summary cards with the following front matter in `_config.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nauthor:\n  name: John Doe\n  twitter: johndoetwitter\n  picture: /images/johndoe.png\n```\n\nSite-wide author information can be overridden in a document\'s front matter in the same way:\n\n```yaml\nauthor:\n  name: Jane Doe\n  twitter: janedoetwitter\n  picture: /images/janedoe.png\n```\n\nOr by specifying a corresponding key in the document\'s front matter, that exists in `site.data.authors`. E.g., you have the following in the document\'s front matter:\n\n```yaml\nauthor: megaman\n```\n\nAnd you have the following in `_data/authors.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nmegaman:\n  name: Mega Man\n  twitter: megamantwitter\n  picture: /images/megaman.png\n\ndrlight:\n  name: Dr. Light\n  twitter: drlighttwitter\n  picture: /images/drlight.png\n```\n\nCurrently `author.picture` is only used in `layout: post`. Recommended size is `150 x 150` pixels.\n\n## Footer\n\nThe footer links and copyright text can both be customized.\n\n### Footer Links\n\nFooter links are set in `_config.yml` under the `footer_links` key.\n\n| Name    | Description                                                                                                      |\n| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `title` | Describes the link. Not visible, used for accessibility purposes.                                                |\n| `url`   | URL the link points to.                                                                                          |\n| `icon`  | Corresponds with a [Font Awesome 5 icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) e.g., `fab fa-twitter-square`. |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```yaml\nfooter_links:\n  - title: Twitter\n    url: https://twitter.com/username\n    icon: fab fa-twitter-square\n  - title: GitHub\n    url: https://github.com/mmistakes\n    icon: fab fa-github-square\n  - title: Feed\n    url: atom.xml\n    icon: fas fa-rss-square\n```\n\n**Note:** To disable footer links completely use `footer_links: false`.\n\n### Copyright Text\n\nBy default the copyright inserts the current year, [`site.title`](#site-title), and the words `"Powered by Jekyll & So Simple."` To change this add `copyright` to your `_config.yml` like so (Markdown is allowed):\n\n```yaml\ncopyright: "This site is made with <3 by *me, myself, and I*."\n```\n\n## Helpers\n\nYou can think of these Jekyll helpers as shortcodes. Since GitHub Pages doesn\'t allow most plugins --- [custom tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#tags) are out. Instead the theme leverages [**includes**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#includes) to do something similar.\n\n### Responsive Embed\n\nEmbed a video from YouTube/Vimeo or any other `iframe` content that responsively sizes to fit the width of its parent.\n\n| Parameter | Required | Description |\n| --------- | -------- | ----------- |\n| `url`     | Yes      | Video or iframe\'s URL e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PVofD2A9t8` |\n| `ratio`   | Optional | Ratio of the video or iframe content. `21:9`, `16:9`, `4:3`, `1:1`. If a ratio is not assigned `16:9` is used. |\n\n**Example:**\n\n```html\n{% include responsive-embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PVofD2A9t8" ratio="16:9" %}\n```\n\n### Table of Contents\n\nTo include an [auto-generated table of contents](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/converter/html.html#toc) for posts and pages, add the following helper where you\'d like it to appear.\n\n```html\n{% include toc %}\n```\n\n## Migration Guide\n\nSo Simple 3 is a major rewrite of the entire theme. The most notable changes are summarized below, followed by more specific changes.\n\nIt is safe to say you\'ll probably want to ditch all `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass`, `.css`, and `.js` files from v2 and use either the [Ruby gem](#ruby-gem-method) or [remote theme](github-pages-method) installation options.\n\n### Global Changes\n\n* "Fork method" has been deprecated in favor of installing/upgrading the theme via a gem or remote theme.\n* All `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass`, and JavaScript have been rebuilt.\n* Properly uses `site.url` and `site.baseurl` leveraging the `relative_url` and `absolute_url` filters.\n* Replaced custom `/_includes/open-graph.html` with [**jekyll-seo-tag**][jekyll-seo-tag].\n* Full control over links and icons used in author sidebar and footer.\n* Tag, articles, and blog starter pages have been replaced with new layouts ([`tags`](#layout-tags) and [`posts`](#layout-posts)) for easier use.\n* Removed `404.md` page.\n* Replaced custom `atom.xml` feed file with [**jekyll-feed**][jekyll-feed].\n* Removed default `favicon.ico` and `favicon.png` files.\n* Replaced simple JSON search with [**Lunr**](https://lunrjs.com/).\n* Replaced [Magnific Popup](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/) with [**Lity**](https://sorgalla.com/lity/).\n* Removed [FitVids.JS](http://fitvidsjs.com/).\n\n### Browser Support\n\n* CSS written with modern browsers in mind. Where possible fallbacks for `float` based layouts have been used so things don\'t look *too broken* in browsers that don\'t support `display: grid` and flexbox.\n\n### Configuration Changes\n\n#### Locale Changes\n\nFormat has changed from `en_US` (with an underscore) to `en-US` with a hyphen.\n\n#### Owner Changes\n\n`site.owner` is now `site.author` to better support [jekyll-seo-tag][jekyll-seo-tag] and [jekyll-feed][jekyll-feed].\n\n| v2                            | v3                                                             |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `site.owner.name`             | **`site.author.name`**                                         |\n| `site.owner.avatar`           | **`site.author.picture`**                                      |\n| `site.owner.email`            | **`site.author.email`**                                        |\n| `site.owner.twitter`          | **`site.twitter`**                                             |\n| `site.owner.google.analytics` | **deprecated**, replaced with [jekyll-seo-tag][jekyll-seo-tag] |\n| `site.owner.bing-verify`      | **deprecated**, replaced with [jekyll-seo-tag][jekyll-seo-tag] |\n\n#### Google Analytics Changes\n\n`site.owner.google.analytics` is now `site.google_analytics`. [See documentation](#google-analytics) for more information.\n\n#### Disqus Comments Changes\n\n`site.owner.disqus-shortname` is now `site.disqus.shortname`. [See documentation](#comments-via-disqus) more information.\n\nTo disable comments on a particular post add `comments: false` to its front matter.\n\n### Search Changes\n\n`search_omit` has been renamed to `search`. To exclude a post or page from search add `search: false` to its front matter instead.\n\n### Image Changes\n\nWhen assigning image paths for things like the `site.logo`, `page.image.path`, `author.picture`, etc. they now require a full relative or absolute path.\n\nIn So Simple v2 images were all placed in `/images/` and assigned in front matter with just the filename. For images to properly load, you now need to prepend all paths with `/images/`... if you are storing images there e.g., `/images/your-image.jpg`.\n\nTo better support Jekyll plugin\'s like [jekyll-seo-tag][jekyll-seo-tag], [jekyll-feed][jekyll-feed], and [jekyll-sitemap][jekyll-sitemap] most of the `image` keys have been renamed. Adjust the front matter in all of your posts\' and pages\' accordingly.\n\n| v2                 | v3                                         |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| `image.feature`    | **`image.path`**                           |\n| `image.thumb`      | **`image.thumbnail`**                      |\n| `image.credit`     | **`image.caption`** (Markdown allowed)     |\n| `image.creditlink` | deprecated use `**image.caption**` instead |\n\nA post with the following v2 front matter:\n\n```yaml\nimage:\n  feature: feature-image-filename.jpg\n  thumb: thumb-image-filename.jpg\n  credit: Michael Rose\n  creditlink: https://mademistakes.com\n```\n\nWould be converted into the following v3 front matter:\n\n```yaml\nimage:\n  path: /images/feature-image-filename.jpg\n  thumbnail: /images/thumb-image-filename.jpg\n  caption: "[Michael Rose](https://mademistakes)"\n```\n\n### Development Changes\n\n* Replaced Grunt tasks with [npm scripts](https://css-tricks.com/why-npm-scripts/).\n\n### Step-by-Step\n\nRough steps to migrate a stock So Simple v2 fork (with no alterations) to the latest.\n\n1. Remove `_includes/`, `_layouts/`, `_sass/`, `jshintrc`, `Gruntfile.js`, and `search.json`.\n2. Edit `Gemfile` for either the [Ruby gem](#ruby-gem-method) or [GitHub Pages](#github-pages-method) installation methods and follow those instructions.\n3. Add the following Google Fonts to `_config.yml`:\n\n   ```yaml\n   google_fonts:\n     - name: "Source Sans Pro"\n       weights: "400,400i,700,700i"\n     - name: "Lora"\n       weights: "400,400i,700,700i"\n   ```\n\n4. Edit `_config.yml` paying close attention to those keys that [have been renamed](#configuration-changes) or have new relative path requirements. `locale`, `logo`, and `owner` are good places to start.\n5. Rename all instances of `image.feature`, `image.thumb`, and `image.credit` in posts/pages adhering to the [image changes](#image-changes) above.\n6. Remove the body content in `index.html` and change `layout: page` to `layout: home`. Configure [pagination](#pagination) if necessary.\n7. Remove the body content in `/search/index.md` and change `layout: page` to **`layout: search`**.\n8. Remove the body content in `/tags/index.md` and change `layout: page` to **`layout: tags`**.\n9. Remove the body content in `/articles/index.md` and change `layout: page` to **`layout: category`** and add **`taxonomy: articles`**.\n10. Remove the body content in `/body/index.md` and change `layout: page` to **`layout: category`** and add **`taxonomy: blog`**.\n11. Rename `modified` front matter in posts/pages to **`last_modified_at`** for improved parity with plugins that support it.\n12. Add `tag_archive_path: "/tags/#"` to `_config.yml` to activate tag links in post meta sidebar.\n13. Rename `avatar` to **`picture`** in `_data/authors.yml` (and in any posts/pages front matter), and edit the paths adhering to the [image path changes](#image-changes) above.\n\n---\n\n## Customization\n\nWhen installing as a **Ruby gem** or **remote theme** the core theme files (`_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass`, `assets`, etc.) will be absent from your project.\n\nThe default structure, style, and scripts of this theme can be overridden and customized in the following two ways:\n\n### Overriding Includes and Layouts\n\nTheme files can be [overridden](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) by placing a file with the same name into your project\'s `_includes` or `_layouts` directory. For instance:\n\n* To add another social sharing button to [`_includes/social-share.html`](_includes/social-share.html), create an `_includes` directory in your project, copy `_includes/social-share.html` from So Simple\'s gem folder to `<your_project>/_includes` and edit that file.\n\n**ProTip:** to locate the theme\'s files on your computer run `bundle show jekyll-theme-so-simple`. This returns the location of the gem-based theme files.\n\nThe theme comes with two files to help inject custom markup and content into predefined locations.\n\n|     | Description |\n| --- | ----------- |\n| [`_includes/head-custom.html`](_includes/head-custom.html) | Inserted inside the `<head>` element for adding metadata, favicons, etc. |\n| [`_includes/footer-custom.html`](_includes/footer-custom.html) | Inserted inside the `<footer>` element before site scripts and copyright information. |\n\n### Customizing Sass (SCSS)\n\nTo override the default [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide) (located in theme\'s\n`_sass` directory), do one of the following:\n\n1. Copy directly from the So Simple gem\n\n   * Go to your local So Simple gem installation directory (run\n     `bundle show jekyll-theme-so-simple` to get the path to it).\n   * Copy the contents of `/assets/css/main.scss` from there to\n     `<your_project>`.\n   * Customize what you want inside `<your_project>/assets/css/main.scss`.\n\n2. Copy from this repo.\n\n   * Copy the contents of [assets/css/main.scss](assets/css/main.scss) to `<your_project>`.\n   * Customize what you want inside `<your_project/assets/css/main.scss`.\n\n**Note:** To customize the actual Sass partials bundled\nin the gem, you will need to copy the complete contents of the `_sass` directory to `<your_project>`. Due to the way Jekyll currently imports these files it\'s all or nothing. Overriding a single Sass partial (or two) won\'t work like `_includes` and `_layouts`.\n\nTo make basic tweaks to theme\'s style, Sass variables can be overridden by adding to `<your_project>/assets/css/main.scss`. For instance, to change the accent color used throughout the theme add the following before all `@import` lines:\n\n```scss\n$accent-color: tomato;\n```\n\n### Customizing JavaScript\n\nTo override the default JavaScript bundled in the theme, do one of the following:\n\n1. Copy directly from the So Simple gem\n\n   * Go to your local So Simple gem installation directory (run\n     `bundle show jekyll-theme-so-simple` to get the path to it).\n   * Copy the contents of `/assets/js/main.js` from there to\n     `<your_project>`.\n   * Customize what you want inside `<your_project>/assets/js/main.js`.\n\n2. Copy from this repo.\n\n   * Copy the contents of [`/assets/js/main.js`](assets/js/main.js)\n     to `<your_project>`.\n   * Customize what you want inside `<your_project>/assets/js/main.js`.\n\nThe theme\'s [`/assets/js/main.min.js`](assets/js/main.min.js) file is built from jQuery plugins and other scripts found in [`/assets/js/`](assets/js).\n\n```\n\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 assets\n|  \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 js\n|  |  \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 lunr                             # Lunr search plugin\n|  |  |   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 lunr.xx.js                   # Lunr language plugins\n|  |  |   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 ...\n|  |  |   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 lunr.min.js\n|  |  |   \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 lunr.stemmer.support.min.js\n|  |  \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 plugins\n|  |  |   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 jquery.smooth-scroll.min.js  # make same-page links scroll smoothly\n|  |  |   \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 lity.min.js                  # responsive lightbox\n|  |  |   \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 table-of-contents.js         # table of contents toggle\n|  |  \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 main.js                          # jQuery plugin settings and other scripts\n|  |  \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 main.min.js                      # concatenated and minified scripts\n|  |  \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 search-data.json                 # search index used by Lunr\n```\n\nTo modify or add your own scripts, include them in `assets/js/main.js` and then rebuild using `npm run build:js`. [See below for more details](#javascript-build-script).\n\nIf you add additional scripts to `/assets/js/plugins/` and would like them concatenated with the others, be sure to update the `uglify` script in [`package.json`](package.json). Same goes for scripts that you remove.\n\nYou can also add scripts to the `<head>` or closing `</body>` elements by adding paths to the following arrays in `_config.yml`.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```yaml\nhead_scripts:\n  - https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\n  - /assets/js/your-custom-head-script.js\nfooter_scripts:\n  - /assets/js/your-custom-footer-script.js\n```\n\n**Note:** If you assign paths to `footer_scripts` the theme\'s `/assets/js/main.min.js` file will be deactivated. This script includes plugins and other scripts that will cease to function unless you specifically add them to the `footer_scripts` array.\n\n## Font Awesome Icons\n\nThe theme utilizes the [**Font Awesome** SVG with JS](https://fontawesome.com/) version for iconography. Prominent locations these icons appear are in the author sidebar and footer links.\n\n---\n\n## Development\n\nTo set up your environment to develop this theme:\n\n1. Clone this repo\n2. `cd` into `/example` and run `bundle install`.\n\nTo test the theme locally as you make changes to it:\n\n1. `cd` into the root folder of the repo (e.g. `jekyll-theme-so-simple`).\n2. Run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser to\n   `http://localhost:4000/example/`.\n\nThis starts a Jekyll server using the theme\'s files and contents of the `example/` directory. As modifications are made, refresh your browser to see any changes.\n\n### JavaScript Build Script\n\nIn an effort to reduce dependencies a set of [npm scripts](https://css-tricks.com/why-npm-scripts/) are used to build `main.min.js` instead of task runners like [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) or [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). If those tools are more your style then by all means use them instead :wink:.\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. Install Node.js.\n2. `cd` to the root of your project.\n3. Install all of the dependencies by running npm install.\n\n**Note:** If you upgraded from a previous version of the theme be sure you copied over [`package.json`](package.json) prior to running `npm install`. You may also need to remove your `node_modules` directory as well.\n\nIf all goes well, executing `npm run build:js` will compress/concatenate `main.js` and all plugin scripts into `/assets/js/main.min.js`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nFound a typo in the documentation?
