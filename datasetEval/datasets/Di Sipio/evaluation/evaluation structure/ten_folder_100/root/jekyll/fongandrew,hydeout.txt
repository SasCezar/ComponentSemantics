b'# Hydeout\n\nHydeout updates the original [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)\ntheme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) 3.x and adds new functionality.\n\n![Desktop](/_screenshots/1.png?raw=true)\n<img alt="Mobile home page" src="/_screenshots/2.png?raw=true" width="300px" />\n<img alt="Mobile post page" src="/_screenshots/3.png?raw=true" width="300px" />\n\n### Usage\n\nHydeout is available as the `jekyll-theme-hydeout` Ruby Gem.\nAdd `gem "jekyll-theme-hydeout", "~> 3.4"` to your Gemfile and run\n`bundle install`.\n\nIf you\'re installing on Github pages, you may also have to add\n`remote_theme: fongandrew/hydeout` to your `_config.yml`. [See the Github\ninstructions for more details.](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site/)\n\nHydeout uses pagination, so if you have an `index.md`, you\'ll need to swap\nit with an `index.html` that uses the `index` layout:\n\n```\n---\nlayout: index\ntitle: Home\n---\n```\n\nYou\'ll also need to add a setting to `_config.yml` telling Jekyll how many posts\nto include per page (e.g. `paginate: 5`).\n\n### Keep It Simple\n\nIn keeping with the original Hyde theme, Hydeout aims to keep the overall\ndesign lightweight and plugin-free. JavaScript is currently limited only\nto Disqus and Google Analytics (and is only loaded if you provide configuration\nvariables).\n\nHydeout makes heavy use of Flexbox in its CSS. If Flexbox is not available,\nthe CSS degrades into a single column layout.\n\n### Customization\n\nHydeout replaces Hyde\'s class-based theming with the use\nof the following SASS variables:\n\n```scss\n$sidebar-bg-color: #202020 !default;\n$sidebar-fg-color: white !default;\n$sidebar-sticky: true !default;\n$layout-reverse: false !default;\n$link-color: #268bd2 !default;\n```\n\nTo override these variables, create your own `assets/css/main.scss` file.\nDefine your own variables, then import in Hydeout\'s SCSS, like so:\n\n```scss\n---\n# Jekyll needs front matter for SCSS files\n---\n\n$sidebar-bg-color: #ac4142;\n$link-color: #ac4142;\n$sidebar-sticky: false;\n@import "hydeout";\n```\n\nSee the [_variables](_sass/hydeout/_variables.scss) file for other variables\nyou can override.\n\nYou can see the full set of partials you can replace in the\n[`_includes`](_includes) folder, but there are a few worth noting:\n\n* `_includes/copyright.html` - Insert your own copyright here.\n\n* `_includes/custom-head.html` - Insert custom head tags (e.g. to load your\n  own stylesheets)\n\n* `_includes/custom-foot.html` - Insert custom elements at the end of the\n  body (e.g. for custom JS)\n\n* `_includes/custom-nav-links.html` - Additional nav links to insert at the\n  end of the list of links in the sidebar.\n\n  Pro-tip: The `nav`s in the sidebar are flexboxes. Use the `order` property\n  to order your links.\n\n* `_includes/custom-icon-links.html`- Additional icon links to insert at the\n  end of the icon links at the bottom of the sidebar. You can use the `order`\n  property to re-order.\n\n* `_includes/favicons.html` - Replace references to `favicon.ico` and\n  `favicon.png` with your own favicons references.\n\n* `_includes/font-includes.html` - The Abril Fatface font used for the site\n  title is loaded here. If you\'re overriding that font in the CSS, be sure\n  to also remove the font load reference here.\n\n### New Features\n\n* Hydeout adds a new tags page (accessible in the sidebar). Just create a\n  new page with the tags layout:\n\n  ```\n  ---\n  layout: tags\n  title: Tags\n  ---\n  ```\n\n* Hydeout adds a new "category" layout for dedicated category pages.\n  Category pages are automatically added to the sidebar. All other pages\n  must have `sidebar_link: true` in their front matter to show up in\n  the sidebar. To create a category page, use the `category` layout"\n\n  ```\n  ---\n  layout: category\n  title: My Category\n  ---\n\n  Description of "My Category"\n  ```\n\n* You can control how pages are sorted by using the `sidebar_sort_order`\n  parameter in the front matter. This works for both category and non-category\n  pages, although non-category pages will always come first. Take a look at\n  [`_includes/sidebar-nav-links.html`](./_includes/sidebar-nav-links.html) if\n  you want to customize this behavior.\n\n  ```\n  ---\n  layout: page\n  title: My page\n  sidebar_sort_order: 123\n  ---\n\n  Some content.\n  ```\n\n* A simple redirect-to-Google search is available. Just create a page with\n  the `search` layout.\n\n  ```\n  ---\n  layout: search\n  title: Google Search\n  ---\n  ```\n\n* Disqus integration is ready out of the box. Just add the following to\n  your config file:\n\n  ```yaml\n  disqus:\n    shortname: my-disqus-shortname\n  ```\n\n  If you don\'t want Disqus or want to use something else, override\n  `comments.html`.\n\n* For Google Analytics support, define a `google_analytics` variable with\n  your property ID in your config file.\n\nThere\'s also a bunch of minor tweaks and adjustments throughout the\ntheme. Hope this works for you!\n'
