It is faster and has more functionality than builtin Transmission web interface.\n\nTransmission Remote GUI is developed using Lazarus RAD and Free Pascal compiler.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Native application for Windows, Linux and macOS\n- uTorrent-like interface\n- Select files to download\n- Choose files priority\n- View details about connected peers\n- Full information about each torrent\n- Per torrent options\n\n## Installation\n\nThe installers are listed on the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/transmission-remote-gui/transgui/releases/latest) page, and the installation instructions for different platform are listed as below :arrow_down:\n\n### Linux\n\n#### Easy way (recommended)\n\nThere are precompiled program\'s binaries for i386 and x86_64 Linux architectures.\n\n- Download and extract the release for your architecture.\n\nNow you can execute the `transgui` binary. *(Change the `transgui` file permissions to executable if needed)*\n\nAdditionally, you can create a desktop or menu shortcut to the transgui executable, and run the program using the created shortcut.\n\n#### Harder way\n\nBuild the program by yourself.\n\n1. Make sure you have working Lazarus and Free Pascal compiler installed.\n  - Free Pascal Compiler 2.6.2+ and Lazarus 1.6 is used to develop Transmission Remote GUI.\n2. Download the sources archive and extract it to some folder or perform svn checkout.\n3. Open terminal/command line prompt and cd to the sources folder.\n4. Execute `make` command to build the application.\n5. Execute `make zipdist` command to create a release .zip archive in the `Release` sub-folder.\n\n### Windows\n\n#### Portable zip tarball (recommended)\n\n- Zip tarball release is much more small than the installer one, which can save you some bandwidth, disk space and time, just simply download and extract the zip tarball to wherever you want, directly execute `transgui.exe` or add shortcut for it.\n\n**Note**: The first time you use this program, you may need to install some additional dependencies (if you need SSL/TLS enabled), including [Visual C++ Redistributable Package](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40784)([Direct link](http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/5/6/056dcda9-d667-4e27-8001-8a0c6971d6b1/vcredist_x86.exe)) and [OpenSSL libs](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries)([Direct link](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)), this only needs to be done once.\n\n#### Installer\n\nThis installer has additional installation wizard and includes static OpenSSL libraries in every releases, the size would be much bigger than the zip tarball, but you don\'t need to take care of the OpenSSL dependencies.\n\n1. Directly download the installer.\n2. Run the installer and follow the steps to install it on your system.\n\n#### Using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)\n\nRun `cinst transgui` to install the latest version of Transmission Remote GUI.\n\n### macOS\n\n#### Without a package manager\n\nThis method needs no additional pre-requirement or dependency, just:\n\n1. Download the app image from release page.\n2. Open the image file to mount the image.\n3. Directly run the application or drag the app icon to your disk / Application folder.\n\n#### Homebrew-Cask\n\nYou need to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, and [Homebrew-Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) enabled, with Homebrew, you can enable Homebrew-Cask by a single command, skip this step if you already got it:\n\n- `brew tap caskroom/cask`\n\nWith Homebrew-Cask, directly execute this command to install Transmission Remote Gui:\n\n- `brew cask install transmission-remote-gui`\n\n## Command line parameters\n\nYou can specify path to a .torrent file or a magnet link as a command line parameter. The program will add the specified torrent.\n\n- `-hidden` : Start the program hidden. Only the program\'s tray icon will be visible.\n- `--home=<home_dir>` : Specifies a home directory for the program. All program\'s settings are stored in the home directory. You can run multiple instances of the program by specifying different home directories.\n\n## Portable mode\n\nIf the program finds the transgui.ini file in the same folder as the binary file, then it will store all configuration and data files in the program\'s folder, instead of the folder in a user profile.\n\n## Fixed hotkeys\n\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> : All Torrents\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> : Downloading\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> : Completed\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> : Active\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd> : Inactive\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>6</kbd> : Stopped\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>7</kbd> : Error\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>8</kbd> : Waiting\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> : Searchbox (filter torrents by keywords) - Esc cancel filter and clean the box.\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> : Info Pane - General Tab\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> : Info Pane - Trackers Tab\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> : Info Pane - Peers Tab\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> : Info Pane - Files Tab\n\n## Advanced parameters\n\nThere are some parameters in the `transgui.ini file`, that can not be modified via the GUI.\nMore info on: [#924](https://github.com/transmission-remote-gui/transgui/issues/924) (File Manager & Shortcuts) , [#1020](https://github.com/transmission-remote-gui/transgui/issues/1020) (User Defined Menu *Windows Only*) and [#1070](https://github.com/transmission-remote-gui/transgui/issues/1070) (.torrent Auto Opening)\n\n```ini\n[Interface]\n; Maximum number of elements in the folder history list\nMaxFoldersHistory=10\n\n[Interface]\n;In Linux/MacOs Only if "Open Container Folder" give you error\nFileOpenDoc=0\n\n[Interface]\n;Alternate File Manager (Windows Only)\nFileManagerDefault={Full path to your File Manager .exe}\nFileManagerDefaultParam={Alternate parameters, could be left blank}\n\n[Interface]\n;System Wide Shortcut key (Windows Only)\nGlobalHotkey={Virtual Key Code} full list here http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Seattle/en/Virtual_Key_Codes (Plus VK_A...VK_Z and VK_0..VK_9)\nGlobalHotkeyMod={Modifier Key} [MOD_SHIFT , MOD_CONTROL , MOD_ALT , MOD_WIN alone or combined with + sign]\n\n[Interface]\nWatchLocalFolder= {LOCAL Folder to watch for torrent files}\nWatchDestinationFolder= {REMOTE destination where the data would be saved if missing or empty last destination folder is used}\nWatchInterval=1 {Time period in MINUTES between folder scans for torrents, may be fractional values 0,50 = 30 seconds}\n\n[Shortcuts]\n;Modify all the shortcuts of the GUI here\n\n[Usermenu]\nCaption1={Caption in the menu}\nExeName1={Full path to the program .exe you want to add to menu}\nParams1="%s" {Usually "%s" but some programs may require additional parameters}\nCaption2={same for item 2}\nExeName2={same for item 2}\nParams2={same for item 2}\n\n[StatusBarPanels]\n;Customize the width of the statusbar panels to fit your language\n;0 is the left most panel and 7 is the right most panel.\n0=327\n1=152\n2=152\n3=130\n4=130\n5=130\n6=130\n7=130\n\n[MainForm]\nBigToolBarHeight=48 {Height of the Big Icon Toolbar if missing default is 64}\n\n[MainForm]\nFromNow=1 {1=Shows the dates relatives to now , 0=Absolute Dates MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS}\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2019 by Yury Sidorov and Transmission Remote GUI working group.\n\nTransmission Remote GUI is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nTransmission Remote GUI is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
