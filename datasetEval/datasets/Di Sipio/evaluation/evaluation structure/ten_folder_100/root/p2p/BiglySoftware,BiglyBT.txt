BiglyBT is forked from Vuze/Azureus and is being maintained by two of the original developers as well as members of the community.  With over 15 years of development, there\'s a good chance we have the features you are looking for, as well as the decade old bugs you aren\'t looking for :)\n\n* [Official BiglyBT site](https://www.biglybt.com)\n* [Ways to Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* [Translation Information](TRANSLATE.md)\n* [Feature Voting Page](https://vote.biglybt.com)\n* [Coding Guidelines](CODING_GUIDELINES.md)\n\n## Donations\n\n\n| Method | Address |\n|:--|:--|\n| PayPal | [BiglyBT\'s Donation Page](https://www.biglybt.com/donation/donate.php) |\n| BCH/BTC/BSG/BSV | 1BiGLYBT38ttJhvZkjGc5mCw5uKoRHcUmr |\n| DASH            | XjDwmSrDPQBaLzCkuRHZaFzHf7mTVxkW9K |\n| DOGE | DMXWdEtPUJc5p2sbHGo77SvqFXKTR8Vff1 |\n| ETH/ETC | 0x4e609B5EF88C8aA8Ab73945fD1ba68c9E27faC75 |\n| LTC | LKGc2utCrGfojpYsX3naT9n1AxjLiZ5MMG |\n| TRX/BTT | TAbsb7pjEEWNpXFvPf49rfVhFSB2e3dAM7 |\n| XRP | rPFKfbx2tuzMMaz7Zy99M6CquHKgp9srSb |\n\n## Setting up Dev Environment\n\nGetting the basics to compile from source is pretty straightforward:\n\n1. Clone the repo into your favorite IDE\n1. Mark `core/src` and `uis/src` as project roots (source modules)\n1. To the uis module, add `core/lib/*` and one of the swt.jars at `/uis/lib/`:<br>\n  `swt-win64.jar` on Windows<br>\n  `swt-cocoa-64.jar` on OSX<br>\n  `swt-linux-64.jar` on Linux (GTK)\n1. To the core module, add `core/lib/*`\n1. Make `uis` module depend on `core`.  `Core` should not depend on `uis`\n\nIntelliJ IDEA will do all these steps for you with its wizard.\n\n### External Annotations\n\nIf you wish IntelliJ IDEA to show MessageBundle strings instead of keys, as well as reduce the number of NPE warnings, you can attach the external annotations either by:\n* Project Settings->Modules->Paths->External Annotations\n*  in `<module>/<module>.iml` add to component:\n    ```\n    <annotation-paths>\n      <root url="file://$MODULE_DIR$/../external-annotations" />\n    </annotation-paths>\n    ```\nExternal Annotations definitions are a WIP and not complete list of definitions.\n\n## Running in Dev Environment\n\nRunning is only few more steps:\n\n* Main class is `com.biglybt.ui.Main` in module `uis`\n* Working Directory should be a new folder, since the app will write things to it. Put the `aereg.dll` or `libOSXAccess.jnilib` in there.\n  \n  When a normal user is running the app, the working directory is where the jar, executable, and libraries (dll, so, jnilib) are.\n* If you want a separate config dir from the default one, use VM Option `-Dazureus.config.path=<some config path>`\n* Run it\n\n## Release Installer Notes\n\nWe build our installers using [Install4j, multi-platform installer builder](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html)\n\n![Install4j Logo](https://www.ej-technologies.com/images/product_banners/install4j_large.png)\n'
