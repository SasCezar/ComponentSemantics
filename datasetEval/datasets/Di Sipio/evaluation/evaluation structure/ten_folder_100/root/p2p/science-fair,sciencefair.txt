But we\'re just getting started. Check out the [roadmap](#roadmap) to see where we\'re headed.**\n\n---\n\n## Why ScienceFair?\n\nHow we access, read and reuse scientific literature is largely controlled\nby a few vast publishing organisations. Many wonderful innovations are being\nexplored outside those organisations, but they are rarely\nintegrated into the platforms where people actually access science.\n\n**We have a vision of a different, better, future for science.** A future that\'s more **fair, inclusive and open.**\nA future where **people can explore and innovate** and where **users control and customise their experience**.\n\n**ScienceFair aims to help pave the road to that future.** The main thing that sets it apart? **Freedom from centralised control.**\n\n---\n\nWe\'re creating a desktop experience for discovering, tracking, collecting and reading scientific articles that:\n\n- is completely free from external control (e.g. by publishers or platforms)\n- helps decentralise the distribution and storage of the scholarly literature\n- allows the user to customise their experience\n- promotes and integrates open data and metadata\n- helps grow an ecosystem of open source tools around scientific literature\n\n## contents\n\n- [downloads](#downloads)\n- [technical details](#technical-details)\n- [screenshots](#screenshots)\n\t- [home screen](#home-screen)\n\t- [search results](#search-results)\n\t- [selection & stats](#selection--stats)\n\t- [reader](#reader)\n- [development](#development)\n- [roadmap](#roadmap)\n\n## downloads\n\nYou can download installers or bundled apps for Windows, Mac and Linux from the [releases page](https://github.com/codeforscience/sciencefair/releases).\n\nIf you find a bug, please [report it in the issue tracker](https://github.com/codeforscience/sciencefair/issues).\n\n## technical details\n\nSome of the things that ScienceFair does differently:\n\n### A reading experience optimised for Science\n\nWe use the beautiful [Lens reader](https://github.com/elifesciences/lens) to render JATS XML to a reading experience optimised for scientific papers.\n\n<img src="https://github.com/codeforscience/sciencefair/raw/master/assets/screenshots/reader.png" alt="reader" />\n\n### Instant multi-source search\n\nInstant search of your local collection **and** remote datasources, only downloading the data requested.\n\n<img src="https://github.com/codeforscience/sciencefair/raw/master/assets/screenshots/results.png" alt="results" />\n\n### Secure, flexible, distributed datasources\n\nA ScienceFair datasource can be a journal, a curated community collection, a personal reading list... anything you like.\n\nv1.0 comes with the eLife journal by default, and more will follow very soon.\n\nDatasources are append-only feeds of JATS XML articles, signed with public-key encryption and distributed peer-to-peer (using [dat](https://datproject.org/)). This means:\n\n- downloads come from the nearest, fastest sources\n- it doesn\'t matter if the original source goes offline\n- only the original creator can add new content\n- anyone can create a datasource (tools to make this easy [coming soon](#roadmap))\n- your local collection of articles is ready for data mining\n\nAnd importantly, **datasources you create are private** unless you decide to share them, and **nobody can ever take a datasource offline**.\n\n### Built-in bibliometrics and analytics\n\nBasic bibliometrics are built-in in `v1.0`.\n\nFull analysis and data-mining tools, alt-metrics and enriched annotation will be [coming soon](#roadmap).\n\n<img src="https://github.com/codeforscience/sciencefair/raw/master/assets/screenshots/selection.png" alt="selection" />\n\nScienceFair also follows a few simple design principles that we feel are missing from the ecosystem:\n\n- we keep the interface minimal and clear\n- incremental discovery is the way\n- be beautiful\n\n<img src="https://github.com/codeforscience/sciencefair/raw/master/assets/screenshots/home.png" alt="home screen" />\n\n## development\n\nThis project uses node `v8`, ideally the [latest version](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v7.x/). It also uses the two-`package.json` structure ([what??](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Two-package.json-Structure)).\n\nTo get a local copy working, clone this repo, then run\n\n- `npm install` to install dev dependencies\n- `cd app && npm install` to install regular dependencies\n- `cd .. && npm run dev` to start in development mode\n\n## roadmap\n\n- [x] `v1.0` **proof of concept**:\n  - incorporate major new technologies (dat/hyperdrive, lens reader, instant search)\n  - core user experience and design\n  - development, packaging and distribution architecture in place\n  - `1.0.x` releases will be bug fixes and non-breaking improvements\n- [ ] `v1.1` **focus on datasources**:\n  - more, and bigger, datasources available by default\n  - tools for creating and managing datasources\n  - interface for creating and securely sharing p2p collections within the app\n  - a platform and interface for discovering and managing datasources\n- [ ] `v1.2` **focus on enrichment**:\n  - altmetrics, updates (e.g. retractions), etc. displayed in context in realtime\n  - advanced bibliometrics and data-mining tools\n  - annotation and commenting, within the app and drawn from existing sources\n- [ ] `v2.0` **focus on user customisation**:\n  - a package system, allowing customising and extending key aspects of the experience\n  - tools and documentation for making new packages\n  - a platform and interface for discovering and managing packages\n'
