You can install\nthem using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run\n\n```shell\nmake geth\n```\n\nor, to build the full suite of utilities:\n\n```shell\nmake all\n```\n\n## Executables\n\nThe go-ethereum project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`\ndirectory.\n\n|    Command    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| :-----------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|  **`geth`**   | Our main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Command-Line-Options) for command line options.          |\n|   `abigen`    | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Native-DApps:-Go-bindings-to-Ethereum-contracts) wiki page for details. |\n|  `bootnode`   | Stripped down version of our Ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|     `evm`     | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| `gethrpctest` | Developer utility tool to support our [ethereum/rpc-test](https://github.com/ethereum/rpc-tests) test suite which validates baseline conformity to the [Ethereum JSON RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) specs.

For this\nparticular use-case the user doesn\'t care about years-old historical data, so we can\nfast-sync quickly to the current state of the network. To do so:\n\n```shell\n$ geth console\n```\n\nThis command will:\n * Start `geth` in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag),\n   causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history\n   of the Ethereum network, which is very CPU intensive.\n * Start up `geth`\'s built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/JavaScript-Console),\n   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can invoke all official [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)\n   as well as `geth`\'s own [management APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs).\n   This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running\n   `geth` instance with `geth attach`.\n\n### A Full node on the Ethereum test network\n\nTransitioning towards developers, if you\'d like to play around with creating Ethereum\ncontracts, you almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until\nyou get the hang of the entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main\nnetwork, you want to join the **test** network with your node, which is fully equivalent to\nthe main network, but with play-Ether only.\n\n```shell\n$ geth --testnet console\n```\n\nThe `console` subcommand has the exact same meaning as above and they are equally\nuseful on the testnet too. Please see above for their explanations if you\'ve skipped here.\n\nSpecifying the `--testnet` flag, however, will reconfigure your `geth` instance a bit:\n\n * Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.ethereum` on Linux for example), `geth`\n   will nest itself one level deeper into a `testnet` subfolder (`~/.ethereum/testnet` on\n   Linux). Note, on OSX and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node\n   requires the use of a custom endpoint since `geth attach` will try to attach to a\n   production node endpoint by default. E.g.\n   `geth attach <datadir>/testnet/geth.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by\n   this.\n * Instead of connecting the main Ethereum network, the client will connect to the test\n   network, which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis states.\n\n*Note: Although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from\ncrossing over between the main network and test network, you should make sure to always\nuse separate accounts for play-money and real-money. Unless you manually move\naccounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any\naccounts available between them.*\n\n### Full node on the Rinkeby test network\n\nThe above test network is a cross-client one based on the ethash proof-of-work consensus\nalgorithm. As such, it has certain extra overhead and is more susceptible to reorganization\nattacks due to the network\'s low difficulty/security. Go Ethereum also supports connecting\nto a proof-of-authority based test network called [*Rinkeby*](https://www.rinkeby.io)\n(operated by members of the community). This network is lighter, more secure, but is only\nsupported by go-ethereum.\n\n```shell\n$ geth --rinkeby console\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nAs an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a\nconfiguration file via:\n\n```shell\n$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml\n```\n\nTo get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to\nexport your existing configuration:\n\n```shell\n$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig\n```\n\n*Note: This works only with `geth` v1.6.0 and above.*\n\n#### Docker quick start\n\nOne of the quickest ways to get Ethereum up and running on your machine is by using\nDocker:\n\n```shell\ndocker run -d --name ethereum-node -v /Users/alice/ethereum:/root \\\n           -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 \\\n           ethereum/client-go\n```\n\nThis will start `geth` in fast-sync mode with a DB memory allowance of 1GB just as the\nabove command does.  It will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for\nsaving your blockchain as well as map the default ports. There is also an `alpine` tag\navailable for a slim version of the image.\n\nDo not forget `--rpcaddr 0.0.0.0`, if you want to access RPC from other containers\nand/or hosts. By default, `geth` binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints is not\naccessible from the outside.\n\n### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes\n\nAs a developer, sooner rather than later you\'ll want to start interacting with `geth` and the\nEthereum network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid\nthis, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC)\nand [`geth` specific APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs)).\nThese can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based\nplatforms, and named pipes on Windows).\n\nThe IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,\nwhereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a\nsubset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as\nyou\'d expect.\n\nHTTP based JSON-RPC API options:\n\n  * `--rpc` Enable the HTTP-RPC server\n  * `--rpcaddr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)\n  * `--rpcport` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)\n  * `--rpcapi` API\'s offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)\n  * `--rpccorsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)\n  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server\n  * `--wsaddr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)\n  * `--wsport` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)\n  * `--wsapi` API\'s offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)\n  * `--wsorigins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests\n  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server\n  * `--ipcapi` API\'s offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3`)\n  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)\n\nYou\'ll need to use your own programming environments\' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to\nconnect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you\'ll\nneed to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You\ncan reuse the same connection for multiple requests!\n\n**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based\ntransport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert\nEthereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally\nrunning web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available\nAPIs!**\n\n### Operating a private network\n\nMaintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for\ngranted in the official networks need to be manually set up.\n\n#### Defining the private genesis state\n\nFirst, you\'ll need to create the genesis state of your networks, which all nodes need to be\naware of and agree upon. This consists of a small JSON file (e.g. call it `genesis.json`):\n\n```json\n{\n  "config": {\n    "chainId": <arbitrary positive integer>,\n    "homesteadBlock": 0,\n    "eip150Block": 0,\n    "eip155Block": 0,\n    "eip158Block": 0,\n    "byzantiumBlock": 0,\n    "constantinopleBlock": 0,\n    "petersburgBlock": 0\n  },\n  "alloc": {},\n  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",\n  "difficulty": "0x20000",\n  "extraData": "",\n  "gasLimit": "0x2fefd8",\n  "nonce": "0x0000000000000042",\n  "mixhash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",\n  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",\n  "timestamp": "0x00"\n}\n```\n\nThe above fields should be fine for most purposes, although we\'d recommend changing\nthe `nonce` to some random value so you prevent unknown remote nodes from being able\nto connect to you. If you\'d like to pre-fund some accounts for easier testing, create\nthe accounts and populate the `alloc` field with their addresses.\n\n```json\n"alloc": {\n  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001": {\n    "balance": "111111111"\n  },\n  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002": {\n    "balance": "222222222"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith the genesis state defined in the above JSON file, you\'ll need to initialize **every**\n`geth` node with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly\nset:\n\n```shell\n$ geth init path/to/genesis.json\n```\n\n#### Creating the rendezvous point\n\nWith all nodes that you want to run initialized to the desired genesis state, you\'ll need to\nstart a bootstrap node that others can use to find each other in your network and/or over\nthe internet. The clean way is to configure and run a dedicated bootnode:\n\n```shell\n$ bootnode --genkey=boot.key\n$ bootnode --nodekey=boot.key\n```\n\nWith the bootnode online, it will display an [`enode` URL](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/enode-url-format)\nthat other nodes can use to connect to it and exchange peer information. Make sure to\nreplace the displayed IP address information (most probably `[::]`) with your externally\naccessible IP to get the actual `enode` URL.\n\n*Note: You could also use a full-fledged `geth` node as a bootnode, but it\'s the less\nrecommended way.*\n\n#### Starting up your member nodes\n\nWith the bootnode operational and externally reachable (you can try\n`telnet <ip> <port>` to ensure it\'s indeed reachable), start every subsequent `geth`\nnode pointed to the bootnode for peer discovery via the `--bootnodes` flag. It will\nprobably also be desirable to keep the data directory of your private network separated, so\ndo also specify a custom `--datadir` flag.\n\n```shell\n$ geth --datadir=path/to/custom/data/folder --bootnodes=<bootnode-enode-url-from-above>\n```\n\n*Note: Since your network will be completely cut off from the main and test networks, you\'ll\nalso need to configure a miner to process transactions and create new blocks for you.*\n\n#### Running a private miner\n\nMining on the public Ethereum network is a complex task as it\'s only feasible using GPUs,\nrequiring an OpenCL or CUDA enabled `ethminer` instance. For information on such a\nsetup, please consult the [EtherMining subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/)\nand the [Genoil miner](https://github.com/Genoil/cpp-ethereum) repository.\n\nIn a private network setting, however a single CPU miner instance is more than enough for\npractical purposes as it can produce a stable stream of blocks at the correct intervals\nwithout needing heavy resources (consider running on a single thread, no need for multiple\nones either). To start a `geth` instance for mining, run it with all your usual flags, extended\nby:\n\n```shell\n$ geth <usual-flags> --mine --miner.threads=1 --etherbase=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n```\n\nWhich will start mining blocks and transactions on a single CPU thread, crediting all\nproceedings to the account specified by `--etherbase`. You can further tune the mining\nby changing the default gas limit blocks converge to (`--targetgaslimit`) and the price\ntransactions are accepted at (`--gasprice`).\n\n## Contribution\n\nThank you for considering to help out with the source code!
