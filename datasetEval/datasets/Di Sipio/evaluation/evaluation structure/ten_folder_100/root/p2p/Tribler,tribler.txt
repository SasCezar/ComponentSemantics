b'*******\nTribler\n*******\n\n|jenkins_build| |docs| |contributors| |pr_closed| |issues_closed| |downloads_7_0| |downloads_7_1| |downloads_7_2| |doi| |openhub|\n\n*Towards making Bittorrent anonymous and impossible to shut down.*\n\nDevelopers usually hang out in the official IRC channel #tribler @ FreeNode (click `here <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=tribler>`__ for direct a webchat window)\n\nWe use our own dedicated Tor-like network for anonymous torrent downloading. We implemented and enhanced the *Tor protocol specifications* plus merged them with Bittorrent streaming. More info: https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki\nTribler includes our own Tor-like onion routing network with hidden services based seeding and end-to-end encryption, detailed specs: https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki/Anonymous-Downloading-and-Streaming-specifications\n\nThe aim of Tribler is giving anonymous access to online (streaming) videos. We are trying to make privacy, strong cryptography and authentication the Internet norm.\n\nTribler currently offers a Youtube-style service. For instance, Bittorrent-compatible streaming, fast search, thumbnail previews and comments. For the past 11 years we have been building a very robust Peer-to-Peer system. Today Tribler is robust: "the only way to take Tribler down is to take The Internet down" (but a single software bug could end everything).\n\n**We make use of submodules, so remember using the --recursive argument when cloning this repo.**\n\n\nObtaining the latest release\n============================\n\nJust click `here <https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/releases/latest>`__ and download the latest package for your OS.\n\nObtaining support\n=================\n\nIf you found a bug or have a feature request, please make sure you read `our contributing page <http://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/devel/contributing.html>`_ and then `open an issue <https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/issues/new>`_. We will have a look at it ASAP.\n\nContributing\n============\n\nContributions are very welcome!\nIf you are interested in contributing code or otherwise, please have a look at `our contributing page <http://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/devel/contributing.html>`_.\nHave a look at the `issue tracker <https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/issues>`_ if you are looking for inspiration :).\n\nSetting up your development environment\n=======================================\n\nWe support development on Linux, macOS and Windows. We have written documentation that guides you through installing the required packages when setting up a Tribler development environment. See `our Linux development guide <http://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/devel/development/development_on_linux.html>`_ for the guide on setting up a development environment on Linux distributions. See `our Windows development guide <http://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/devel/development/development_on_windows.html>`_ for setting everything up on Windows. See `our OS X development guide <http://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/devel/development/development_on_osx.html>`_ for the guide to setup the development environment on macOS.\n\nRunning Tribler from the repository\n===================================\n\nFirst clone the repository:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    git clone --recursive git@github.com:Tribler/tribler.git\n\nor, if you haven\'t added your ssh key to your github account:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Tribler/tribler.git\n\nSecond, install the `dependencies <doc/development/development_on_linux.rst>`_.\n\nDone!\nNow you can run tribler by executing the ``tribler.sh`` script on the root of the repository:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    ./tribler.sh\n    \nOn Windows, you can use the following command to run Tribler:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    python run_tribler.py\n    \nPackaging Tribler\n=================\n\nWe have written guides on how to package Tribler for distribution on various systems. Please take a look `here <http://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/devel/building/building.html>`_.\n\nSubmodule notes\n===============\n\n- As updated submodules are in detached head state, remember to check out a branch before committing changes on them.\n- If you forgot to check out a branch before doing a commit, you should get a warning telling you about it. To get the commit to a branch just check out the branch and do a git cherry-pick of the commit.\n- Take care of not accidentally committing a submodule revision change with ``git commit -a``.\n- Do not commit a submodule update without running all the tests first and making sure the new code is not breaking Tribler.\n\n.. |jenkins_build| image:: http://jenkins-ci.tribler.org/job/Test_tribler_devel/badge/icon\n    :target: http://jenkins-ci.tribler.org/job/Test_tribler_devel/\n    :alt: Build status on Jenkins\n\n.. |pr_closed| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr-closed/tribler/tribler.svg?style=flat\n    :target: https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/pulls\n    :alt: Pull Requests\n    \n.. |issues_closed| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/tribler/tribler.svg?style=flat\n    :target: https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/issues\n    :alt: Issues\n    \n.. |openhub| image:: https://www.openhub.net/p/tribler/widgets/project_thin_badge.gif?style=flat\n    :target: https://www.openhub.net/p/tribler\n\n.. |downloads_7_0| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/tribler/tribler/v7.0.2/total.svg?style=flat\n    :target: https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/releases\n    :alt: Downloads(7.0.2)\n\n.. |downloads_7_1| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/tribler/tribler/v7.1.3/total.svg?style=flat\n    :target: https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/releases\n    :alt: Downloads(7.1.3)\n    \n.. |downloads_7_2| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/tribler/tribler/v7.2.2/total.svg?style=flat\n    :target: https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/releases\n    :alt: Downloads(7.2.2)\n\n.. |contributors| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/tribler/tribler.svg?style=flat\n    :target: https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/graphs/contributors\n    :alt: Contributors\n    \n.. |doi| image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/8411137.svg\n    :target: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/8411137\n    :alt: DOI number\n\n.. |docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/tribler/badge/?version=devel\n    :target: https://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/devel/?badge=devel\n    :alt: Documentation Status\n'
