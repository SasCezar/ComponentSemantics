b"# ZeroNet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet.svg?branch=py3)](https://travis-ci.org/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-faq-brightgreen.svg)](https://zeronet.io/docs/faq/) [![Help](https://img.shields.io/badge/keep_this_project_alive-donate-yellow.svg)](https://zeronet.io/docs/help_zeronet/donate/)\n\nDecentralized websites using Bitcoin crypto and the BitTorrent network - https://zeronet.io\n\n\n## Why?\n\n* We believe in open, free, and uncensored network and communication.\n* No single point of failure: Site remains online so long as at least 1 peer is\n  serving it.\n* No hosting costs: Sites are served by visitors.\n* Impossible to shut down: It's nowhere because it's everywhere.\n* Fast and works offline: You can access the site even if Internet is\n  unavailable.\n\n\n## Features\n * Real-time updated sites\n * Namecoin .bit domains support\n * Easy to setup: unpack & run\n * Clone websites in one click\n * Password-less [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)\n   based authorization: Your account is protected by the same cryptography as your Bitcoin wallet\n * Built-in SQL server with P2P data synchronization: Allows easier site development and faster page load times\n * Anonymity: Full Tor network support with .onion hidden services instead of IPv4 addresses\n * TLS encrypted connections\n * Automatic uPnP port opening\n * Plugin for multiuser (openproxy) support\n * Works with any browser/OS\n\n\n## How does it work?\n\n* After starting `zeronet.py` you will be able to visit zeronet sites using\n  `http://127.0.0.1:43110/{zeronet_address}` (eg.\n  `http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D`).\n* When you visit a new zeronet site, it tries to find peers using the BitTorrent\n  network so it can download the site files (html, css, js...) from them.\n* Each visited site is also served by you.\n* Every site contains a `content.json` file which holds all other files in a sha512 hash\n  and a signature generated using the site's private key.\n* If the site owner (who has the private key for the site address) modifies the\n  site, then he/she signs the new `content.json` and publishes it to the peers.\n  Afterwards, the peers verify the `content.json` integrity (using the\n  signature), they download the modified files and publish the new content to\n  other peers.\n\n####  [Slideshow about ZeroNet cryptography, site updates, multi-user sites \xc2\xbb](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_2qK1IuOKJ51pgBvllZ9Yu7Au2l551t3XBgyTSvilew/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)\n####  [Frequently asked questions \xc2\xbb](https://zeronet.io/docs/faq/)\n\n####  [ZeroNet Developer Documentation \xc2\xbb](https://zeronet.io/docs/site_development/getting_started/)\n\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/H60OAHY.png)\n![ZeroTalk](https://zeronet.io/docs/img/zerotalk.png)\n\n#### [More screenshots in ZeroNet docs \xc2\xbb](https://zeronet.io/docs/using_zeronet/sample_sites/)\n\n\n## How to join\n\n### Windows\n\n - Download [ZeroNet-py3-win64.zip](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-win/archive/dist-win64/ZeroNet-py3-win64.zip) (18MB)\n - Unpack anywhere\n - Run `ZeroNet.exe`\n \n### macOS\n\n - Download [ZeroNet-dist-mac.zip](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-dist/archive/mac/ZeroNet-dist-mac.zip) (13.2MB)\n - Unpack anywhere\n - Run `ZeroNet.app`\n \n### Linux (x86-64bit)\n - `wget https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-linux/archive/dist-linux64/ZeroNet-py3-linux64.tar.gz`\n - `tar xvpfz ZeroNet-py3-linux64.tar.gz`\n - `cd ZeroNet-linux-dist-linux64/`\n - Start with: `./ZeroNet.sh`\n - Open the ZeroHello landing page in your browser by navigating to: http://127.0.0.1:43110/\n \n __Tip:__ Start with `./ZeroNet.sh --ui_ip '*' --ui_restrict your.ip.address` to allow remote connections on the web interface.\n\n### Install from source\n\n - `wget https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/archive/py3/ZeroNet-py3.tar.gz`\n - `tar xvpfz ZeroNet-py3.tar.gz`\n - `cd ZeroNet-py3`\n - `sudo apt-get update`\n - `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`\n - `sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`\n - Start with: `python3 zeronet.py`\n - Open the ZeroHello landing page in your browser by navigating to: http://127.0.0.1:43110/\n\n## Current limitations\n\n* ~~No torrent-like file splitting for big file support~~ (big file support added)\n* ~~No more anonymous than Bittorrent~~ (built-in full Tor support added)\n* File transactions are not compressed ~~or encrypted yet~~ (TLS encryption added)\n* No private sites\n\n\n## How can I create a ZeroNet site?\n\nShut down zeronet if you are running it already\n\n```bash\n$ zeronet.py siteCreate\n...\n- Site private key: 23DKQpzxhbVBrAtvLEc2uvk7DZweh4qL3fn3jpM3LgHDczMK2TtYUq\n- Site address: 13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2\n...\n- Site created!\n$ zeronet.py\n...\n```\n\nCongratulations, you're finished!
