b"Bitcoin Core integration/staging tree\n=====================================\n\nhttps://bitcoincore.org\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n----------------\n\nBitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to\nanyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate\nwith no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried\nout collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source\nsoftware which enables the use of this currency.\n\nFor more information, as well as an immediately usable, binary version of\nthe Bitcoin Core software, see https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/, or read the\n[original whitepaper](https://bitcoincore.org/bitcoin.pdf).\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nBitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more\ninformation or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.\n\nDevelopment Process\n-------------------\n\nThe `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be\ncompletely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created\nregularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.\n\nThe contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\nand useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTesting and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull\nrequests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing\nother people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people\nlots of money.\n\n### Automated Testing\n\nDevelopers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to\nsubmit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run\n(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running\nand extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).\n\nThere are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written\nin Python, that are run automatically on the build server.\nThese tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`\n\nThe Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.\n\n### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing\n\nChanges should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the\ncode. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful\nto add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is\nnot straightforward.\n\nTranslations\n------------\n\nChanges to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to\n[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/).\n\nTranslations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the\n[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.\n\n**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next\npull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.\n\nTranslators should also subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-translators).\n"
