The forming peer network can be layed over other CDNs or on top of the origin server. Powered by [hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js), it can play HLS on any platform with many\xc2\xa0popular HTML5 players such\xc2\xa0as video.js, JWPlayer and Flowplayer. BTW, you can view how much traffic has been saved [here](https://oms.cdnbye.com)!\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- WebRTC data channels for lightweight peer-to-peer communication with no plugins\r\n- Support live and VOD streams over HLS protocol(m3u8)\r\n- Support encrypted HLS stream\r\n- Very easy to  integrate with an existing hls.js project\r\n- Seamlessly fallback to normal server usage if a browser doesn\'t support WebRTC\r\n- Highly configurable for users\r\n- Support most popular HTML5 players such as video.js\xe3\x80\x81Clappr\xe3\x80\x81Flowplayer\r\n- Efficient scheduling policies to enhance the performance of P2P streaming\r\n- Use IP database to group up peers by ISP and regions\r\n- API frozen, new releases will not break your code\r\n\r\n## Playground\r\n[Click me!](https://demo.cdnbye.com/)\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n#### Quick Start Demo\r\nPut the [quick-start.html](demo/quick-start.html) in your web page, run it. Wait for a few seconds\xef\xbc\x8cthen open the same page from another browser. Now you have a direct P2P connection between two browsers without plugin!\r\nThe first web peer will serve as a seed, if no one else in the same channel.\r\n#### Integrate to Your Hls.js Project\r\nSimply replace the hls.js script tag like:\r\n ```javascript\r\n<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@latest"></script>\r\n```\r\nwith \r\n ```javascript\r\n<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cdnbye@latest"></script>\r\n```\r\nThat\'s it!\r\n#### Integrate to HTML5 Players\r\nSee [demos](https://github.com/cdnbye/hlsjs-p2p-engine#player-integration).\r\n\r\n## Browser Support\r\nWebRTC has already been incorporated into the HTML5 standard and it is broadly deployed in modern browsers. The compatibility of CDNBye depends on the browser support of WebRTC and Hls.js. Please note that iOS Safari "Mobile" does not support the MediaSource API.\r\n\r\n Compatibility|Chrome | Firefox | macOS Safari| Android Wechat/QQ | Opera | Edge | IE | iOS Safari | \r\n:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:| :-:| :-:\r\nWebRTC Datachannel | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9d\x8c | \xe2\x9c\x94 |\r\nHls.js | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9d\x8c |\r\nCDNBye | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9c\x94 | \xe2\x9d\x8c | \xe2\x9d\x8c |\r\n\r\n## Include\r\nInclude the pre-built script of latest version bundled with hls.js(recommended): \r\n```javascript\r\n<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cdnbye@latest"></script>\r\n```\r\nOr include the latest version without hls.js:\r\n```javascript\r\n<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cdnbye@latest/dist/hlsjs-p2p-engine.min.js"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nSee [Usage](http://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/usage?id=usage)\r\n\r\n## Player Integration\r\n- [videojs](http://videojs.com/)\r\n    - See [videojs demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=videojs)\r\n- [flowplayer](https://flowplayer.com/)\r\n    - See [flowplayer demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=flowplayer)\r\n- [jwplayer](https://www.jwplayer.com/)\r\n    - See [jwplayer demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=jwplayer)\r\n- [DPlayer](https://github.com/MoePlayer/DPlayer)\r\n    - See [dplayer demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=dplayer)\r\n- [CKPlayer](http://www.ckplayer.com/)\r\n    - See [ckplayer demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=ckplayer) based on [P2P-CKPlayer](https://github.com/cdnbye/P2P-CKPlayer)\r\n- [clappr](https://github.com/clappr/clappr)\r\n    - See [clappr demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=clappr)\r\n- [MediaElement.js](http://www.mediaelementjs.com/)\r\n    - See [mediaelement demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=mediaelementjs)\r\n- [TCPlayer](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/881/20207)(Tencent Cloud Player)\r\n    - See [tcplayer demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=tcplayer)\r\n- [Chimee](http://chimee.org/)\r\n    - See [chimee demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=chimee)\r\n- [XGPlayer](http://h5player.bytedance.com/en/)\r\n    - See [xgplayer demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=xgplayer)\r\n- [fluidplayer](https://www.fluidplayer.com/)\r\n    - See [fluidplayer demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=fluidplayer)\r\n- [OpenPlayer](https://www.openplayerjs.com/)\r\n    - See [OpenPlayer demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=openplayer)\r\n- [Plyr](https://plyr.io/)\r\n    - See [Plyr demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=plyr)\r\n- [Playerjs](https://playerjs.com/)\r\n    - See [Playerjs demo](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/players?id=playerjs)\r\n- `Add your customized player here`\r\n    - CDNBye can be integrated into any HTML5 video player that with hls.js built in.\r\n\r\n\r\n## API and Configuration\r\nSee [API.md](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/web/API)\r\n\r\n## Console\r\nBind your domain in `https://oms.cdnbye.com`, where you can view p2p-related information.\r\n\r\n## Related Projects\r\n- [android-p2p-engine](https://github.com/cdnbye/android-p2p-engine) - Live/VOD P2P Engine for Android and Android TV.\r\n- [ios-p2p-engine](https://github.com/cdnbye/ios-p2p-engine) - iOS Video P2P Engine for Any Player.\r\n- [flutter-p2p-engine](https://github.com/cdnbye/flutter-p2p-engine) - Live/VOD P2P Engine for Flutter, contributed by [mjl0602](https://github.com/mjl0602).\r\n\r\n## They are using CDNBye\r\n[<img src="https://timgsa.baidu.com/timg?image&quality=80&size=b9999_10000&sec=1531253035445&di=7af6cc9ad4abe3d06ba376af22d85131&imgtype=0&src=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.kuai8.com%2Fattaches%2Fintro%2F1213%2F201612131436417407.png" width="120">](https://egame.qq.com/?hls=1&p2p=1&_debug=1)\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\nWe have collected some [frequently asked questions](https://docs.cdnbye.com/#/en/FAQ).
