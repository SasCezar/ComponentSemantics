b"[Fire\xe2\x98\x85](http://www.firestr.com) (Fire Star) 0.11.1\n===================================================================\n\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/fire/badge/?version=latest)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/fire/?badge=latest)\n[![firestr](https://snapcraft.io/firestr/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/firestr)\n\n**The Grass Computing Platform**\n\nFire\xe2\x98\x85 is a platform for creating and sharing P2P software.\nThis is not cloud software, but grass software.\nYou can touch it and shape it.\n\nFire\xe2\x98\x85 provides a built in application editor where you can program in \nreal time with others. Apps are written in the Lua programming language\nusing an API designed for writing P2P applications. \n\nSharing an application with another is as simple as using it in a conversation. \nThey can install it on their system with one click and use it in their own conversations.\nAny program you get you can open in the application editor to modify and share.\n\nThe hard part of setting up a P2P connection (NAT transversal, UDP hole punching, etc)\nis done for you so you can concentrate on building applications that work together\nwithout a central server. \n\nAll communication is encrypted between peers to provide a safe environment and \nno communication is routed through a server.\n\nWARNING\n===================================================================\n\nThe software is in development. The security of the software has\nnot been audited so use AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n\nIf you are a security expert, please contribute.\n\nThe encryption used is RSA with 4k keys for handshaking and AES where \nDiffie-Hellman is used to create an ephemeral key for a connection session.\n\nOrganization\n===================================================================\n\nFire\xe2\x98\x85 is written using C++11 and requires a fairly modern compiler.\nIt should work with the latest gcc, clang, and visual studio. \n\nThe main directory is src. Each subdirectory is a library and\nthe main application is in src/firestr\n\nThe project uses CMake as the meta-build configuration.\n\nBuild Dependencies\n===================================================================\n\n* gcc 6.3+\n* CMake\n* Qt 5 \n* Boost 1.54+\n* Botan 1.10+\n* libopus\n* libsnappy\n* uuid\n* libssl\n* libgmp\n\nBuilding Using Vagrant\n===================================================================\n\nInstall vagrant on your machine. Open a terminal and run:\n\n    $ vagrant up\n    $ vagrant ssh\n    $ startxfce4&\n\nIf asked, password is 'vagrant'.\n\nOpen terminal in the VM and run:\n\n    $ cd /vagrant\n    $ mkdir build\n    $ cd build\n    $ cmake ..\n    $ make -j2\n\nYou can then run two test instances:\n\n    $ cd src/firestr/\n    $ ./firestr --home test1 &\n    $ ./firestr --home test2 &\n\n\nLicense GPLv3\n===================================================================\n\nCopyright (C) 2017  Maxim Noah Khailo\n \nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n \nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
