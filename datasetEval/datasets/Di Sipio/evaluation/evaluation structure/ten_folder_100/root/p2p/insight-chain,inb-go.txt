For this\nparticular use-case the user doesn\'t care about years-old historical data, so we can\nfast-sync quickly to the current state of the network. To do so:\n\n```shell\n$ ginb console\n```\n\n### Full supernode on the main INB network\n\nIf you want to be a supernode and have the right to mine, you have to get someone else\'s vote in advance and only the 21 nodes with the highest number of votes have the chance.\n\nIf you meet the above conditions, please continue.\n\nYou need to make your nodeid before you start the network.\n```shell\n$ ginb nodekey [datadir]\n```\nThe returned nodeid (as enodes.id) needs to be configured in the genesis.json file, as well as your ip, port, name, country and so on.\nData provide some other K-V information if you want to store\n\n```json\n{\n  "config": {\n    "chainId": 891,\n    "homesteadBlock": 0,\n    "eip155Block": 0,\n    "eip158Block": 0,\n    "byzantiumBlock": 0,\n    "vdpos": {\n      "period": 3,\n      "signerPeriod": 3,\n      "signerBlocks": 6,\n      "epoch": 201600,\n      "maxSignersCount": 21, \n      "minVoterBalance": 1000000000000000000,\n      "genesisTimestamp": 1561544470,\n      "signers": [\n        "0x891b2388ce73356917b21ca54f3039cbdfc29313",\n        "0x4643ce2d6d4fe02e2b57070806364dde9eb8cac9",\n        "0x230cf5081833c4f16e69e102ea00a4583a33cb11"\n      ],\n  "enodes":[\n            {"address":"0x891b2388ce73356917b21ca54f3039cbdfc29313",\n            "id":"327d1a41974ad0a672d9b3dcfada5a934b4c21207e95a40d534bde44c2f7b39c4f10dda7a7bc060c00868a77b522878ab960dff2f23f463616736a1e6e39ea93",\n            "ip":"192.168.1.181",\n            "port":"30001",\n            "name":"inb",\n            "nation":"China",\n            "city":"beijing",\n            "image":"www.image.com",\n            "website":"www.insightchain.io",\n            "email":"insightchain@xx.com",\n            "data":"{\\"hobby\\":\\"money\\",\\"age\\":\\"21\\"}"},\n\n            {"address":"0x891b2388ce73356917b21ca54f3039cbdfc29313",\n            "id":"327d1a41974ad0a672d9b3dcfada5a934b4c21207e95a40d534bde44c2f7b39c4f10dda7a7bc060c00868a77b522878ab960dff2f23f463616736a1e6e39ea93",\n            "ip":"192.168.1.181",\n            "port":"30001",\n            "name":"inb",\n            "nation":"China",\n            "city":"beijing",\n            "image":"www.image.com",\n            "website":"www.insightchain.io",\n            "email":"insightchain@xx.com",\n            "data":"{\\"hobby\\":\\"money\\",\\"age\\":\\"21\\"}"},\n\n            {"address":"0x891b2388ce73356917b21ca54f3039cbdfc29313",\n            "id":"327d1a41974ad0a672d9b3dcfada5a934b4c21207e95a40d534bde44c2f7b39c4f10dda7a7bc060c00868a77b522878ab960dff2f23f463616736a1e6e39ea93",\n            "ip":"192.168.1.181",\n            "port":"30001",\n            "name":"inb",\n            "nation":"China",\n            "city":"beijing",\n            "image":"www.image.com",\n            "website":"www.insightchain.io",\n            "email":"insightchain@xx.com",\n            "data":"{\\"hobby\\":\\"money\\",\\"age\\":\\"21\\"}"},\n]\n}\n  },\n  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",\n  "difficulty": "0x1",\n  "extraData": "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",\n  "gasLimit": "0x2fefd8",\n  "nonce": "0x0",\n  "mixHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",\n  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",\n  "timestamp": "0x00",\n  "alloc": {\n    "891b2388ce73356917b21ca54f3039cbdfc29313": {\n      "balance": "0"\n    },\n    "4643ce2d6d4fe02e2b57070806364dde9eb8cac9": {\n      "balance": "0"\n    },\n    "230cf5081833c4f16e69e102ea00a4583a33cb11": {\n      "balance": "0"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nVdpos is necessary. Period represents the number of seconds between blocks, signerPeriod represents the number of seconds blocks between two super nodes, signerBlocks represents the number of packaged blocks per super node, epoch represents the interval between emptying voting information and re-voting, and maxSignersCount represents the maximum number of super nodes.\nEnodes represents information about all super nodes that were first voted for and everyone automatically connects to the supernodes\' networks.\n\nTip:Then everyone initializes the Genesis Block with the same set of genesis.json files\n```shell\n$ ginb init path/to/genesis.json\n```\nFinally start the network\n```shell\n$ ginb --datadir data1/ --networkid 891 --nodiscover --rpcport 6002 --port 30002 console\n```\n\n###  Full node on the INB test network\n\nTransitioning towards developers, if you\'d like to play around with creating INB\ncontracts, you almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until\nyou get the hang of the entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main\nnetwork, you want to join the **test** network with your node, which is fully equivalent to\nthe main network, but with play-inber only.\n\n```shell\n$ ginb --testnet console\n```\n\nThe `console` subcommand has the exact same meaning as above and they are equally\nuseful on the testnet too. Please see above for their explanations if you\'ve skipped here.\n\nSpecifying the `--testnet` flag, however, will reconfigure your `ginb` instance a bit:\n\n * Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.inb` on Linux for example), `ginb`\n   will nest itself one level deeper into a `testnet` subfolder (`~/.inb/testnet` on\n   Linux). Note, on OSX and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node\n   requires the use of a custom endpoint since `ginb attach` will try to attach to a\n   production node endpoint by default. E.g.\n   `ginb attach <datadir>/testnet/ginb.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by\n   this.\n * Instead of connecting the main INB network, the client will connect to the test\n   network, which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis states.\n   \n*Note: Although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from\ncrossing over between the main network and test network, you should make sure to always\nuse separate accounts for play-money and real-money. Unless you manually move\naccounts, `ginb` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any\naccounts available between them.*\n\n\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nAs an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `ginb` binary, you can also pass a\nconfiguration file via:\n\n```shell\n$ geinb --config /path/to/your_config.toml\n```\n\nTo get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to\nexport your existing configuration:\n\n```shell\n$ ginb --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig\n```\n\n\n\n### Programmatically interfacing `ginb` nodes\n\nAs a developer, sooner rather than later you\'ll want to start interacting with `ginb` and the\nInsight network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid\nthis, `ginb` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs \nand [`ginb` specific APIs]\nThese can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based\nplatforms, and named pipes on Windows).\n\nThe IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `ginb`,\nwhereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a\nsubset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as\nyou\'d expect.\n\nHTTP based JSON-RPC API options:\n\n  * `--rpc` Enable the HTTP-RPC server\n  * `--rpcaddr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)\n  * `--rpcport` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)\n  * `--rpcapi` API\'s offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `inb,net,web3`)\n  * `--rpccorsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)\n  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server\n  * `--wsaddr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)\n  * `--wsport` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)\n  * `--wsapi` API\'s offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `inb,net,web3`)\n  * `--wsorigins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests\n  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server\n  * `--ipcapi` API\'s offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,inb.vdpos,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3`)\n  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)\n\nYou\'ll need to use your own programming environments\' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to\nconnect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `ginb` node configured with the above flags and you\'ll\nneed to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You\ncan reuse the same connection for multiple requests!\n\n**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based\ntransport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert\nInsight nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally\nrunning web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available\nAPIs!**\n\n### Operating a private network\n\nMaintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for\ngranted in the official networks need to be manually set up.\n\n#### Defining the private genesis state\n\nFirst, you\'ll need to create the genesis state of your networks, which all nodes need to be\naware of and agree upon. This consists of a small JSON file (e.g. call it `genesis.json`):\n\n```json\n{\n  "config": {\n    "chainId": 891,\n    "homesteadBlock": 0,\n    "eip155Block": 0,\n    "eip158Block": 0,\n    "byzantiumBlock": 0,\n    "vdpos": {\n      "period": 3,\n      "signerPeriod": 3,\n      "signerBlocks": 6,\n      "epoch": 201600,\n      "maxSignersCount": 21, \n      "minVoterBalance": 1000000000000000000,\n      "genesisTimestamp": 1561544470,\n      "signers": [\n        "0x891b2388ce73356917b21ca54f3039cbdfc29313",\n        "0x4643ce2d6d4fe02e2b57070806364dde9eb8cac9",\n        "0x230cf5081833c4f16e69e102ea00a4583a33cb11"\n      ],\n  "enodes":[\n            {"address":"0x891b2388ce73356917b21ca54f3039cbdfc29313",\n            "id":"327d1a41974ad0a672d9b3dcfada5a934b4c21207e95a40d534bde44c2f7b39c4f10dda7a7bc060c00868a77b522878ab960dff2f23f463616736a1e6e39ea93",\n            "ip":"192.168.1.181",\n            "port":"30001",\n            "name":"inb",\n            "nation":"China",\n            "city":"beijing",\n            "image":"www.image.com",\n            "website":"www.insightchain.io",\n            "email":"insightchain@xx.com",\n            "data":"{\\"hobby\\":\\"money\\",\\"age\\":\\"21\\"}"},\n\n            {"address":"0x891b2388ce73356917b21ca54f3039cbdfc29313",\n            "id":"327d1a41974ad0a672d9b3dcfada5a934b4c21207e95a40d534bde44c2f7b39c4f10dda7a7bc060c00868a77b522878ab960dff2f23f463616736a1e6e39ea93",\n            "ip":"192.168.1.181",\n            "port":"30001",\n            "name":"inb",\n            "nation":"China",\n            "city":"beijing",\n            "image":"www.image.com",\n            "website":"www.insightchain.io",\n            "email":"insightchain@xx.com",\n            "data":"{\\"hobby\\":\\"money\\",\\"age\\":\\"21\\"}"},\n\n            {"address":"0x891b2388ce73356917b21ca54f3039cbdfc29313",\n            "id":"327d1a41974ad0a672d9b3dcfada5a934b4c21207e95a40d534bde44c2f7b39c4f10dda7a7bc060c00868a77b522878ab960dff2f23f463616736a1e6e39ea93",\n            "ip":"192.168.1.181",\n            "port":"30001",\n            "name":"inb",\n            "nation":"China",\n            "city":"beijing",\n            "image":"www.image.com",\n            "website":"www.insightchain.io",\n            "email":"insightchain@xx.com",\n            "data":"{\\"hobby\\":\\"money\\",\\"age\\":\\"21\\"}"},\n]\n}\n```\n\nThe above fields should be fine for most purposes, although we\'d recommend changing\nthe `nonce` to some random value so you prevent unknown remote nodes from being able\nto connect to you. If you\'d like to pre-fund some accounts for easier testing, you can\npopulate the `alloc` field with account configs:\n\n```json\n"alloc": {\n  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001": {\n    "balance": "111111111"\n  },\n  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002": {\n    "balance": "222222222"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith the genesis state defined in the above JSON file, you\'ll need to initialize **every**\n`ginb` node with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly\nset:\n\n```shell\n$ ginb init path/to/genesis.json\n```\n\n#### Creating the rendezvous point\n\nWith all nodes that you want to run initialized to the desired genesis state, you\'ll need to\nstart a bootstrap node that others can use to find each other in your network and/or over\nthe internet. The clean way is to configure and run a dedicated bootnode:\n\n```shell\n$ bootnode --genkey=boot.key\n$ bootnode --nodekey=boot.key\n```\n\n\n*Note: You could also use a full-fledged `ginb` node as a bootnode, but it\'s the less\nrecommended way.*\n\n#### Starting up your member nodes\n\nWith the bootnode operational and externally reachable (you can try\n`telnet <ip> <port>` to ensure it\'s indeed reachable), start every subsequent `ginb`\nnode pointed to the bootnode for peer discovery via the `--bootnodes` flag. It will\nprobably also be desirable to keep the data directory of your private network separated, so\ndo also specify a custom `--datadir` flag.\n\n```shell\n$ ginb --datadir=path/to/custom/data/folder --bootnodes=<bootnode-enode-url-from-above>\n```\n\n*Note: Since your network will be completely cut off from the main and test networks, you\'ll\nalso need to configure a miner to process transactions and create new blocks for you.*\n\n#### Running a private miner\n\nMining on the public Insight network is a complex task as it\'s only feasible using GPUs,\nrequiring an OpenCL or CUDA enabled `inbminer` instance. For information on such a\nsetup\n\nIn a private network setting, however a single CPU miner instance is more than enough for\npractical purposes as it can produce a stable stream of blocks at the correct intervals\nwithout needing heavy resources (consider running on a single thread, no need for multiple\nones either). To start a `ginb` instance for mining, run it with all your usual flags, extended\nby:\n\n```shell\n$ ginb <usual-flags> --mine --minerthreads=1 --inberbase=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n```\n\n\n\n\n'
