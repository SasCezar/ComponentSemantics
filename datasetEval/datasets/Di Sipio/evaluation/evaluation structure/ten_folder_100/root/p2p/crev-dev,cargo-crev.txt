This tool helps Rust users evaluate the quality and trustworthiness of their package dependencies.\n\n## Features\n\n`cargo-crev` can already:\n\n* warn you about untrustworthy crates and security vulnerabilities,\n* display useful metrics about your dependencies,\n* help you identify dependency-bloat,\n* allow you to review most suspicious dependencies and publish your findings,\n* use reviews produced by other users,\n* increase trustworthiness of your own code,\n* build a web of trust of other reputable users to help verify the code you use,\n\nand many other things with many more to come.\n\n## Getting started\n\nStatic binaries are available from the [releases page](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev/releases).\n\nFollow the [`cargo-crev` - Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev/blob/master/cargo-crev/src/doc/getting_started.md)\n(more documentation available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/cargo-crev)).\n\n`cargo-crev` is a work in progress, but it should be usable at all times.\nJoin our [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!uBhYhtcoNlyEbzfYAW:matrix.org) or [gitter](https://gitter.im/crev-dev/cargo-crev) channel, get help,\nreport problems and feedback. Thank you!\n\n## Raise awareness\n\nIf you\'re supportive of the cause, we would appreciate helping to raise awareness of the project. Consider putting the below note in the README of your Rust projects:\n\n```\nIt is recommended to always use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)\nto verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies, including this one.\n```\n\nThank you!\n\n## Changelog\n\nChangelog can be found here: https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev/blob/master/cargo-crev/CHANGELOG.md\n'
