It synchronizes\nfiles between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.\nThe goals are listed in order of importance, the most important one being\nthe first. This is the summary version of the goal list - for more\ncommentary, see the full [Goals document][13].\n\nSyncthing should be:\n\n1. **Safe From Data Loss**\n\n   Protecting the user's data is paramount. We take every reasonable\n   precaution to avoid corrupting the user's files.\n\n2. **Secure Against Attackers**\n\n   Again, protecting the user's data is paramount. Regardless of our other\n   goals we must never allow the user's data to be susceptible to\n   eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.\n\n3. **Easy to Use**\n\n   Syncthing should be approachable, understandable and inclusive.\n\n4. **Automatic**\n\n   User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.\n\n5. **Universally Available**\n\n   Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the\n   latest technology is not always available to any given individual.\n\n6. **For Individuals**\n\n   Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,\n   secure and easy to use file synchronization.\n\n7. **Everything Else**\n\n   There are many things we care about that don't make it on to the list. It\n   is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict\n   with the stated goals above.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTake a look at the [getting started guide][2].\n\nThere are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background\non your system in [the etc directory][3]. There are also several [GUI\nimplementations][11] for Windows, Mac and Linux.\n\n## Docker\n\nTo run Syncthing in Docker, see [the Docker README][16].\n\n## Vote on features/bugs\n\nWe'd like to encourage you to [vote][12] on issues that matter to you.\nThis helps the team understand what are the biggest pain points for our users, and could potentially influence what is being worked on next.\n\n## Getting in Touch\n\nThe first and best point of contact is the [Forum][8]. There is also an IRC\nchannel, `#syncthing` on [freenode][4] (with a [web client][9]), for talking\ndirectly to developers and users. If you've found something that is clearly a\nbug, feel free to report it in the [GitHub issue tracker][10].\n\n## Building\n\nBuilding Syncthing from source is easy, and there's a [guide][5]\nthat describes it for both Unix and Windows systems.\n\n## Signed Releases\n\nAs of v0.10.15 and onwards release binaries are GPG signed with the key\nD26E6ED000654A3E, available from https://syncthing.net/security.html and\nmost key servers.\n\nThere is also a built in automatic upgrade mechanism (disabled in some\ndistribution channels) which uses a compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS\nbinaries are also properly code signed.\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease see the [Syncthing documentation site][6].\n\nAll code is licensed under the [MPLv2 License][7].\n\n[1]: https://docs.syncthing.net/specs/bep-v1.html\n[2]: https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html\n[3]: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/etc\n[4]: https://www.freenode.net/\n[5]: https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/building.html\n[6]: https://docs.syncthing.net/\n[7]: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/LICENSE\n[8]: https://forum.syncthing.net/\n[9]: https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/#syncthing\n[10]: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues\n[11]: https://docs.syncthing.net/users/contrib.html#gui-wrappers\n[12]: https://www.bountysource.com/teams/syncthing/issues\n[13]: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/GOALS.md\n[14]: assets/logo-text-128.png\n[15]: https://syncthing.net/\n[16]: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/README-Docker.md\n\n"
