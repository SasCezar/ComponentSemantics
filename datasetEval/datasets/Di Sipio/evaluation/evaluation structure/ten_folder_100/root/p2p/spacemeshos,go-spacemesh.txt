This repo is the go implementation of the [Spacemesh](https://spacemesh.io) p2p full node software.\n\nSpacemesh is a decentralized blockchain computer using a new race-free consensus protocol that doesn\'t involve energy-wasteful `proof of work`.\n\nWe aim to create a secure and scalable decentralized computer formed by a large number of desktop PCs at home.\n\nWe are designing and coding a modern blockchain platform from the ground up for scale, security and speed based on the learnings of the achievements and mistakes of previous projects in this space.\n\nTo learn more about Spacemesh head over to [https://spacemesh.io](https://spacemesh.io).\n\nTo learn more about the Spacemesh protocol [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvtHFOlA1GI).\n\n### Motivation\nSpacemesh is designed to create a decentralized blockchain smart contracts computer and a cryptocurrency that is formed by connecting the home PCs of people from around the world into one virtual computer without incurring massive energy waste and mining pools issues that are inherent in other blockchain computers, and provide a provably-secure and incentive-compatible smart contracts execution environment.\n\nSpacemesh is designed to be ASIC-resistant and in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give an unfair advantage to rich parties who can afford setting up dedicated computers on the network. We achieve this by using a novel consensus protocol and optimize the software to be most effectively be used on home PCs that are also used for interactive apps.\n\n### What is this good for?\nProvide dapp and app developers with a robust way to add value exchange and other value related features to their apps at scale. Our goal is to create a truly decentralized cryptocurrency that fulfills the original vision behind bitcoin to become a secure trustless store of value as well as a transactional currency with extremely low transaction fees.\n\n### Target Users\ngo-spacemesh is designed to be installed and operated on users\' home PCs to form one decentralized computer. It is going to be distributed in the Spacemesh App but people can also build and run it from source code.\n\n### Project Status\nWe are working hard towards our first major milestone - a public permissionless testnet running the Spacemesh consensus protocol.\n\n### Contributing\nThank you for considering to contribute to the go-spacemesh open source project!\n\nWe welcome contributions large and small and we actively accept contributions.\n\n- go-spacemesh is part of [The Spacemesh open source project](https://spacemesh.io), and is MIT licensed open source software.\n\n- We welcome collaborators to the Spacemesh core dev team.\n\n- You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to contribute code! Many important types of contributions are important for our project.

Read [this](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-to-install-and-activate-module-support) for alternatives.\n\n### Setting Up Local Environment\n\nInstall [Go 1.11 or later](https://golang.org/dl/) for your platform, if you haven\'t already.\n\nEnsure that `$GOPATH` is set correctly and that the `$GOPATH/bin` directory appears in `$PATH`.\n\nBefore building we need to install `protoc` (ProtoBuf compiler) and some tools required to generate ProtoBufs. Do this by running:\n```bash\nmake install\n```\nThis will invoke `setup_env.sh` which supports Linux and MacOS. On other platforms it should be straightforward to follow the steps in this script manually.\n\n\n### Building\nTo build `go-spacemesh` for your current system architecture, from the project root directory, use:\n```\nmake build\n```\n\nThis will (re-)generate protobuf files and build the `go-spacemesh` binary, saving it in the `build/` directory.\n\nTo build a binary for a specific architecture directory use:\n```\nmake darwin | linux | windows\n```\n\nPlatform-specific binaries are saved to the `/build` directory.\n\n### Running\n```\n./build/go-spacemesh\n```\n\n### Testing\n\n*NOTE*: if tests are hanging try running `ulimit -n 400`. some tests require that to work.\n\n```\nmake test\n```\nor\n```\nmake cover\n```\n\n### Docker\nA `Dockerfile` is included in the project allowing anyone to build and run a docker image:\n```bash\ndocker build -t spacemesh .\ndocker run -d --name=spacemesh spacemesh\n```\n\n### Windows\nOn windows you will need the following prerequisites:\n- Powershell - included by in Windows by default since Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2\n- Git for Windows - after installation remove `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin` from System PATH and add `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd` to System PATH\n- Make - after installation add `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32\\bin` to System PATH\n\nYou can then run the command `make install` followed by `make build` as on unix based systems.\n\n### Running a Local Testnet\n- You can run a local Spacemesh Testent with 6 full nodes, 6 user accounts, and 1 POET support service on your computer using docker. \n- The local testnet full nodes are built from this repo.\n- This is a great way to get a feel for the protocol and the platform and to start hacking on Spacemesh.\n- Follow the steps in our [Local Testnet Guide](https://testnet.spacemesh.io/#/README)\n\n#### Next Steps...\n- Please visit our [wiki](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/wiki)\n- Browse project [go docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh)\n- Spacemesh Protocol [video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvtHFOlA1GI)\n\n### Status\n\nPlease install the Zenhub browser extension to view the go-spacemesh workspaces below.\n\n[P2P](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh#workspaces/go-spacemesh-59f1e073ac463071b57d474f/boards?labels=p2p&repos=108372143)\n\n[Sync Protocol](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh#workspaces/go-spacemesh-59f1e073ac463071b57d474f/boards?labels=sync&repos=108372143)\n\n[Hare Protocol](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh#workspaces/go-spacemesh-59f1e073ac463071b57d474f/boards?labels=hare%20protocol&repos=108372143)\n\n[Global State](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh#workspaces/go-spacemesh-59f1e073ac463071b57d474f/boards?labels=global%20state&repos=108372143)\n\n### Got Questions?\n- Introduce yourself and ask anything on the [spacemesh gitter channel](https://gitter.im/spacemesh-os/Lobby).\n- DM [@teamspacemesh](https://twitter.com/teamspacemesh)\n'
