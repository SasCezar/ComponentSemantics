It hosts and wraps [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net), making it behave more like a native macOS application and less like a command-line utility with a web browser interface.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n * Open the Syncthing WebGUI from the tray in your preferred browser.\n * Optionally starts on login, so you don\'t need to set up Syncthing as a service.\n * Tray icon indicates when it is connected to syncthing (no status updates yet).\n * Retina ready icons for the Application bundle and status tray.\n * Automatic updates (using [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org) pushed from github releases).\n * Open shared folders directly in Finder.\n\n# Screenshot\n\n<img alt="screenshot.png" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1050166/48157165-35970f00-e2cf-11e8-8009-10bfbf7fbce2.png">\n\n# Installation\n\n**NOTICE**: This is the official Syncthing macOS application bundle. Please make sure you have no other [syncthing instances](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/autostart.html#macos)\n            or [wrappers running](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/contrib.html#mac-os) or else this application will not work!\n\nCurrently, OS X 10.10 or higher is necessary. **syncthing-macos** is packaged as a disk image as an application bundled with the [syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) binary.\n\nTo install just download the dmg, mount it and drag and drop the application to install. The only necessary configuration is to set the API key and URL when provisioning a remote syncthing instance, the local instance is auto-configured. The application automatically keeps the syncthing binary updated, while running.\n\nThe latest version is available at [Github Releases](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-macos/releases/latest), or it can also be installed using [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) `brew cask install syncthing`\n\n# Why\n\nAll cross-platform approaches are not able to use all the native facilities of macOS. Including auto-updates,\n vector icon set (retina-ready) and creating an application bundle. GUIs are designed with XCode and everything\n is coded in Objective-C and Swift which is "the native approach".\n\n# Compiling\n\nBuild with XCode or run:\n\n```\nmake debug\n```\n\nIt will automaticly download syncthing amd64 binary and add it to the Application Bundle.\n\nFor release builds signing the application build and creating an distributable DMG:\n\n```\nmake release-dmg\n```\n\nThe script will select the first available Developer ID and sign the app with it. To specify the signing identity, use `SYNCTHING_APP_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` environment variable:\n\n```\nSYNCTHING_APP_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Mac Developer: foo@bar.com (XB59MXU8EC)" make release-dmg\n```\n\n# Goal\n\nThe goal of this project is to keep the Native macOS Syncthing tray as simple as possible. No graphs, no advanced configuration\n windows. It just provides a very simple wrapper so users are not aware syncthing ships as a commandline application. It strives to have a usability of good-by-default and should always follow the [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos) to feel as much as an native application as possible.\n\n# Known bugs\n\nSee the [issue tracker](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-macos/issues) for the current status.\n\n# Design\n\nDesign, internals and build process is documented in [doc/design.md](doc/design.md)\n\n# Contributions\n\n[Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [issue reports](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-macos/issues) are welcome.\n\n# License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n'
