The files cannot be censored as they are sent stored and transmitted decentralised because it uses the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).\n\nIPFS is a media distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.\n\n![Filenation screenshot](/static/filenation.png)\n\nFileNation is quite young but we already have some interesting achievements:\n\n- Launch of the first functional version of our Product (MVP)\n\n- First position in the Ranking of **HackerNews** (one of the most prestigious sites about technology)\n\n- More than 600 stars in **GitHub** showing the interest of the tech community.\n\n## Run on your own computer\n\nIf you would like to test Filenation on your own computer make sure you have Node installed and clone this repo\n\n      git clone https://github.com/Filenation/Filenation\n\nGo into the folder and download modules:\n\n      npm i\n\n\nTestrun the the App on http://localhost:4200 with:\n\n      npm start\n\nThere you go. If you later wish to build the code for production please run:\n\n    npm run prod or npm run prod:hashless\n\n\nFor automated angular documentation, please use:\n\n    npm run compodoc:w\n\n\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Main Framework**: [Angular](https://angular.io/) Lead: @alexsicart\n\n**Libraries**: [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)\n\n**Server**: Private (Python) Lead: @polbaladas\n\n## Contributors\n\nWe love pull requests from everyone.
