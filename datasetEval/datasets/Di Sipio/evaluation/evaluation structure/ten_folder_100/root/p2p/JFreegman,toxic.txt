Adding options to this file allows you to enable auto-logging, change the time format (12/24 hour), and much more.\nYou can view our example config file [here](misc/toxic.conf.example).\n\n## Troubleshooting\nIf your default prefix is "/usr/local" and you receive the following:\n```\nerror while loading shared libraries: libtoxcore.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n```\nyou can attempt to correct it by running `sudo ldconfig`. If that doesn\'t work, run:\n```\necho \'/usr/local/lib/\' | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/locallib.conf\nsudo ldconfig\n```\n\n'
