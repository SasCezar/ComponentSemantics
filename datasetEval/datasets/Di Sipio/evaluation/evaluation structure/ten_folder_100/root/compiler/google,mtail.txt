Using the\nlatest production release binary is the recommended way of installing **mtail**.\n\nWindows, OSX and Linux binaries are available.\n\n### Building from source\n\nThe simplest way to get `mtail` is to `go get` it directly.\n\n`go get github.com/google/mtail/cmd/mtail`\n\nThis assumes you have a working Go environment with a recent Go version.  Usually mtail is tested to work with the last two minor versions  (e.g. Go 1.12 and Go 1.11).\n\nIf you want to fetch everything, you need to turn on Go Modules to succeed because of the way Go Modules have changed the way go get treats source trees with no Go code at the top level.\n\n```\nGO111MODULE=on go get -u github.com/google/mtail\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/mtail\nmake install\n```\n\nIf you develop the compiler you will need some additional tools\nlike `goyacc` to be able to rebuild the parser.\n\nSee the [Build instructions](docs/Building.md) for more details.\n\nA `Dockerfile` is included in this repository for local development as an\nalternative to installing Go in your environment, and takes care of all the\nbuild dependency installation, if you don\'t care for that.\n\n\n## Deployment\n\n`mtail` works best when it paired with a timeseries-based calculator and\nalerting tool, like [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io).\n\n> So what you do is you take the metrics from the log files and\n> you bring them down to the monitoring system?\n\n[It deals with the instrumentation so the engineers don\'t have\nto!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/quotes/qt0386890)  It has the\nextraction skills!  It is good at dealing with log files!!\n\n## Read More\n\nFull documentation at http://google.github.io/mtail/\n\nRead more about writing `mtail` programs:\n\n* [Programming Guide](docs/Programming-Guide.md)\n* [Language Reference](docs/Language.md)\n* [Metrics](docs/Metrics.md)\n* [Managing internal state](docs/state.md)\n* [Testing your programs](docs/Testing.md)\n\nRead more about hacking on `mtail`\n\n* [Building from source](docs/Building.md)\n* [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* [Style](docs/style.md)\n\nRead more about deploying `mtail` and your programs in a monitoring environment\n\n* [Deploying](docs/Deploying.md)\n* [Interoperability](docs/Interoperability.md) with other systems\n* [Troubleshooting](docs/Troubleshooting.md)\n* [FAQ](docs/faq.md)\n\nAfter that, if you have any questions, please email (and optionally join) the mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mtail-users or [file a new issue](https://github.com/google/mtail/issues/new).\n'
