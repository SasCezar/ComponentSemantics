b'## What is it?\n\n1. A simple stack-based virtual machine that runs C in the browser.\n\n2. An interactive tutorial that covers C, how the VM works, and how the language is compiled, everything from the ground up.\n\n## Why?\n\nThis project demystifies compilers without getting lost in unnecessary details. \nMiniC visually explores how a compiler can break down the C language into simple instructions and how those are executed by a virtual CPU. \n\n![alt text](/gif/both.gif)\n\n## Can I see it?\n\n1.

The top of the stack is the returned value of the function\n\nCALL:\n  a sequence of simpler instructions performed to CALL a function. it assumes that the address of the function followed by all the arguments have already been pushed\n  * Pushes IP (which was already increased by 1), effectively pushing the address of the next instruction. This value will be used by the RET instrunction to set IP to the address of next instrunction after CALL\n  * sets ip to SP - 1 - argument, with is the address of the FSTART instrunction of the function being called\n\nALLOC:\n* generated by the new operator\n* a sequence of simpler instructions performed to ALLOCate memory dynammically\n  * remembers the value on the top of the stack, which is the requsted amount of memory\n  * saves the value of HP\n  * increases HP by the requsted amount of memory\n  * pushes the previously saved value of HP onto the stack \n\nASSIGN:\n* used to chnage the value at some address to the value on the top of the stack (ASSiGNment), e.g. "a = 2;"\n* remembers VAL, the value on the top of the stack\n* sets the value at address SP - 1 to VAL\n* performs a POP\n* sets the value on the top of the stack to VAL. This leaves the door open to multiple variable assignment (such as "a = b = 3;")\n\nPLUSEQ:\n* just like ASSIGN, but performs addition instead of replacing the value (e.g. a += 2;)\n\nMINUSEQ:\n* just like ASSIGN, but performs subtraction instead of replacing the value (e.g. a -= 2;)\n\nTIMESEQ:\n* just like ASSIGN, but performs multiplication instead of replacing the value (e.g. a *= 2;)\n\nDIVEQ:\n* just like ASSIGN, but performs division instead of replacing the value (e.g. a /= 2;)\n\nMODEQ:\n* just like ASSIGN, but performs the moduls operation instead of replacing the value (e.g. a %= 2;)\n\n\n\nTIMES:\n* POPs the two values on the top of the stack, multiplies them, and pushes the result (e.g. 6 * 3)\n\nDIV:\n* POPs the two values on the top of the stack, divides them, and pushes the result (e.g. 6 / 3)\n\nMOD:\n* POPs the two values on the top of the stack, performs the modulus operation on them, and pushes the result (e.g. 6 % 3)\n\nPLUS:\n* POPs the two values on the top of the stack, adds them, and pushes the result (e.g. 6 + 3)\n\nMINUS:\n* POPs the two values on the top of the stack, substracts them, and pushes the result (e.g. 6 - 3)\n\n### Missing language features\n\n* only bool, int, char and pointers as data types and they all have the same size in memory\n\n* no malloc, but operator new is working (like in C++), \n\n* no static arrays and structs (dynamic arrays and pointer to structs work fine).\n  \n* no arrays of structs (arrays of pointers to structs works fine).\n  \n* no for and switch statements\n\n* no preprocessor directives\n  \n* no bitwise operators\n  \n* no ++, --, ternary operators\n  \n* no union and no enum\n  \n* no global variables\n\n* no function pointers\n\n* no free / delete operator\n\n* no function overloading\n'
