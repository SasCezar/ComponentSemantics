b'# The F# compiler, F# core library, and F# editor tools\n\nYou\'re invited to contribute to future releases of the F# compiler, core library, and tools. Development of this repository can be done on any OS supported by [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Quickstart on Windows\n\nBuild from the command line:\n\n```\nbuild.cmd\n```\n\nThe build depends on an installation of Visual Studio. To build the compiler without this dependency use:\n\n```\nbuild.cmd -noVisualStudio\n```\n\nAfter it\'s finished, open either `FSharp.sln` or `VisualFSharp.sln` in your editor of choice. The latter solution is larger but includes the F# tools for Visual Studio and its associated infrastructure.\n\n### Quickstart on Linux or macOS\n\nBuild from the command line:\n\n```\n./build.sh\n```\n\nAfter it\'s finished, open `FSharp.sln` in your editor of choice.\n\n### More options and information\n\nSee [DEVGUIDE.md](DEVGUIDE.md) and [TESTGUIDE.md](TESTGUIDE.md) for more details on additional configurations for building and testing, how to update compiler error messages, and more.\n\n### No contribution is too small\n\nEven if you find a single-character typo, we\'re happy to take the change! Although the codebase can feel daunting for beginners, we and other contributors are happy to help you along.\n\n## Build Status\n\n| Branch | Status |\n|:------:|:------:|\n|master|[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_apis/build/status/dotnet/fsharp/fsharp-ci?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/latest?definitionId=496&branchName=master)|\n\n## Using nightly releases in Visual Studio\n\nYou can use the latest `master` build of the F# compiler and tools for Visual Studio via our nightly releases if you are a Visual Studio user. See details on setup here:\n\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/03/14/announcing-nightly-releases-for-the-visual-f-tools/\n\n### Even more nightly than the nightly\n\nAlternatively, if you _really_ want to live on the bleeding edge, you can set up a nightly feed for the Visual Studio preview releases, which use the latest commit in the preview branch. To do so, follow the same instructions as the above blog post, but instead with these links:\n\n* Set your feed to the preview feed: https://dotnet.myget.org/F/fsharp-preview/vsix\n* Install a VSIX manually from the preview feed: https://dotnet.myget.org/feed/fsharp-preview/package/vsix/VisualFSharp\n\n## Branches\n\nThese are the branches in use:\n\n* `master`\n  - Most contributions go here.\n  - Able to be built, installed and used in the latest public Visual Studio release.\n  - May contain updated F# features and logic.\n  - Used to build nightly VSIX (see above).\n  - Gets integrated into https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp to form the basis of Mono releases\n  - Gets integrated into https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service to form the basis of FSharp.Compiler.Service releases\n\n* `dev15.9`\n  - Long-term servicing branch for VS 2017 update 15.9.x. We do not expect to service that release, but if we do, that\'s where the changes will go.\n\n* `dev16.x`\n  - Latest release branch for the particular point release of Visual Studio.\n  - Incorporates features and fixes from master up to a particular branch point, then selective cherry-picks.\n  - May contain new features that depend on new things or fixes in the corresponding forthcoming Visual Studio release.\n  - Gets integrated back into master once the corresponding Visual Studio release is made.\n\n## F# language and core library evolution\n\nEvolution of the F# language and core library follows a process spanning two additional repositories. The process is as follows:\n\n1. Use the [F# language suggestions repo](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/) to search for ideas, vote on ones you like, submit new ideas, and discuss details with the F# community.\n2. Ideas that are "approved in principle" are eligible for a new RFC in the [F# language design repo](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design). This is where the technical specification and discussion of approved suggestions go.\n3. Implementations and testing of an RFC are submitted to this repository.\n\n## Additional project documentation\n\nThe following links can help you get an overview of some technical aspects of the F# language and compiler:\n\n* [The F# Compiler Technical Guide](https://fsharp.github.io/2015/09/29/fsharp-compiler-guide.html)\n* [The F# Language Specification](https://fsharp.org/specs/language-spec/)\n\n## License\n\nThis project is subject to the MIT License.

You can find support from other contributors in the `#compiler` and `#editor-support` channels.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `#fsharp` tag on Twitter if you have general F# questions, including about this repository. Chances are you\'ll get multiple responses.\n\n## About F\\#\n\nIf you\'re curious about F# itself, check out these links:\n\n* [What is F#](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/what-is-fsharp)\n* [Get started with F#](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/)\n* [F# Software Foundation](https://fsharp.org)\n* [F# Testimonials](https://fsharp.org/testimonials)\n'
