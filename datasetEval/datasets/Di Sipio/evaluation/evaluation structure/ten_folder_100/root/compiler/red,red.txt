Once complete, Red will be [self-hosted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting).\n\nThe Red software stack also contains another language, **Red/System**, which is a low-level dialect of Red. It is a limited C-level language with a Red look\'n feel, required to build Red\'s runtime library and be the target language of Red\'s compiler. More information at [red-lang.org](http://www.red-lang.org).\n\nMaking a Red "Hello World"\n------------------------\nThe Red toolchain comes as a single **one-megabyte** executable file that you can download from [here](http://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html) for the big-3 platforms.\n\n1. Put the downloaded **red** binary in the working folder.\n\n2. In a code or text editor, write the following Hello World program:\n\n        Red [\n            Title: "Simple hello world script"\n        ]\n\n        print "Hello World!"\n\n3. Save it under the name: **hello.red**\n\n4. From a terminal (works from DOS too), run it with:\n\n        $ red hello.red\n\n5. You should see the _Hello World!_ output.\n\n6. Want to generate a compiled executable from that program?\n\n        $ red -c hello.red\n        $ ./hello\n\n7. Want to generate a compiled executable from that program with no dependencies?\n\n        $ red -r hello.red\n        $ ./hello\n\n8. Want to cross-compile to another supported platform?\n\n        $ red -t Windows hello.red\n        $ red -t Darwin hello.red\n        $ red -t Linux-ARM hello.red\n\n**The command-line syntax is:**\n\n    red [command] [options] [file]\n\n`[file]` any Red or Red/System source file. If no file and no option is provided, the graphical interactive console will be launched. If a file with no option is provided, the file will be simply run by the interpreter (it is expected to be a Red script with no Red/System code).\n\nNote: On Non-Windows platforms, the REPL runs by default in CLI mode. But on Windows, the default is to run in GUI mode. To run it in the command line mode, invoke the red binary with the option `--cli`.\n\n`[options]`\n\n    -c, --compile                  : Generate an executable in the working\n                                     folder, using libRedRT.

Just run the `red` binary with no option to access the [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).\n\n        ---== Red 0.6.3 ==-- \n        Type HELP for starting information. \n\n        >>\n\n1. You can use it to test rapidly some Red code:\n\n        >> 1 + 2\n        == 3\n\n        >> inc: func [n][n + 1]\n        == func [n][n + 1]\n\n        >> inc 123\n        == 124\n\n  \nNotes:\n\n- On Windows, the REPL runs by default in GUI mode. To run it in the command line, invoke the red binary as `red --cli`.\n- Wine has some [issues](https://github.com/red/red/issues/1618) with the GUI-Console. Install the `Consolas` font to fix the problem.\n\n\nRunning Red from the sources (for contributors)\n------------------------\nThe compiler and linker are currently written in Rebol. Please follow the instructions for installing the compiler toolchain in order to run it from sources:\n\n1. Clone this git repository or download an archive (`ZIP` button above or from [tagged packages](https://github.com/red/red/tags)).\n\n1. Download a Rebol interpreter suitable for your OS: [Windows](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-core-278-3-1.exe), [Linux](http://www.maxvessi.net/rebsite/Linux/) (or [Linux](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-core-278-4-2.tar.gz)), [Mac OS X](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-core-278-2-5.tar.gz), [FreeBSD](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-core-278-7-2.tar.gz), [OpenBSD](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-core-278-9-4.tar.gz), [Solaris](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v276/rebol-core-276-10-1.gz).\n\n1. Extract the `rebol` binary, put it in root folder, that\'s all!\n\n1. Let\'s test it: run `./rebol`, you\'ll see a `>>` prompt appear. Windows users need to double-click on the `rebol.exe` file to run it.\n\n1. From the REBOL console type:\n\n        >> do/args %red.r "%tests/hello.red"\n\nThe compilation process should finish with a `...output file size` message. The resulting binary is in the working folder. Windows users need to open a DOS console and run `hello.exe` from there.\n\nTo see the intermediary Red/System code generated by the compiler, use:\n\n        >> do/args %red.r "-v 2 %tests/hello.red"\n\nYou can also compile the Red console from source:\n\n        >> do/args %red.r "-r %environment/console/CLI/console.red"\n\nTo compile the Windows GUI console from source:\n\n        >> do/args %red.r "-r -t Windows %environment/console/GUI/gui-console.red"\n\nNote: the `-c` argument is not necessary when launching the Red toolchain from sources, as the default action is to compile the input script (the toolchain in binary form default action is to run the input script through the interpreter).\nThe `-r` argument is needed when compiling the Red console to make additional runtime functions available.\n\nNote: The red git repository does not include a .gitignore file. If you run the automated tests a number of files will be created that are not stored in the repository. Installing and renaming a copy of [.gitignore-sample](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/.gitignore-sample) file will ignore these generated files.\n\nContributing\n-------------------------\nIf you want to contribute code to the Red project be sure to read the [guidelines](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-Contributor-Guidelines) first.\n\nIt is usually a good idea to inform the Red team about what changes you are going to make in order to ensure that someone is not already working on the same thing. You can reach us through the [mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/red-lang) or our [chat room](https://gitter.im/red/red).\n\nSatisfied with the results of your change and want to issue a pull request on Github?\n\nMake sure the changes pass all the existing tests, add relevant tests to the test-suite and please test on as many platforms as you can. You can run all the tests using (from Rebol console, at repository root):\n\n        >> do %run-all.r\n\nGit integration with console built from sources\n-------------------------\nIf you want git version included in your Red console built from sources, use this command:\n```Red\ncall/show ""                                              ;-- patch call bug on Windows\nsave %build/git.r do %build/git-version.r                 ;-- lookup git version if available\ndo/args %red.r "-r %environment/console/CLI/console.red"  ;-- build Console\nwrite %build/git.r "none^/"                               ;-- restore git repo status\n```\n\nAnti-virus false positive\n-------------------------\nSome anti-virus programs are a bit too sensitive and can wrongly report an alert on some binaries generated by Red, if that happens to you, please fill a ticket [here](https://github.com/red/red/issues), so we can report the false positive.\n\nLicense\n-------------------------\nBoth Red and Red/System are published under [BSD](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-3-clause) license, runtime is under [BSL](http://www.boost.org/users/license.html) license. BSL is a bit more permissive license than BSD, more suitable for the runtime parts.\n'
