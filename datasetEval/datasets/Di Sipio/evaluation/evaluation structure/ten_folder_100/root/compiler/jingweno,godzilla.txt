b'# Godzilla: Go running JavaScript\n\n## Overview\n\nGodzilla is a [ES2015](http://babeljs.io/learn-es2015) to Go source code transpiler and runtime that is intended to be a near drop-in replacement for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).\nIt compiles ES2015 source code to Go source code which is then compiled to native code.\nThe compiled Go source code is a series of calls to the Godzilla runtime, a Go library serving a similar purpose to Node.js.\n\nGodzilla parses ES2015 source code with the awesome [babylon](https://github.com/babel/babylon).\nThat means at the moment Node.js is required for compilation.\nAs Godzilla becomes mature, `babylon` will be compiled to Go source code using Godzilla itself so that the Node.js dependency can be dropped.\n\n**Note that Godzilla is at a very early stage and only very few language features are implemented**\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/0e2ce574fm9d23mwxmfg0jo93.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/0e2ce574fm9d23mwxmfg0jo93)\n\n## Compiling\n\nMake sure Go and Node.js are installed properly, then run:\n\n```\n$ make\n```\n\n## Running\n\n```\n$ echo "console.log(\'Hello, Godzilla\')" | bin/godzilla run\nHello, Godzilla\n$ echo "console.log(\'Hello, Godzilla\')" | bin/godzilla build -o hello\n$ ./hello\nHello, Godzilla\n```\n\n## Performance\n\nThere are still lots of works to get Godzilla to a stable state, but this is one preliminary benchmark for a simple script about program startup time:\n\n```\n$ echo "console.log(\'Hello, Godzilla\')" | bin/godzilla build -o hello\n$ time ./hello\nHello, Godzilla\n./hello  0.00s user 0.00s system 30% cpu 0.013 total\n\n$ echo "console.log(\'Hello, Godzilla\')" > hello.js\n$ time node hello.js\nHello, Godzilla\nnode hello.js  0.07s user 0.03s system 70% cpu 0.137 total\n```\n\n## Talks\n\nYou can find my GopherCon 2017 lightening talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSW0nKArIvU).\n\n## Related Arts\n\n* [grumpy](https://github.com/google/grumpy)\n'
