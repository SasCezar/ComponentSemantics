There\n  is a bridge between Gitter and the IRC channel.\n* [Telegram][nim-telegram] - an additional place to discuss Nim in real-time. There\n  is the official Telegram channel.\n* [Stack Overflow][nim-stackoverflow] - a popular Q/A site for programming related\n  topics that includes posts about Nim.\n* [Github Wiki][nim-wiki] - Misc user-contributed content.\n\n## Compiling\n\nThe compiler currently officially supports the following platform and\narchitecture combinations:\n\n  * Windows (Windows XP or greater) - x86 and x86_64\n  * Linux (most, if not all, distributions) - x86, x86_64, ppc64 and armv6l\n  * Mac OS X (10.04 or greater) - x86, x86_64 and ppc64\n\nMore platforms are supported, however they are not tested regularly and they\nmay not be as stable as the above-listed platforms.\n\nCompiling the Nim compiler is quite straightforward if you follow these steps:\n\nFirst, the C source of an older version of the Nim compiler is needed to\nbootstrap the latest version because the Nim compiler itself is written in the\nNim programming language. Those C sources are available within the\n[``nim-lang/csources``][csources-repo] repository.\n\nNext, to build from source you will need:\n\n  * A C compiler such as ``gcc`` 3.x/later or an alternative such as ``clang``,\n    ``Visual C++`` or ``Intel C++``. It is recommended to use ``gcc`` 3.x or\n    later.\n  * Either ``git`` or ``wget`` to download the needed source repositories.\n  * The ``build-essential`` package when using ``gcc`` on Ubuntu (and likely\n    other distros as well).\n\nThen, if you are on a \\*nix system or Windows, the following steps should compile\nNim from source using ``gcc``, ``git`` and the ``koch`` build tool.\n\n**Note: The following commands are for the development version of the compiler.**\nFor most users, installing the latest stable version is enough. Check out\nthe installation instructions on the website to do so: https://nim-lang.org/install.html.\n\nFor package maintainers: see [packaging guidelines](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/packaging.html).\n\n\nFirst get Nim from github:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim.git\ncd Nim\n```\n\nNext run the appropriate build shell script for your platform:\n\n* `build_all.sh` (Linux, Mac)\n* `build_all.bat` (Windows)\n\n\nFinally, once you have finished the build steps (on Windows, Mac or Linux) you\nshould add the ``bin`` directory to your PATH.\n\n## Koch\n\n``koch`` is the build tool used to build various parts of Nim and to generate\ndocumentation and the website, among other things. The ``koch`` tool can also\nbe used to run the Nim test suite.\n\nAssuming that you added Nim\'s ``bin`` directory to your PATH, you may execute\nthe tests using ``./koch tests``. The tests take a while to run, but you\ncan run a subset of tests by specifying a category (for example\n``./koch tests cat async``).\n\nFor more information on the ``koch`` build tool please see the documentation\nwithin the [doc/koch.rst](doc/koch.rst) file.\n\n## Nimble\n\n``nimble`` is Nim\'s package manager. To learn more about it, see the\n[``nim-lang/nimble``][nimble-repo] repository.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.\n<a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/graphs/contributors"><img src="https://opencollective.com/Nim/contributors.svg?width=890" /></a>\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![Backers on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nim/backers/badge.svg)](#backers) [![Sponsors on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nim/sponsors/badge.svg)](#sponsors)\n[![Setup a bounty via Bountysource][badge-nim-bountysource]][nim-bountysource]\n[![Donate Bitcoins][badge-nim-bitcoin]][nim-bitcoin]\n[![Open Source Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/nim-lang/nim/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/nim-lang/nim)\n\nSee [detailed contributing guidelines](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/contributing.html).\nWe welcome all contributions to Nim regardless of how small or large\nthey are. Everything from spelling fixes to new modules to be included in the\nstandard library are welcomed and appreciated. Before you start contributing,\nyou should familiarize yourself with the following repository structure:\n\n* ``bin/``, ``build/`` - these directories are empty, but are used when Nim is built.\n* ``compiler/`` - the compiler source code. Also includes nimfix, and plugins within\n  ``compiler/nimfix`` and ``compiler/plugins`` respectively.\n* ``nimsuggest`` - the nimsuggest tool that previously lived in the [``nim-lang/nimsuggest``][nimsuggest-repo] repository.\n* ``config/`` - the configuration for the compiler and documentation generator.\n* ``doc/`` - the documentation files in reStructuredText format.\n* ``lib/`` - the standard library, including:\n    * ``pure/`` - modules in the standard library written in pure Nim.\n    * ``impure/`` - modules in the standard library written in pure Nim with\n    dependencies written in other languages.\n    * ``wrappers/`` - modules which wrap dependencies written in other languages.\n* ``tests/`` - contains categorized tests for the compiler and standard library.\n* ``tools/`` - the tools including ``niminst`` and ``nimweb`` (mostly invoked via\n  ``koch``).\n* ``koch.nim`` - tool used to bootstrap Nim, generate C sources, build the website,\n  and generate the documentation.\n\nIf you are not familiar with making a pull request using GitHub and/or git, please\nread [this guide][pull-request-instructions].\n\nIdeally you should make sure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.\nHowever, if you are short on time, you can just run the tests specific to your\nchanges by only running the corresponding categories of tests. Travis CI verifies\nthat all tests pass before allowing the pull request to be accepted, so only\nrunning specific tests should be harmless.\nIntegration tests should go in ``tests/untestable``.\n\nIf you\'re looking for ways to contribute, please look at our [issue tracker][nim-issues].\nThere are always plenty of issues labelled [``Easy``][nim-issues-easy]; these should\nbe a good starting point for an initial contribution to Nim.\n\nYou can also help with the development of Nim by making donations. Donations can be\nmade using:\n\n* [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nim)\n* [Bountysource][nim-bountysource]\n* [Bitcoin][nim-bitcoin]\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to submit a question on the\n[Nim forum][nim-forum], or via IRC on [the \\#nim channel][nim-irc].\n\n\n## Backers\n\nThank you to all our backers!
