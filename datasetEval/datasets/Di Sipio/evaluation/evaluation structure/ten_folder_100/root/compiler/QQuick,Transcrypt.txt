There are some exceptions to this rule, e.g. math, cmath, random, itertools, re, time, datetime and turtle, and some more may follow, but in general the accent is on libraries that are relevant in the browser.\n- No eval and exec of Python code. This is again part of the concept. Transcrypt code is compiled, optimized and minified in advance to warant fast page loads. In this respect its design goal is fundamentally different from tools that compile on the fly in the browser. Transcrypt is targeted towards building professional, extensive, real world web applications that load and run as fast as their JavaScript counterparts, but offers Pythonically clean, modular structure and maintainability.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nCopyright 2014 - 2018 Jacques de Hooge, GEATEC engineering, www.geatec.com\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\nHow to contribute\n=================\n\nTranscrypt started out as a personal repo, owned by Jacques de Hooge.\nAs the project caught on and the number of people contributing issues, ideas and code grew,\nthe repo was transferred to the QQuick organisation, to be able to form a developer team on GitHub.\n\nThere was also a clear message in this: Transcrypt isn\'t owned by anyone in particular.\nIt is the collective property of everyone using it or contributing to it.\nAt the same time the need was felt to keep a very firm grip on code quality, especially of the core.\n\nEverything under ../transcrypt/modules/org/transcrypt plus the file ../transcrypt/\\_\\_main\\_\\_.py is considered to be part of Transcrypt\'s core.\nA major design goal is to keep the core small and fast. This means that some CPython facilities were deliberately left out or simplified.\nCore development is still mainly done by Jacques, but with the input of many great ideas submitted as issues.\nIf you want to improve something in the core, this is best initiated by first opening an issue for it.\nOpening a pull request directly can lead to disappointment, although all effort is made to take good ideas seriously.\n\nAll other parts of Transcrypt are referred to as periphery.\nWhile a good quality pull request for the periphery stands a reasonable chance of being accepted,\nstill it is wise to start an issue beforehand, allowing coordination and preventing waste of effort.\n\nA special place is taken by implementing standard libraries. While Transcrypt mostly relies on browser-centric JavaScript libraries,\navailability of a limited number of standard libraries will help acceptance by Python programmers. So you\'re most welcome to make a contribution here.\nThe design goal again is: better 90% complete, fast, small, and reliable, than 100% complete, slow, bulky and buggy.\nIf you contribute a library, please also contribute an autotest (see docs) and some documentation for it.\nThe supported platforms are Windows and Linux (and, with that, OsX).\n\nWhile being open and respectful to any good ideas, the final say as to what gets in and what doesn\'t, is with Jacques.\nSo this is a dictatorial rather than a democratic project.\nBeing a sailer himself, Jacques values the notion of having one captain on a ship.\nThe captain doesn\'t own the ship, but he serves the passengers by consulting with the crew and plotting one stable course.\n\nAnother possibility to contribute libraries to Transcrypt is by submitting them as separate packages to PyPi.\nIn that case be sure to add the keyword Transcrypt to allow people to find your package.\nMaking your package pip-installable will also help it to catch on.\nContributing packages via PyPi of course means total freedom for the developer.\n\nDevelopment build status\n========================\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/QQuick/Transcrypt.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/QQuick/Transcrypt\n\nThe icon above shows the outcome of the continous integration test that is done on Linux after each commit.\nThe test consists of running a set of testlets, systematically covering all facilities of Transcrypt. Each testlet performs an automated back to back test against CPython.\n\nThe full set of testlets is described in the documentation and comes with the distribution.\nSince the branching model has been deliberately kept simple, continuous integration may be transiently broken.\nIn that case you can use the latest passing version, that you\'ll find by clicking on the icon above and then on \'Build History\'.\n\nEach release, on the other hand, is preceded by at least the following tests:\n\n- The automated back to back test described above, not only on Linux but also on Windows and, in case of relevant issues, on OsX.\n- Automated compilation of the manual tests, human exercising of the resulting applications and a visual check of the results.\n- Automated compilation of the demo\'s, human exercising of the resulting applications and a visual check of the results.\n- A documentation build, followed by a visual sample check.\n\nWhat\'s new in the latest commits\n================================\n\n- Parcel bundler demo simplified and added to demo directory, included in shipment test\n- Executable comments: skip code either in CPython or, with the skip pragma, in Transcrypt (issue 602)\n- Integration with Parcel bundler incl. auto-reload (issue 596)\n- Correct formatting of None fixed, autotests added (issue 494, issue 515)\n- Invalid link removed from doc (issue 595)\n- Fix for ameclass with \'async\' verified (issue 543)\n- Fix for js_is and py_is aliases verified (issue 562)\n- Selenium tests tab switching and alert handling fixed\n- Compilation error reports fixed (pr584, issue 586)\n- Module paths can now contain dots (issue 578 revisited)\n- Module name can be reexported (pr 575)\n- Exported vars can contain $ (issue 578)\n- Import now can contain hyphens in filename (issue 576), (-am / -alimod switch)\n- Import and re-export via __init__.py fixed (issue 559)\n- Extension .py allowed for source file name on command line (issue 569)\n- Minimal recompilation (make versus build) fixed, was broken after introduction of modules (pull request 560)\n- -dl / -dlog "Log compiler messages to file" switch added\n- Static typing tutorial repaired\n- Builtin pow function added\n- Context managers added + testcases\n- Python 3.7 dataclasses added + testcases\n- Everything written in __target__ subdir rather than installation dir\n- Python modules now implemented as ES6 modules pervasively, multiple apps per page, runtime and libs only once\n- String formatting mini language added as an option (-sf / --sform switch) + autotest\n- Div internal improvements and fixes\n- Time module made suitable for use in combination with Node.js\n- Single line pragma\'s (issue 460) + doc + autotest\n- Negative list indices allowed when operator overloading is enabled (issue 460)\n- Added pragma\'s and switches jscall and nojscall, 30% speedup, use only locally for insulated methods in a class\n- Fix for callable (None) (issue 450)\n- Start made with /tutorials/baseline mini Python tutorial\n- Fix for decorator from module (issue 448)\n- Examples for datetime, time and re added to docs\n- Module datetime added (pr 435)\n- Conjugate of real now compiled correctly\n- Property decorators now supported for getters and setters\n- Metaclasses and method decorators now execute in correct order (issue 430)\n- Complex numbers now support comparison operators and conjugate\n- Max and min now accept sequences (issue 331)\n- Aliasers more completely dealt with in combination with keyword args and getattr, setattr, hasattr, delattr (issue 414)\n- Compiler switch -xt / --xtiny added to considerably reduce size of runtime if operator overloading isn\'t used\n- Compiler switch -dn / --dnostrip added to avoid stripping comments in __builtin__ and __core__\n- Comments in __builtin__ and __core__ JavaScript-only modules are now stripped by default\n- Initial support for bytes and bytearrays added (issue 405 a.o.)\n- Remark about heuristic interpretation of dictionary keys added to docs (issue 401)\n- Fisher-Yates shuffle added to random module\n- Exception type TypeError added, currently unused by Transcrypt itself (issue 365)\n- Name of main program file now really doesn\'t need .py extension anymore...
