b'# ShivyC [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC) [![Code Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC)\n\n### A hobby C compiler created in Python.\n\n![ShivyC demo GIF.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC/master/demo.gif)\n\n---\n\nShivyC is a hobby C compiler written in Python 3 that supports a subset of the C11 standard and generates reasonably efficient binaries, including some optimizations. ShivyC also generates helpful compile-time error messages.\n\nThis [implementation of a trie](tests/general_tests/trie/trie.c) is an example of what ShivyC can compile today. For a more comprehensive list of features, see the [feature test directory](tests/feature_tests).\n\n## Quickstart\n\n### x86-64 Linux\nShivyC requires only Python 3.6 or later to compile C code. Assembling and linking are done using the GNU binutils and glibc, which you almost certainly already have installed.\n\nTo install ShivyC:\n```\npip3 install shivyc\n```\nTo create, compile, and run an example program:\n```c\n$ vim hello.c\n$ cat hello.c\n\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n  printf("hello, world!\\n");\n}\n\n$ shivyc hello.c\n$ ./out\nhello, world!\n```\nTo run the tests:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC.git\ncd ShivyC\npython3 -m unittest discover\n```\n\n### Other Architectures\nFor the convenience of those not running Linux, the [`docker/`](docker/) directory provides a Dockerfile that sets up an x86-64 Linux Ubuntu environment with everything necessary for ShivyC. To use this, run:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC.git\ncd ShivyC\ndocker build -t shivyc docker/\ndocker/shell\n```\nThis will open up a shell in an environment with ShivyC installed and ready to use with\n```\nshivyc any_c_file.c           # to compile a file\npython3 -m unittest discover  # to run tests\n```\nThe Docker ShivyC executable will update live with any changes made in your local ShivyC directory.\n\n## Implementation Overview\n#### Preprocessor\nShivyC today has a very limited preprocessor that parses out comments and expands `#include` directives. These features are implemented between [`lexer.py`](shivyc/lexer.py) and [`preproc.py`](shivyc/lexer.py).\n\n#### Lexer\nThe ShivyC lexer is implemented primarily in [`lexer.py`](shivyc/lexer.py). Additionally, [`tokens.py`](shivyc/tokens.py) contains definitions of the token classes used in the lexer and [`token_kinds.py`](shivyc/token_kinds.py) contains instances of recognized keyword and symbol tokens.\n\n#### Parser\nThe ShivyC parser uses recursive descent techniques for all parsing. It is implented in [`parser/*.py`](shivyc/parser/) and creates a parse tree of nodes defined in [`tree/nodes.py`](shivyc/tree/nodes.py) and [`tree/expr_nodes.py`](shivyc/tree/expr_nodes.py).\n\n#### IL generation\nShivyC traverses the parse tree to generate a flat custom IL (intermediate language). The commands for this IL are in [`il_cmds/*.py`](shivyc/il_cmds/) . Objects used for IL generation are in [`il_gen.py`](shivyc/il_gen.py) , but most of the IL generating code is in the `make_code` function of each tree node in [`tree/*.py`](shivyc/tree/).\n\n#### ASM generation\nShivyC sequentially reads the IL commands, converting each into Intel-format x86-64 assembly code. ShivyC performs register allocation using George and Appel\xe2\x80\x99s iterated register coalescing algorithm (see References below). The general ASM generation functionality is in [`asm_gen.py`](shivyc/asm_gen.py) , but much of the ASM generating code is in the `make_asm` function of each IL command in [`il_cmds/*.py`](shivyc/il_cmds/).\n\n## Contributing\nPull requests to ShivyC are very welcome. A good place to start is the [Issues page](https://github.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC/issues). All [issues labeled "feature"](https://github.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature) are TODO tasks. [Issues labeled "bug"](https://github.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) are individual miscompilations in ShivyC. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments of the relevant issue or create a new issue labeled "question". Of course, please add test(s) for all new functionality.\n\nMany thanks to our current and past contributers:\n* [ShivamSarodia](https://github.com/ShivamSarodia)\n* [cclauss](https://github.com/cclauss)\n* [TBladen](https://github.com/tbladen)\n* [christian-stephen](https://github.com/christian-stephen)\n* [jubnzv](https://github.com/jubnzv)\n* [eriols](https://github.com/eriols)\n\n## References\n- [ShivC](https://github.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivC) - ShivyC is a rewrite from scratch of my old C compiler, ShivC, with much more emphasis on feature completeness and code quality.
