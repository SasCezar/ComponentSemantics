b'## Nightwatch custom commands and assertions\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maxgalbu/nightwatch-custom-commands-assertions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maxgalbu/nightwatch-custom-commands-assertions) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/nightwatch-custom-commands-assertions.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/nightwatch-custom-commands-assertions)\n\nThese are some commands and assertion I use when I\'m testing with nightwatch.js and selenium.\n\n### How to use these things?\n\nYou can install it using npm:\n\n```\nnpm install nightwatch-custom-commands-assertions --save-dev\n```\n\nThen, open the nightwatch.json file in your editor (or [create it if it doesn\'t exist](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#settings-file)) and edit the `custom_commands_path` and `custom_assertions_path` keys so they look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n\t... //your config\n\t\n\t"custom_commands_path" : "node_modules/nightwatch-custom-commands-assertions/js/commands",\n\t"custom_assertions_path" : "node_modules/nightwatch-custom-commands-assertions/js/assertions",\n\t\n\t... //your config again\n}\n```\n\nNow you should be able to use these commands/assertions when you call `nightwatch --test`.\n\n### Alternative ways of installing\n\n- Go into your `tests` folder (or where your nightwatch.json is) and do:\n  \n  ```\n  git clone https://github.com/maxgalbu/nightwatch-custom-commands-assertions.git\n  ```\n\n- Download the zipped repository [here](https://github.com/maxgalbu/nightwatch-custom-commands-assertions/archive/master.zip) and extract it wherever you want\n\nYou then need to open your nightwatch.json and edit `custom_commands_path` and `custom_assertions_path` according to where you cloned or extracted the repository. \n\n\n### Contributing\n\nSee [Contributing.md](https://github.com/maxgalbu/nightwatch-custom-commands-assertions/blob/master/Contributing.md).\n\n### List of commands\n\nSee [the docs folder](https://github.com/maxgalbu/nightwatch-custom-commands-assertions/blob/master/docs)\n'
