b'BareKit\n==========\n\n### [Visit website for full usage docs](http://trevanhetzel.github.io/barekit)\n\nBareKit is a front-end project starter meant to be a starting point and structural guide rather than a full framework. It\'s bare enough to not interfere with your custom styles or scripts, but yet has enough functioning modules to jumpstart a project in no time.\n\n_The project creator and lead for BareKit is [Trevan Hetzel](http://appendto.com/team/trevan-hetzel/) ([trevanhetzel](https://github.com/trevanhetzel)) . Use [Github issues](http://github.com/trevanhetzel/barekit) and pull requests or reach out to Trevan directly for support and contributions to BareKit._\n\n# Getting Started\n\nThe best way to get BareKit up and running on a project is to install via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You shouldn\'t ever touch the source anyway, so with Bower it\'s easy to get the latest updates.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Bower installed. Then you can add this line to a `bower.json` file `"barekit": "~0.7.0"` or simply do a `bower install barekit`.\n\n\n### JavaScript\n\nGetting up and running with the BareKit JavaScript modules is very simple. You first need to reference the latest jQuery file (also installable via Bower), and then reference the `barekit.min.js` file at the bottom of your HTML page (before the closing body tag).\n\nIf you installed jQuery and BareKit using Bower, the paths would look something like this:\n\n```\n<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js">\n<script src="bower_components/barekit/js/barekit.min.js">\n```\n\n### CSS\n\nThe BareKit CSS can be used in a few different ways. The core code comes with both a Sass and Stylus version, so the ideal way is to `@import` the barekit.scss or barekit.styl file from your main Sass or Stylus stylesheet.\n\nAgain, if you installed via Bower, the `@import` rule would look something like this:\n\n```\n// Import BareKit\n@import "bower_components/barekit/css/barekit";\n```\n\nUsing BareKit in this way allows you to compile it using your own preferred pre-processor, task runner, compression style, etc.\n\nThe other way to use the BareKit CSS is, of course, to just reference it directly in your markup.\n\n```\n<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/barekit/css/barekit.css">\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nFor details on using BareKit, visit the website at [trevanhetzel.github.io/barekit](http://trevanhetzel.github.io/barekit)'
