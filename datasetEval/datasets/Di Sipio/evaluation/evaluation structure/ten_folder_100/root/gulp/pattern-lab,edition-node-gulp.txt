b'![Pattern Lab Logo](/patternlab.png "Pattern Lab Logo")\n\n![current release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp.svg) ![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp.svg) [![Join the chat at Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/pattern-lab/node.svg)](https://gitter.im/pattern-lab/node)\n\n# Pattern Lab Node - Gulp Edition\n\nThe Gulp wrapper around [Pattern Lab Node Core](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node), the default PatternEngine, and supporting frontend assets.\n\n## Packaged Components\n\nThis Edition comes with the following components:\n\n* `pattern-lab/patternlab-node`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pattern-lab/patternlab-node)\n* `pattern-lab/patternengine-node-mustache`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-node-mustache) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pattern-lab/patternengine-node-mustache)\n* `pattern-lab/styleguidekit-assets-default`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-assets-default) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pattern-lab/styleguidekit-assets-default)\n* `pattern-lab/styleguidekit-mustache-default`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-mustache-default) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pattern-lab/styleguidekit-mustache-default)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis Edition uses [Node](https://nodejs.org) for core processing, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage project dependencies, and [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) to run tasks and interface with the core library. You can follow the directions for [installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on the Node website if you haven\'t done so already. Installation of Node will include npm.\n\n## Installing\n\nPattern Lab Node can be used different ways. Editions like this one are **example** pairings of Pattern Lab code and do not always have an upgrade path or simple means to run as a dependency within a larger project. Users wishing to be most current and have the greatest flexibility are encouraged to consume `patternlab-node` directly. Users wanting to learn more about Pattern Lab and have a tailored default experience are encouraged to start with an Edition. Both methods still expect to interact with other elements of the [Pattern Lab Ecosystem](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node#ecosystem).\n\nAs an Edition, the simplist installation sequence is to clone this repository.\n\n``` bash\nmkdir newApp && cd newApp\ngit clone https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp.git\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis edition comes pre-packaged with a couple simple gulp tasks. Extend them as needed.\n\n**build** patterns, copy assets, and construct ui\n\n``` bash\ngulp patternlab:build\n```\n\nbuild patterns, copy assets, and construct ui, watch source files, and **serve** locally\n\n``` bash\ngulp patternlab:serve\n```\n\nlogs Pattern Lab Node usage and **help** content\n\n``` bash\ngulp patternlab:help\n```\n\nTo interact further with Pattern Lab Node, such as to install plugins or starterkits, check out the rest of the `gulpfile.js`. You could also install the [Pattern Lab Node Command Line Interface](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node-cli) or learn more about the [core API](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node#usage).\n\n## Updating Pattern Lab\n\nTo update Pattern Lab please refer to each component\'s GitHub repository, and the [master instructions for core](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Upgrading). The components are listed at the top of the README.\n'
