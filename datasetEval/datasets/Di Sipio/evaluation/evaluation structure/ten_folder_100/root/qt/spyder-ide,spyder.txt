[More details](\nhttps://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Current-Funding-and-Development-Status)\n\n----\n\n## Overview\n\nSpyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python,\nand designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. It offers a\nunique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling\nfunctionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration,\ninteractive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization\ncapabilities of a scientific package.\n\nBeyond its many built-in features, its abilities can be extended even further\nvia its plugin system and API. Furthermore, Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5\nextension library, allowing you to build upon its functionality and embed\nits components, such as the interactive console, in your own software.\n\nFor more general information about Spyder and to stay up to date on the\nlatest Spyder news and information, please check out [our new website](\nhttps://www.spyder-ide.org/).\n\n\n## Core components\n\n* **Editor**\n\n    Work efficiently in a multi-language editor with a function/class browser,\n    real-time code analysis tools (`pyflakes`, `pylint`, and `pycodestyle`),\n    automatic code completion (`jedi` and `rope`),\n    horizontal/vertical splitting, and go-to-definition.\n\n* **Interactive console**\n\n    Harness the power of as many IPython consoles as you like with full\n    workspace and debugging support, all within the flexibility of a full\n    GUI interface. Instantly run your code by line, cell, or file,\n    and render plots right inline with the output or in interactive windows.\n\n* **Documentation viewer**\n\n    Render documentation in real-time with Sphinx for any class or function,\n    whether external or user-created, from either the Editor or a Console.\n\n* **Variable explorer**\n\n    Inspect any variables, functions or objects created during your session.\n    Editing and interaction is supported with many common types, including\n    numeric/strings/bools, Python lists/tuples/dictionaries, dates/timedeltas,\n    Numpy arrays, Pandas index/series/dataframes, PIL/Pillow images, and more.\n\n* **Development tools**\n\n    Examine your code with the static analyzer, trace its execution with the\n    interactive debugger, and unleash its performance with the profiler.\n    Keep things organized with project support and a builtin file explorer, and\n    use find in files to search across entire projects with full regex support.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can read the Spyder documentation online on [the Spyder Docs website](\nhttps://docs.spyder-ide.org/).\n\n\n## Installation\n\nFor a detailed guide to installing Spyder, please refer to our\n[installation instructions](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html).\n\nThe easiest way to install Spyder on any of our supported platforms\nis to download it as part of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)\ndistribution, and use the `conda` package and environment manager to keep it\nand your other packages installed and up to date.\n\nIf in doubt, you should always install Spyder via this method to avoid\nunexpected issues we are unable to help you with; it generally has the\nleast likelihood of potential pitfalls for non-experts, and we may be\nable to provide limited assistance if you do run into trouble.\n\nOther install options exist, including:\n\n* The [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/) distribution for Windows\n* The [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) project for macOS\n* Your distribution's package manager (i.e. `apt-get`, `yum`, etc) on Linux\n* The `pip` package manager, included with most Python installations\n\n**However**, we lack the resources to provide individual support for users who\ninstall via these methods, and they may be out of date or contain bugs outside\nour control, so we recommend the Anaconda version instead if you run into issues.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nBefore posting a report, *please* carefully read our **[Troubleshooting Guide](\nhttps://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide-and-FAQ)**\nand search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues)\nfor your error message and problem description, as the great majority of bugs\nare either duplicates, or can be fixed on the user side with a few easy steps.\nThanks!\n\n\n## Contributing and Credits\n\nSpyder was originally created by [Pierre Raybaut](\nhttps://github.com/PierreRaybaut), and is currently maintained by\n[Carlos C\xc3\xb3rdoba](https://github.com/ccordoba12) and an international\ncommunity of volunteers.\n\nYou can join us\xe2\x80\x94everyone is welcome to help with Spyder!\nPlease read our [contributing instructions](\nhttps://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nto get started!\n\nCertain source files are distributed under other compatible permissive licenses\nand/or originally by other authors.\nThe icons for the Spyder 3 theme are derived from [Font Awesome](\nhttps://fontawesome.com/) 4.7 (\xc2\xa9 2016 David Gandy; SIL OFL 1.1).\nMost Spyder 2 theme icons are sourced from the [Crystal Project icon set](\nhttps://www.everaldo.com) (\xc2\xa9 2006-2007 Everaldo Coelho; LGPL 2.1+).\nOther Spyder 2 icons are from [Yusuke Kamiyamane](\nhttp://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/) (\xc2\xa9 2013 Yusuke Kamiyamane; CC-BY 3.0),\nthe [FamFamFam Silk icon set](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/)\n(\xc2\xa9 2006 Mark James; CC-BY 2.5), and the [KDE Oxygen icons](\nhttps://www.kde.org/) (\xc2\xa9 2007 KDE Artists; LGPL 3.0+).\n\nSee [NOTICE.txt](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/NOTICE.txt)\nfor full legal information.\n\n\n## Running from a Github clone\n\nSpyder can be run directly from the source code, hosted on the\n[Spyder github repo](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder).\nYou may want to do this for fixing bugs in Spyder, adding new\nfeatures, learning how Spyder works or to try out development versions before\nthey are officially released.\n\nIf using `conda` (strongly recommended), this can be done by running the\nfollowing from the command line (the Anaconda Prompt, if on Windows):\n\n```bash\nconda install spyder\nconda remove spyder\ngit clone https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder.git\ncd spyder\npython bootstrap.py\n```\n\nYou also need to make sure the correct `spyder-kernels` version is installed\nfor the version of Spyder you are testing. The above procedure will give you\n`spyder-kernels` 0.x for the `3.x` branch (Spyder 3),\nso to run the `master` branch (Spyder 4) you need to additionally execute:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c spyder-ide spyder-kernels=1.*\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use `pip` to install PyQt5 and the other\n*runtime dependencies* listed below. However, beware:\nthis method is recommended for experts only, and you'll need to solve any\nproblems on your own.\n\nSee the [installation instructions](\nhttps://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html) for more details on all of this.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Important Note**: Most or all of the dependencies listed below come\nwith *Anaconda* and other scientific Python distributions, so you don't need\nto install them separately in those cases.\n\n### Build dependencies\n\nWhen installing Spyder from its source package, the only requirement is to have\na Python version equal or greater than 3.5 or 2.7.\n\n### Runtime dependencies\n\nThe basic dependencies to run Spyder are:\n\n* **Python** 3.5+ or 2.7: The core language Spyder is written in and for.\n* **PyQt5** 5.6+: Python bindings for Qt, used for Spyder's GUI.\n\nThe rest our dependencies (both required and optional) are declared in\n[this file](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/spyder/dependencies.py).\n\n\n## Sponsors\n\nSpyder is funded thanks to the generous support of\n\n\n[![Quansight](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/095d2c_2508c560e87d436ea00357abc404cf1d~mv2.png/v1/crop/x_0,y_9,w_915,h_329/fill/w_380,h_128,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/095d2c_2508c560e87d436ea00357abc404cf1d~mv2.png)](https://www.quansight.com/)[![Numfocus](https://i2.wp.com/numfocus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NumFocus_LRG.png?fit=320%2C148&ssl=1)](https://numfocus.org/)\n\n\nand the donations we have received from our users around the world through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/spyder/):\n\n[![Sponsors](https://opencollective.com/spyder/sponsors.svg)](https://opencollective.com/spyder#support)\n\n\n## More information\n\n[Main Website](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)\n\n[Download Spyder (with Anaconda)](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)\n\n[Online Documentation](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/)\n\n[Spyder Github](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder)\n\n[Troubleshooting Guide and FAQ](\nhttps://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide-and-FAQ)\n\n[Development Wiki](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Dev:-Index)\n\n[Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/spyder-ide/public)\n\n[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/spyderlib)\n\n[@Spyder_IDE on Twitter](https://twitter.com/spyder_ide)\n\n[@SpyderIDE on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SpyderIDE/)\n\n[Support Spyder on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/spyder/)\n"
