b'# ![Otter Browser logo](resources/icons/otter-browser-64.png) Otter Browser\n\n\n***A browser controlled by the user, not vice-versa***\n\n[**Otter Browser**](https://otter-browser.org/) aims to recreate the best aspects of **Opera 12** and to revive its spirit. We are focused on providing the powerful features power users want while keeping the browser fast and lightweight. We also learned from history and decided to release the browser under the GNU GPL v3.\n\n[![SourceForge](https://img.shields.io/sourceforge/dt/otter-browser.svg)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/otter-browser/files/)\n\n[![Screenshot](https://otter-browser.org/screenshots/1.png)](https://otter-browser.org/screenshots/)\n\nPlanned features are listed in the *TODO* file. Details on already implemented features are available in the *CHANGELOG* file. If you have an idea that has not yet been proposed or rejected, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/OtterBrowser/otter-browser/issues/new).\n\n## Install\n\nYou can either compile Otter Browser from source or use pre-compiled binaries.\n\n### From source\n\nTo build Otter Browser, you will need the following dependencies: **Qt 5.6.0** (or newer), **OpenSSL 1.0** (or newer), **GStreamer 1.0** (or newer) and codecs, and **CMake 3.1.0** (or newer). At the root of the directory where the source code is stored, execute these commands:\n\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n    cmake ../\n    make\n    make install\n\nDetailed instructions are available in the *INSTALL.md* file in the root of the repository.\n\n### Under Linux and *BSD\n\nLinux users can use the official AppImage version available on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/otter-browser/files/). It is a single executable file that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need any dependencies to be installed. The AppImage version should run under any system installed after 2012 provided it has OpenSSL 1.0.x (not 1.1.x) and GStreamer 1.x (with codecs). The browser is also available in the repositories of a wide range of Linux distributions and *BSD systems. Read more on [the dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/OtterBrowser/otter-browser/wiki/Packages).\n\n### Under Windows\n\nWindows users can download binary releases on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/otter-browser/files/).\n\n### Under macOS\n\nDMG packages are available on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/otter-browser/files/).\n\n## How to contribute\n\nOtter Browser is *your* browser. Because it is free software (GPL v3), you can contribute to make it better. New contributors are always welcome, whether you write code, create resources, report bugs, or suggest features.\n\nThe browser is written primarily in C++ and leverages powerful features offered by the Qt5 framework.\n\nWe also use JavaScript for interacting with rendering engines (when native APIs are not available) and Python 3 is our preferred language for creating tools to ease development.\n\nHave a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/OtterBrowser/otter-browser/issues) to find a mission that resonates with you.\n\nWe use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/otter-browser/otter-browser/) to translate Otter Browser.\n\nTo stay informed of Otter development, bug fixes and new features, you can join [the official forum](http://thedndsanctuary.eu/index.php?board=9.0). We also have two IRC channels on Freenode: [#otter-browser](http://irc.lc/freenode/otter-browser) (international) and [#otter-browser-pl](http://irc.lc/freenode/otter-browser-pl) (polski / Polish).\n\nRead *CONTRIBUTING.md* and don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate!\n'
