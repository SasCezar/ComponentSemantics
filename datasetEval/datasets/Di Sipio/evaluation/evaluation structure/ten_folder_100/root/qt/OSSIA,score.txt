Some are [five-minute fixes](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/blob/2e393a1786154c11d766e6c6476cc2bd5faa95d0/base/plugins/iscore-lib-process/Process/Style/ScenarioStyle.cpp#L3), other are [a multiple-day quest](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/blob/2e393a1786154c11d766e6c6476cc2bd5faa95d0/base/lib/core/plugin/PluginDependencyGraph.hpp#L67)\n* [**FIXME**](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/search?q=FIXME) : for critical bugs / problems.\n* [**MOVEME**](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/search?q=REMOVEME) : when something is not where it should be.\n* [**REMOVEME**](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/search?q=REMOVEME) : when something is redundant.\n* [**RENAMEME**](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/search?q=RENAMEME) : when the class does not match with the file it\'s in.\n* [**OPTIMIZEME**](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/search?q=OPTIMIZEME) : when an easy-to-write-but-suboptimal algorithm is used.\n\nFinally, one can write its own score plug-ins to add custom features to the software.\nAn example plug-in with the most common classes reimplemented is provided [here](https://github.com/OSSIA/iscore-addon-tutorial).\n'
