b'Gqrx\n====\n\nGqrx is an open source software defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented using\n[GNU Radio](http://gnuradio.org) and the [Qt GUI toolkit](https://www.qt.io/).\nCurrently it works on Linux and Mac with hardware supported by gr-osmosdr,\nincluding Funcube Dongle, RTL-SDR, Airspy, HackRF, BladeRF, RFSpace, USRP and\nSoapySDR.\n\nGqrx can operate as an AM/FM/SSB receiver with audio output or as an FFT-only\ninstrument. There are also various hooks for interacting with external\napplication using nertwork sockets.\n\n\nDownload\n--------\n\nGqrx is distributed as source code package and binaries for Linux and Mac.\nAlternate Mac support is available through macports and homebrew.\n\nPlease see http://gqrx.dk/download for a list of download resources.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nIt is strongly recommended to run the "volk_profile" gnuradio utility before\nrunning gqrx. This will detect and enable processor specific optimisations and\nwill in many cases give a significant performance boost.\n\nThe first time you start gqrx it will open a device configuration dialog.\nSupported devices that are connected to the computer are discovered\nautomatically and you can select any of them in the drop-down list.\n\nIf you don\'t see your device listed in the drop-down list it could be because:\n- The driver has not been included in a binary distribution\n- The udev rule has not been properly configured\n- Linux kernel driver is blocking access to the device\n\nYou can test your device using device specific tools, such as rtl_test,\nairspy_rx, hackrf_transfer, qthid, etc.\n\nGqrx supports multiple configurations and sessions if you have several devices\nor if you want to use the same device under different configurations. You can\nload a configuration from the GUI or using the -c command line argument. See\n"gqrx --help" for a complete list of command line arguments.\n\nTutorials and howtos are being written and published on the website\nhttp://gqrx.dk/\n\n\nKnown problems\n--------------\n\nSee the bug tracker on Github: https://github.com/csete/gqrx/issues\n\n\nGetting help and reporting bugs\n-------------------------------\n\nThere is a Google group for discussing anything related to Gqrx:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gqrx\nThis includes getting help with installation and troubleshooting. Please\nremember to provide detailed description of your problem, your setup, what\nsteps you followed, etc.\n\nPlease stick around and help others with their problems. Otherwise, if only\ndevelopers provide user support there will be no more time for further\ndevelopment.\n\n\nInstallation from source\n------------------------\n\nGqrx can be compiled using qmake or cmake.\n\nThe source code is hosted on Github: https://github.com/csete/gqrx\n\nTo compile gqrx from source you need the following dependencies:\n- GNU Radio 3.7 with the following components:\n    - gnuradio-runtime\n    - gnuradio-analog\n    - gnuradio-digital\n    - gnuradio-blocks\n    - gnuradio-filter\n    - gnuradio-fft\n    - gnuradio-audio\n    - gnuradio-pmt\n- The gr-iqbalance library (optional)\n- Drivers for the hardware you want to have support for:\n    - Funcube Dongle Pro driver via gr-fcd\n    - UHD driver via gr-uhd\n    - Funcube Dongle Pro+ driver from https://github.com/dl1ksv/gr-fcdproplus\n    - RTL-SDR driver from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/rtl-sdr/\n    - OsmoSDR driver from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/osmo-sdr/\n    - HackRF Jawbreaker driver from http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/\n    - Airspy driver from https://github.com/airspy/host\n    - SoapySDR from https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR\n    - RFSpace driver is bult in\n- gnuradio-osmosdr from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/gr-osmosdr/\n- pulseaudio or portaudio (Linux only and optional)\n- Qt 5 with the following components:\n    - Core\n    - GUI\n    - Network\n    - Widgets\n    - Svg (runtime only)\n- pkg-config\n- cmake version >= 3.2.0 if you wish to build using cmake.\n\nTo build using qmake, you can either open the gqrx.pro file in Qt Creator and\nbuild, or on the command line:\n<pre>\n$ git clone https://github.com/csete/gqrx.git gqrx.git\n$ cd gqrx.git\n$ mkdir build\n$ cd build\n$ qmake ..\n$ make\n</pre>\n\nUsing cmake, gqrx can be compiled from within Qt Creator or in a terminal:\n\nFor command line builds:\n<pre>\n$ git clone https://github.com/csete/gqrx.git gqrx.git\n$ cd gqrx.git\n$ mkdir build\n$ cd build\n$ cmake ..\n$ make\n</pre>\nOn some systems, the default cmake release builds are "over optimized" and\nperform poorly. In that case try forcing -O2 using\n<pre>\nexport CXXFLAGS=-O2\n</pre>\nbefore the cmake step.\n\nFor Qt Creator builds:\n<pre>\n$ git clone https://github.com/csete/gqrx.git gqrx.git\n$ cd gqrx.git\n$ mkdir build\nStart Qt Creator\nOpen gqrx.git/CMakeLists.txt file\nAt the dialog asking for build location, select gqrx.git/build\nclick continue\nIf asked to choose cmake executable, do so\nclick continue\nclick the run cmake button\nclick done\noptionally, on the Projects page, under Build Steps/Make/Additional arguments,\n\tenter -j4 (replacing 4 with the number of cores in your CPU).\nUse Qt Creator as before\n</pre>\n\nCredits and License\n-------------------\n\nGqrx is designed and written by Alexandru Csete OZ9AEC, and it is licensed\nunder the GNU General Public License.\n\nSome of the source files were adopted from Cutesdr by Moe Weatley and these\ncome with a Simplified BSD license.\n\nFollowing people and organisations have contributed to gqrx:\n\nAlex Grinkov\nAlexander Fasching\nAndy Sloane\nAndrea Merello\nAndrea Montefusco IW0HDV \nAnthony Willard\nBastian Bloessl\nPavel Stano\nChris Kuethe\nChristian Lindner DL2VCL\ncharlylima\nDarin Franklin\nStefano Leucci\nDaniil Cherednik\nDominic Chen\nElias \xc3\x96nal\nFrank Brickle, AB2KT\nBob McGwier, N4HY\nG\xc3\xb6ran Weinholt, SA6CJK\nGrigory Shipunov\nJi\xc5\x99\xc3\xad Pinkava\nJeff Long\nJosh Blum\nKate Adams\nKitware Inc.\nMichael Dickens\nMichael Lass\nMichael Tatarinov\nMoe Weatley\nNadeem Hasan\nNokia\nPhil Vachon\nRob Frohne\nStefano Leucci\nTimothy Reaves\nValentin Ochs\nVesa Solonen\nVincent Pelletier\nWill Scales\nWolfgang Fritz DK7OB\nYoussef Touil\n\nSome of the icons are from:\n- The GNOME icon theme CC-SA 3.0 by GNOME icon artists \n- Tango icon theme, Public Domain by The people from the Tango! project\n- Mint-X icon theme, GPL by Clement Lefebvre\n\nAlso thanks to Volker Schroer and Alexey Bazhin for bringing Funcube Dongle\nPro+ support to GNU Radio and Gqrx.\n\nLet me know if somebody is missing from the list.\n\nAlex OZ9AEC\n'
