b'# Hidviz\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ondrejbudai/hidviz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ondrejbudai/hidviz)\n[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/8v04qku72xc7sh4t/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ondrejbudai/hidviz/branch/master)\n\nHidviz is a GUI application for in-depth analysis of USB HID class devices. The 2 main usecases of this application are reverse-engineering existing devices and developing new USB HID devices.\n\n*USB HID class consists of many possible devices, e.g. mice, keyboards,\njoysticks and gamepads. But that\'s not all! There are more exotic HID devices, e.g. weather stations, medical equipment\n(thermometers, blood pressure monitors) or even simulation devices (think of flight sticks!).*\n\n![Hidviz screenshot](https://github.com/ondrejbudai/hidviz/blob/master/media/screenshot.png?raw=true)\n\n## 1) Building\n\nHidviz can be built on various platforms where following prerequisities can be obtained. Currently only Fedora, Ubuntu and MSYS2/Windows are supported and build guide is available for them.\n\n### 1.1) Prerequisities\n- C++ compiler with C++14 support\n- libusb 1.0 (can be called libusbx in you distro)\n- protobuf (v2 is enough)\n- Qt5 base\n- CMake (>=3.2)\n\n#### 1.1.1) Installing prerequisities on Fedora\n```\nsudo dnf install gcc-c++ gcc qt5-qtbase-devel protobuf-devel libusbx-devel\n```\n\n#### 1.1.2) Installing prerequisities on Ubuntu\n```\nsudo apt-get install build-essential qtbase5-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libusb-1.0-0-dev\n```\n*Note that Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has old gcc unable to build hidviz, you need to install at least [gcc 5](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-toolchain-r).*\n\n#### 1.1.3) Installing prerequisities on MSYS2/Windows\n*Please note hidviz is primarily developed on Linux and we currently don\'t have Windows CI therefore Windows build can be broken at any time. If you find so, please create an issue.*\n\nIf you do not have MSYS2 installed, firstly follow this [guide](https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki/MSYS2-installation) to install MSYS2.\n\n```\npacman -S git mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5 mingw-w64-x86_64-libusb \\\n          mingw-w64-x86_64-protobuf mingw-w64-x86_64-protobuf-c mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain \\\n          make\n```\n\n### 1.2) Clone and prepare out of source build\nFirstly you need to obtain sources from git and prepare directory for out of source build:\n```\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/ondrejbudai/hidviz.git\nmkdir hidviz/build\ncd hidviz/build\n```\n**Please note you have to do recursive clone.**\n### 1.3) Configuring\n#### 1.2.1) Configuring on Fedora/Ubuntu (Linux)\n```\ncmake ..\n```\n#### 1.2.2) Configuring on MSYS2/Windows\n```\ncmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..\n```\n### 1.4) Build\n```\nmake -j$(nproc)\n```\n\n*If you are doing MSYS2 build, check before build you are using MinGW32/64 shell, otherwise the build process won\'t work. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki/MSYS2-introduction).*\n\n## 2) Running\n**To run this project you need `build/hidviz` as you current directory for hidviz to work properly!**\n\nAfter successful build you need to run\n\n```\ncd hidviz\n./hidviz\n```\n\n### 2.1) Running on Windows\nUnfortunately you cannot use hidviz on Windows straight out of the box. Firstly you need to install custom drivers to devices you want to analyze.\n\nI recommend you using following approach: Download [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/), run it and install libusbK to device you want to analyze. You can find more information about the need for custom driver on Windows on [libusb wiki](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/wiki/Windows#how-to-use-libusb-on-windows).\n\n## 3) Installing (Linux only)\n\n```\nsudo make install\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can install [`hidviz`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hidviz/) from Arch Linux\'s AUR repository:\n\n```\npacaur -S hidviz\n```\n\n## 4) License\nHidviz is license under GPLv3+.
