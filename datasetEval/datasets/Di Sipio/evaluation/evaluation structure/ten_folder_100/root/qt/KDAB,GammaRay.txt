This works both locally on your\nworkstation and remotely on an embedded target.\n\nAugmenting your instruction-level debugger, GammaRay allows you to work on a\nmuch higher level, with the same concepts as the frameworks you use. This is\nespecially useful for the more complex Qt frameworks such as model/view, state\nmachines or scene graphs.\n\nAmong other things GammaRay can:\n\n * Browse the QObject tree with live updates.\n * View and edit object properties.\n * View and invoke slots of a QObject, and monitor its signals.\n * List all QObject inbound and outbound signal/slot connections.\n * Provide a layout information overlay for QWidget and QtQuick2 applications.\n * Inspect all QPainter operations used to draw a specific widget.\n * Browse the QtQuick2 item tree and scenegraph.\n * Inspect shaders and geometry data of QtQuick2 items.\n * Plot object lifetime and emitted signals.\n * Browse the QAbstractProxyModel hierarchy and inspect intermediate\n   results in a proxy model chain.\n * Visual live inspection of QStateMachines.\n * Browse the item tree of any QGraphicsView scene.\n * Show a live preview of QGraphicsView items, including showing their coordinate system,\n   transformation origin, rotate/zoom/pan, etc.\n * Intercept translations and change them at runtime.\n * Inspect all building blocks of a QStyle.\n * Show all QTimers and their statistics (number of wakeups, wakeup time, ...)\n * Browse all QTextDocuments, along with the ability to edit them and view\n   their internal structures.\n * Act as a complete java script debugger, attachable to any QScriptEngine\n  (including the usually not accessible one used by QtQuick1 internally).\n * Perform HTML/CSS/DOM/JS introspection/editing/profiling on any QWebPage,\n   thanks to QWebInspector.\n * Browse the QResource tree and its content.\n * Show all registered meta types.\n * Show all installed fonts.\n * Show all available codecs.\n\nContact\n=======\n* Feel free to visit us on IRC: Channel is #gammaray on Freenode (irc://irc.freenode.net/gammaray)\n* Or send mail to our mailing list: https://mail.kdab.com/mailman/listinfo/gammaray-interest\n\nGet Involved\n============\nIf you want to contribute, please check out: https://github.com/KDAB/GammaRay/wiki/Get-Involved\n\nKDAB will happily accept external contributions, but substantial\ncontributions will require a signed Copyright Assignment Agreement\nsee docs/GammaRay-CopyrightAssignmentForm.docx).\n\nContact info@kdab.com for more information.\n\nPlease submit your contributions or issue reports from our GitHub space at\nhttps://github.com/KDAB/GammaRay\n\nLicense\n=======\nThe GammaRay Software is (C) 2010-2019 Klar\xc3\xa4lvdalens Datakonsult AB (KDAB),\nand is available under the terms of the GPL version 2 (or any later version,\nat your option).
