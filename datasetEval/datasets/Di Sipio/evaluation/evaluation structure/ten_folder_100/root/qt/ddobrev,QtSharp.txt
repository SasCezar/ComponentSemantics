For new code and binary releases please visit https://gitlab.com/ddobrev/QtSharp.\n=======\n\n\nQtSharp\n=======\n\nMono/.NET bindings for Qt\n\nThis project aims to create Mono/.NET libraries that wrap Qt (https://qt-project.org/) thus enabling its usage through C#.\nIt relies on the excellent CppSharp (https://github.com/mono/CppSharp).\nIt is a generator that expects the include and library directories of a Qt set-up and then generates and compiles the wrappers.\nWhile still in development, it should work with any Qt version when complete.\nThere is no Qt included in the repository, users have to download and install Qt themselves.\nFor now, Qt MinGW for Windows has been the only tested version.\nQt for OS X and Linux are planned, Qt for VC++ has not been planned for now.\n\nThe source code is separated into a library that contains the settings and passes the generator needs, and a command-line client.\nIn the future a GUI client, constructed with Qt# itself, is planned as well.\n\nThe are binary releases for Windows and Qt MinGW at https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp/releases. They are in an alpha stage.\nAs they get more stable, binaries for other operating systems will be added as well.\n\n## Getting started\n\nYou need to deploy Qt itself by following http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html#application-dependencies .\nIn addition, for each Qt module you use you also need Qt<module>-inlines.dll deployed alongside your executable.\nYou can use QtSharp with any C# IDE, including Visual Studio, but make sure your executable is 32-bit by either using the\nx86 configuration or AnyCPU with "Prefer 32-bit" checked.\n\n## Examples\n\nYou can find examples at https://github.com/dsoronda/QtSharpDemos and https://github.com/grbd/QtSharp.TestApps .\nThanks to https://github.com/dsoronda and https://github.com/grbd.\n\n## Documentation\n\n1.

[Running - NUnit Tests](https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp/blob/master/Docs/3.%20Running%20-%20NUnit%20Tests.md)\n4. [Building - CppSharp](https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp/blob/master/Docs/4.%20Building%20-%20CppSharp.md)\n\n## Coverage\n\nQtSharp has been tested only with Qt for MinGW, and with Qt\'s built-in MinGW set-up, so far.\n\n## Funding\n\nIn order to speed up the development of the project, I\'ve been looking for funding.\nThere are 2 ways for that. The first one is sponsoring Qt# itself.\nThe second way would be paid assignments related to CppSharp - for example bindings for other C++ libraries.\nEither way is going to immensely benefit Qt#.\n'
