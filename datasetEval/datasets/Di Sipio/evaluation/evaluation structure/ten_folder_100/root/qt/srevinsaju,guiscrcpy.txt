[Future Releases](#future-releases)\n7. [Support](#support-me)\n8. [Changelog](#changelog)\n\n\n\n## Installation\n[(skip)](#Features)\n\n`guiscrcpy` can be installed through source code (recommended) or by downloading the release binary (Windows, Linux ~ Nightly Builds).\n(Also called Step 0). Put a star on my repo. Gives support to #opensource and me!!\n\n\n### Installing from pip\nIt is the easiest way of installing guiscrcpy.\nJust use `pip install guiscrcpy`\nReplace `pip` with `pip3` if `python3` is not your default version.\n\n### Building from source\nIt is always recommended to run guiscrcpy from source due to its flexibility and fast I/O speeds. Thanks to Python\'s interpreter technology, commands are executed faster than ever. The procedure to install guiscrcpy from source is same for all platform or OSes which support python3.\n\n\n1. Clone the guiscrcpy GitHub repository.\nIf you have `git` installed, you may run this:\n`git clone https://github.com/srevinsaju/guiscrcpy`\n\n\nIf you do not have `git` installed on your system, you may click the drop down menu from `Clone this repository > Download Zip` or [click here.](https://github.com/srevinsaju/guiscrcpy/archive/master.zip)\n\n2. Extract the files to a directory\n\n3. Linux users have a shortcut to do the installation process. Just run `./guiscrcpy-src-installer.sh`. It might ask for sudo password to install it to the application menu. You may either deny it or accept it or edit the script file to match your needs. If the script completes successfully, you might be able to run  `guiscrcpy` from any directory, and see a Desktop launcher from your Appplication Launcher. You may skip step 4. guiscrcpy is ready to use!\n\n4. On Windows, MacOS or Linux, where you didn\'t run step 3, you should install the dependencies. The dependencies are provided in the requirements.txt file. It is easier to install with\n`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`\nUse the --user flag to keep the modules limited to the user account.\nAlternatively, you can perform\n`python3 -m pip install PyQt5 psutil qdarkstyle`\nA dependency that is optional is `pystray`, which is meant for developers only.\n\n5. Fire up guiscrcpy with this terminal command on\n\n    * **Linux**:\n`guiscrcpy` or click the `guiscrcpy icon` on your desktop launcher!\n    * **Windows**: `python3 guiscrcpy`\n\n\n\n**NOTE**:\n\n(i) Do not use Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Z to stop the program as it might run into an unresponsive window. Alternatively, use the close button on the panels.\n\n(ii) Before running from source, make sure you have `scrcpy` on your path. You can Google it out, on how to do it. The Windows binary packages `scrcpy` binaries along with it. Using `guiscrcpy-src-installer.sh` also does not require you to consult   `scrcpy` on path\n\n\n### Installing from Binary\n#### Windows   <img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Windows_logo_-_2012.svg/200px-Windows_logo_-_2012.svg.png height=16px>  \nFor Windows, the executable is compiled into an Installer. Download the Portable file from GitHub or Mega, given in the [Downloads section](#Downloads).\n\nYou may want to add `guiscrcpy` to the Start Menu, using `Pin to Start` button on Windows Explorer Panel.\n#### Linux  <img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Tux.png height=16px>\nFor Linux, download the latest official `guiscrcpy_linux-*` release from GitHub or Mega on [Downloads section](#Downloads), double click the file, and you are good to go.\nAs pre-requisite, you should do `sudo snap install scrcpy` to install the scrcpy engine.\n\nFor Arch Linux and derived OSes, a __third-party maintainer__ has released a `guiscrcpy-AUR` and `guiscrcpy-git`.\nSee [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/guiscrcpy/)\n\n\n\n### MacOS\nUnfortunately, I do not own a Mac device, and hence cant compile for one, but it is easy to build one. Read the [build instruction](#Build)\n\n\n## Features\n`guiscrcpy` has many features which is very much required for day to day usage for app developers, common users, students, commerce departments, testers, production managers and helpline centres. Its powerful side panels, bottom panels and floating console makes using almost a touch controlled Android device, completely comprehensive on a Desktop, laptop or a `multitouch` Tablet.\n\n\n`guiscrcpy` uses USB or WiFi for screen mirroring. In comparison to other android screen mirroring software, `guiscrcpy` uses as less as `6 MiB` on a RAM*, and has high definition screen quality and latency through USB, more than 16MB/s quality. Using WiFi reduces\n\n### **Aim**\n\nIt focuses on:\n* lightness (native, displays only the device screen)\n* performance (30~60fps)\n* quality (1920\xc3\x971080 or above)\n* low latency (35~70ms)\n* low startup time (~1 second to display the first image)\n* non-intrusiveness (nothing is left installed on the device)\n   > ~ from [scrcpy README](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)\n\nguiscrcpy focuses on:\n* independent add on controls\n* faster execution (no need to waste time to think; oh, what was the command for changing bitrate, etc.)\n* configuration writing\n* one handed controls\n* easy GUI\n\n### **Requirements** : *What you need for `guiscrcpy`*\nAll the requirements are the same as that of `scrcpy`. A copy of the requirements are given below.\n\nThe Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).\n\nMake sure you [enabled adb debugging][enable-adb] on your device(s).\n\n[enable-adb]: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#Enabling\n\nOn some devices, you also need to enable [an additional option][control] to\ncontrol it using keyboard and mouse.\n\n[control]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/70#issuecomment-373286323\n\n\n### **Comparison**: *Why `guiscrcpy` is better*\n\n| Feature       | `guiscrcpy`   | other `*scrcpy*` alternatives  | commercial software   |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- |\n| Speed         | Faster, as it is independent from scrcpy engine  | Mostly integrated into the engine, making a GUI layer (slower)| Contains Ads or is through Internet, (data charges are inclusive) |\n| Language | Python  | C-alternatives | Binary (unknown) |\n| Type | Open source (you can edit them) | Open source | Proprietary |\n| Other | Can write configuration file and handle events like swipe up, swipe down, App-switch, volume up | Can handle all events which is using a forked version of scrcpy | Can do everything except swipes and pinches |\n| Compatibility (PC) | Windows 7 (32/64) / MacOS / Linux   |  Windows 7 (32/64) / MacOS / Linux   | Windows 7 (32/64) / MacOS / Linux  |\n| Compatibility (Mobile) | Android 5.0+ (given by scrcpy)| Android 5.0+ | Android 4.4+ |\n| Base | scrcpy (original, created by @rom1v | forked scrcpy | no scrcpy |\n| Keyboard Shortcuts | All the shortcuts which are mentioned by scrcpy | Unknown | Unknown |\n\n\n### Connecting *Wirelessly*\n\n_guiscrcpy_ uses `adb` to communicate with the device, and `adb` can [connect] to a\ndevice over TCP/IP:\n\n1. Connect the device to the same Wi-Fi as your computer.\n2. Get your device IP address (in Settings \xe2\x86\x92 About phone \xe2\x86\x92 Status).\n3. Open a Command Prompt window in `C:\\Program Files\\guiscrcpy\\` . (needed for only wireless connection)\n3. Enable adb over TCP/IP on your device: Type this command `adb tcpip 5555`.\n4. Unplug your device.\n5. Connect to your device: Type this command: `adb connect DEVICE_IP:5555` _(replace `DEVICE_IP`)_.\n6. Run `guiscrcpy` as usual.\n\nIt may be useful to decrease the bit-rate and the definition:\n[connect]: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#wireless\n\n> ~ Quoted from scrcpy.\n\n### Contents\nThe package includes four parts:\n\n#### Main UI controller\n![Main Window](/docs/images/main.png)\n\nIt handles all the pre - runtime features and gives flags to the `scrcpy` engine. It also includes a configuration writing system, which write the configuration file to the home directory, so `guiscrcpy` can read the information and run it, without\ngiving flags quite often.\n\n\n#### Toolkit UI controller\n<img src=/docs/images/toolkit.png>\n\nThe `toolkit` is an independent module, which is in\nneither way connected to `scrcpy` or `guiscrcpy`, except for launching.\n> NOTE: See [Issues: Unable to drag panel](#Issues)\n\n#### Bottom Panel controller\n![Bottom Panel](/docs/images/bottompanel.png)\n\nThe `bottom_panel` is an additional floating windows\nthat helps to do basic controlling like **Home Key, Back Key, Power Key**. This include the most important functions, one would like to do with an Android device.\nThe most important feature of this module, is that **it has no interference with the `scrcpy` SDL layer, and hence maximum speed**\n> NOTE: See [Issues: Unable to drag panel](#Issues)\n\n#### SwipeUX panel\nThe `guiscrcpy v1.11 ` features a Swipe panel. Controlling a multitouch device like Android devices can be limited with a mouse. To enhance this efficiency, a SwipeUX Panel is added to do common swipes on all four directions\n\n![Swipe Panel](docs/images/swipeux.png)\n\n\n##### scrcpy engine\nThe scrcpy engine, is the classic v1.10 scrcpy, found on [scrcpy\'s github page by @rom1v](https://github.com/genymobile/scrcpy). On Windows release files, scrcpy, binary executable is also attached to make `PATH` problems easier to solve. On Linux, scrcpy has to be manually downloaded from `snap`. The installation script does it automatically for you.\n\n\n### Keyboard shortcuts\nguiscrcpy includes all the shortcuts that scrcpy packages.\nThese are all the [keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#shortcuts)\n\n\n## Why guiscrcpy?\n\nI have Python as a subject for Class XI, so as a part of it\'s advanced learning experience,\nand because of my daily use of scrcpy, wanted to integrate GUI into the CLIbased app!!\n**GUI** stands for Graphical User Interface, and **Py** is not inherited from scrc<b>py</b> but rather from <b>Py</b> for Python\n\n## Manual Building\n\n### Dependencies (for developers)\n* `PyQt5`\n* `psutil`\n* `qdarkstyle`\n* `pystray` (optional, developers)\n* `PyAutoGui` (optional, developers, Windows only)\n\n\n### Manual Building\n1. (Also called Step 0). Put a star on my repo. Gives support to #opensource!!\n2. Install python3. If you don\'t have it install it from\n[Python Software Website](https://python.org) or on Linux by <p>`sudo apt install python3.7`\n\n3. Clone my git repo. or copy paste this to your _bash_ <p>`git clone https://github.com/srevinsaju/guiscrcpy`\n\n4. Run the Python Package installer `pip` and run the commands below <p> `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` <p>\n5. So you are all set! Run the program by <p> `python3 guiscrcpy`\n\n7. Read [Known Issues](#Issues) if you fall into some errors.\n\n\n## Future Releases\nSurely, guiscrcpy has great scope of improvement.\nCompared to paid Screen Mirroring software, scrcpy gives\na lot of advantages, but my future plans are as follows\n* ~~Fix HOME_key, BACK_key. (Will have to wait until @rom1v examines my work)~~ Fixed!\n* ~~Add better UI support with adb functions out of scrcpy~~ Fixed again!\n* Support python3.8.\n* Add service running indicator\n* ~~Create pre-built installer and files, Will try fbs build system, after a quite while~~ Fixed!\n\n\n\n## Issues\n### Linux (X Server)\nFor Linux operating systems, if python raises `Xlib>>ModuleNotFoundError`, then run <p>\n`sudo apt install python3-xlib` <p>\n`sudo apt install python3-qt5`\n\nTo use toolkit (development, on Linux only), run: <p>\n`sudo apt install wmctrl xdotool`\n\n### Some buttons not working\nSome buttons like `clipboard`, `pinch in/out` are not enabled. But, however, you may enable it by recompiling the source code. I am looking forward for pinching on Android help / Documentation / links.\n\n### Unable to drag Panel or Toolkit\n[According to Issue #4](https://github.com/srevinsaju/guiscrcpy/issues/4#) created by [@logix2](https://github.com/logix2), regarding some problems in dragging panels in the Linux OS, in this case, using the `Meta`, `Super` or `Alt` keys, to use the Desktop Window Manager functionality in moving the Panel.\n\n\n## Support me!\nSponsor me or share your ideas, issues with me on github and email [srevin03@gmail.com](srevin03@gmail.com)!!\n\n\n## Developers\n`guiscrcpy`, on initializing, creates a guiscrcpy.cfg file in\n* Windows: `C:\\Users\\<UserName>\\AppData\\guiscrcpy.cfg`\n* Linux: `~/.config/guiscrcpy.cfg`\n* Mac and other OSes: `~/guiscrcpy.cfg`\n\nA user may create backups of configuration file, or edit them manually. It is created by guiscrcpy and stored in the respective\ndirectories.\nThe structure of the .cfg file is not based on structured language, but based on backslash n (new line) in LF and CRLF file type\nThe structure is as given below\n\nthe cfg file struct::\n*        :bitrate0 [Line 4]\n*        :dimension0 [Line 5]\n*        :swtouches0 [Line 6]\n*        :fullscreen0 [Line 7]\n*        :dispRO0 [Line 8]\n\nThe Line Numbers are based on Python\'s index numbers, whuch starts from 0 and ends in 8, in this case.\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks to all of the developers, testers, friends and family who helped me in this project.\n\nSpecial thanks to\n* @logix2 - Issue #5, #7\n* @Strubbl - Issue #8\n* Panel icons (home, back, bell, etc. located in `\\icons\\*`) made by Dave Gandy from www.flaticon.com\nused under Creative Commons 3.0 Unported.\nThe original SVG black work by Dave Gandy has ben re-oriented, flipped or color-changed.\nThe rest of Terms and Conditions put formward by CC-3.0:Unported has been feverently followed\nby the developer. Icons have been adapeted in all the three windows.\n\n\n## Changelog\n### Build 1.11.0\n* Added `guiscrcpy-src-installer.sh` which installs guiscrcpy to your path and creates a desktop launcher\n* Added Swipe UX Windows\n\n\n### Build 1.10.0\n\n#### Highlights\n\n##### New logo for guiscrcpy\nThe new logo for `guiscrcpy` has been deployed, licensed under *Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0*. A comparison between old and new. <p>\n <img src="guiscrcpy/ui/guiscrcpy_logo.png"  width=49%>\n##### New UI and distributed controls\nThe new UI aims for faster ergonomics and consumer oriented. Individual modules, now are separate from scrcpy executable to provide speed to the mirroring system. The new UI also looks way better than the old one ;) <p>\n<img src="/screen.png" width=100%> **OLD**\n<img src="screen2.png"  width=100%>\n**NEW**\n\n#### Raw\n* Fixed many bugs\n* Better UI, based on Material principles\n* Switched to dark theme, thanks to  `qdarkstyle`\n* Faster `scrcpy` loading.
