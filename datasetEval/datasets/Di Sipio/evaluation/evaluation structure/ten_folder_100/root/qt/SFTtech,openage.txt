b'[![openage](/assets/logo/banner.png)](http://openage.sft.mx)\n============================================================\n\n**openage**: a volunteer project to create a free engine clone of the *Genie Engine* used by *Age of Empires*, *Age of Empires II (HD)* and *Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds*, comparable to projects like [OpenMW](https://openmw.org/), [OpenRA](http://openra.net/),  [OpenSAGE](https://github.com/OpenSAGE/OpenSAGE/), [OpenTTD](https://openttd.org/) and [OpenRCT2](https://openrct2.org/). At the moment we focus our efforts on the integration of *Age of Empires II*, while being primarily aimed at POSIX platforms such as **GNU/Linux**.\n\nopenage uses the original game assets (such as sounds and graphics), but (for obvious reasons) doesn\'t ship them.\nTo play, you require *an original AoE II: TC or [AoE II: HD](http://store.steampowered.com/app/221380/)* installation\n(via [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) or [Steam-Linux](doc/media_convert.md#how-to-use-the-original-game-assets)).\n\n[![github stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/SFTtech/openage.svg)](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/stargazers)\n[![#sfttech on Freenode](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20freenode-brightgreen)](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sfttech)\n[![#sfttech on matrix.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/matrix-%23sfttech-blue.svg)](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#sfttech:matrix.org)\n[![quality badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/cuteness-overload-orange.svg)](http://www.emergencykitten.com/)\n\n\n\nContact\n-------\nContact  | Where?\n---------|-------\nIssue Tracker | [SFTtech/openage](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues)\nDevelopment Blog | [blog.openage.sft.mx](https://blog.openage.sft.mx)\nForum | [<img src="https://www.redditstatic.com/about/assets/reddit-logo.png" alt="reddit" height="22"/> /r/openage](https://www.reddit.com/r/openage/)\nMatrix Chat | [`#sfttech:matrix.org`](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#sfttech:matrix.org)\nIRC Chat | [`irc.freenode.net #sfttech`](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sfttech)\nMoney Sink | [![money sink](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/SFTtech)\n\n\nTechnical foundation\n--------------------\n\nTechnology     | Component\n---------------|----------\n**C++17**      | Engine core\n**Python3**    | Scripting, media conversion, in-game console, code generation\n**Qt5**        | Graphical user interface\n**Cython**     | Glue code\n**CMake**      | Build system\n**OpenGL3.3**  | Rendering, shaders\n**SDL2**       | Cross-platform Audio/Input/Window handling\n**Opus**       | Audio codec\n[**nyan**](https://github.com/SFTtech/nyan) | Content Configuration and Modding\n**Humans**     | Mixing together all of the above\n\n\nGoals\n-----\n\n* Fully authentic look and feel\n  * This can only be approximated, since the behaviour of the original game is mostly undocumented,\n    and guessing/experimenting can only get you this close\n  * We will not implement useless artificial limitations (max 30 selectable units...)\n* Multiplayer (obviously)\n* Matchmaking and ranking with a [haskell masterserver](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-masterserver)\n* Optionally, [improvements](/doc/ideas/) over the original game\n* AI scripting in Python, you can use [machine learning](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n  * here is some [additional literature](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)\n* Re-creating [free game assets](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-data)\n* An easily-moddable content format: [**nyan** yet another notation](https://github.com/SFTtech/nyan)\n* An integrated Python console and API, comparable to [blender](https://www.blender.org/)\n* Awesome infrastructure such as our own [Kevin CI service](https://github.com/SFTtech/kevin)\n\nBut beware, for sanity reasons:\n\n* No network compatibility with the original game.\n  You really wanna have the same problems again?\n* No binary compatibility with the original game.\n  A one-way script to convert maps/savegames/missions to openage is planned though.\n\n\nCurrent State of the Project\n----------------------------\n\n - What features are currently implemented?\n   - See [doc/status.md](/doc/status.md).\n\n - What\'s the plan?\n   - See [doc/milestones.md](/doc/milestones.md). We also have [lists of crazy xor good ideas](/doc/ideas) and a [technical overview for requested features](/doc/ideas/fr_technical_overview.md). \n\n\nInstallation Packages\n---------------------\n\n**Supported Platforms:** Linux, Windows 10, MacOS X 10.14\n \n  - For **Linux** check at [repology](https://repology.org/project/openage/versions) if your distribution has any packages available or [here](https://bintray.com/simonsan/openage-packages/openage-linux-releases) for any future updates on *.deb and AppImage packages.\n  - For **Windows** check our [release page](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/releases) for the latest installer or [here](https://dl.bintray.com/simonsan/openage-packages/) for nightly builds.\n\n    __NOTE:__ If you have any problems starting conversion or starting *openage* take a look into the [package instructions](doc/build_instructions/packages.md) and our [troubleshooting guide](/doc/troubleshooting.md).\n\n    __NOTE:__ For **MacOSX** we currently don\'t have any packages.\n\n\nDependencies, Building and Running\n----------------------------------\n\n  Operating System    | Build status\n  :------------------:|:--------------:\n  Debian Sid          | [Todo: Kevin #11](https://github.com/SFTtech/kevin/issues/11)\n  MacOSX 10.14        | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SFTtech/openage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SFTtech/openage)\n  Windows 10 - x64    | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/66sx35key94u740e?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/simonsan/openage-sl215)\n\n\n - How do I get this to run on my box?\n   - See [doc/building.md](/doc/building.md).\n\n - I compiled everything. Now how do I run it?\n   - Execute `./run`.\n   * [The convert script](/doc/media_convert.md) will transform original assets into openage formats, which are a lot saner and more moddable.\n   - Use your brain and react to the things you\'ll see.\n\n - Waaaaaah! It\n   - segfaults\n   - prints error messages I don\'t want to read\n   - ate my dog\n\nAll of those are features, not bugs.\n\nTo turn them off, use `./run --dont-segfault --no-errors --dont-eat-dog`.\n\n\nIf this still does not help, try our [troubleshooting guide](/doc/troubleshooting.md), the [contact section](#contact)\nor the [bug tracker](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues).\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\n* Being typical computer science students, we hate people.\n* Please don\'t contact us.\n* Nobody likes Age of Empires anyway.\n* None of you are interested in making openage more awesome anyway.\n* We don\'t want a community.\n* Don\'t even think about trying to help.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n* No **bug reports** or **feature requests**, the game is perfect as is.\n* Don\'t try to **fix any bugs**, see above.\n* Don\'t implement any features, your code is crap.\n* Don\'t even think about sending a **pull request**.\n* Please ignore the [easy tasks](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that [could just be done](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22just+do+it%22).\n* Absolutely never ever participate in this [boring community](https://www.reddit.com/r/openage/).\n* Don\'t note the irony, you idiot.\n\nTo prevent accidental violation of one of those guidelines, you should *never*\n\n* [learn git](https://git-scm.com/book/)\n* [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)\n* [learn python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html)\n* [learn c++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)\n* read the code and documentation\n* [contribute](/doc/contributing.md) anything to the code\n* [contact us](#contact)\n\nCheers, happy hecking.\n\n\nDevelopment Process\n-------------------\n\nWhat does openage development look like in practice?\n - extensive [synchronization](#contact)!\n - [doc/development.md](/doc/development.md).\n\nCan I help?\n - [doc/contributing.md](/doc/contributing.md).\n\nAll documentation is also in this repo:\n\n- Code documentation is embedded in the sources for Doxygen (see [doc readme](/doc/README.md)).\n- Have a look at the [doc directory](/doc/). This folder tends to get outdated when code changes.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n**GNU GPLv3** or later; see [copying.md](copying.md) and [legal/GPLv3](/legal/GPLv3).\n\nI know that probably nobody is ever gonna look at the `copying.md` file,\nbut if you want to contribute code to openage, please take the time to\nskim through it and add yourself to the authors list.\n'
