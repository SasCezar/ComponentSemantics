Passengers pay with cash and get connected with drivers directly, where LibreTaxi is a thin layer allowing to negotiate the price before order is confirmed. No registration/approval is required. Less regulations.\n\n* Demo available at [@libretaxi_bot](https://telegram.me/libretaxi_bot)\n* Also see [LibreTaxi FAQ](doc/FAQ.md)\n\n## Implementation details\n\nTechnical stack:\n\n* Node.js, JavaScript (ES6)\n* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as data storage\n* Redis as storage for [kue](https://github.com/Automattic/kue)\n* [Telegram](https://telegram.org) as the main transport\n* CLI as backup and PoC transport\n\nTranslatable via locale file. Currently has support of [20+ languages](src/validations/supported-locales.js).\n\nServer support: macOS, Linux (Windows should also work).\n\nClient (Telegram) support: iOS, Android, macOS desktop client, web (can also work for Windows phones - not tested).

However, web client can be used on these OS along with any modern browser.\n\n## Why Telegram?\n\n* Available for all popular platforms\n* Has rich bot API\n* Fast, reliable, and secure\n* Works perfect with slow/poor Internet connection\n* Staff and support are developer-friendly\n* More likely to fight for LibreTaxi rights when it comes to regulations (Germany/EU jurisdiction)\n\n## Technical roadmap (unordered)\n\n* Make it safer for passengers and drivers\n* Add Bitcoin integration\n* Add drivers/passengers rating\n* Add configuration based on zones and regions\n* Add more vehicle types\n* Make it easier to use and safer for moms/dads and children\n* Make it easier to use for people with disabilities\n* Add more translations\n* Add integration (click) tests (and infrastructure) for Telegram platform\n* Add delayed rides\n* Refactoring, refactoring, refactoring\n\n## Development guidelines\n\n* [Installing Node.js](doc/NODEJS.md)\n* [Getting started](doc/GETTING-STARTED.md)\n* [Redis](doc/REDIS.md)\n* [Esdoc](doc/ESDOC.md)\n* [Contributing](doc/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* [Add translation](doc/TRANSLATE.md)\n* [Debugging](doc/DEBUGGING.md)\n* [Using Vagrant](doc/VAGRANT.md)\n\n## Linux tweaks\n\nThis package is using unicode emojis. [Click here](https://github.com/eosrei/emojione-color-font#install-on-ubuntu-linux) to install them. Unfortunately, on Linux they are in one color in Terminal and in Atom editor.
