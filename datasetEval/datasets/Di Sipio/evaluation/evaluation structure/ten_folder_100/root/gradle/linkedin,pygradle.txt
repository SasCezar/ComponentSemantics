A deeper dive into what it takes to get started, how you can use our\ndemonstrative Artifactory instance, and a few project examples is available in\nour detailed [getting started](docs/getting-started.md) guide.\n\nAlthough not required, if you've never used Gradle before, you might\nfind reading Gradle's [user guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html)\nhelpful.\n\n## Plugins\n\nPyGradle comes with several plugins available, for specific details on each\nplugin check the documentation specific to that plugin.\n\n| Plugin                                                        | Usage                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| [com.linkedin.python](docs/plugins/python.md)                 | Extending PyGradle                            |\n| [com.linkedin.python-sdist](docs/plugins/python-sdist.md)     | Developing Source Distributions               |\n| [com.linkedin.python-web-app](docs/plugins/python-web-app.md) | Developing Flask/Gunicorn Web Applications    |\n| [com.linkedin.python-cli](docs/plugins/python-cli.md)         | Developing Command Line Applications          |\n| [com.linkedin.python-flyer](docs/plugins/python-flyer.md)     | Developing Flyer (Flask + Ember) Applications |\n| [com.linkedin.python-pex](docs/plugins/python-pex.md)         | Developing Pex Applications                   |\n\n# Developers\n\nWe're actively maintaining PyGradle and accepting pull requests.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing code to PyGradle, please see our\n[developers](docs/developers.md) document to get started. This document covers\nhow to build, test, and debug PyGradle, and kindly asks that you follow a few\nconventions when submitting pull requests.\n\n# Compatibility\n\n## Software\n\nWe support PyGradle on the following software versions.\n\n| Software | Version |\n|----------|---------|\n| Java     | 8.0     |\n| Gradle   | 5.0     |\n\nWe're happy to review and merge pull requests that add additional support to\nfuture versions of software.\n\n## Platforms\n\nPyGradle works on the following platforms.\n\n| Platform  | Support    |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Linux     | Full       |\n| OS X      | Full       |\n| Windows   | Partial    |\n\nAdditional compatibility notes are availabe [here](docs/compatibility.md).\nWe're happy to review and merge pull requests that add support for additional\nplatforms.\n"
