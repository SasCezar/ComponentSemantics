b"# Skript [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SkriptLang/Skript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SkriptLang/Skript)\r\nSkript is a plugin for Paper/Spigot, which allows server owners and other people\r\nto modify their servers without learning Java. It can also be useful if you\r\n*do* know Java; some tasks are quicker to do with Skript, and so it can be used\r\nfor prototyping etc.\r\n\r\nThis Github fork of Skript is based on Mirreski's improvements which was built\r\non Njol's original Skript.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nSkript requires **Spigot** to work. You heard it right, Bukkit does *not* work.\r\n**Paper**, which is a fork of Spigot, is recommended; it is required for some\r\nparts of Skript to be available.\r\n\r\nSkript supports only the **latest** patch versions of Minecraft 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13.\r\nFor example, this means that 1.12.2 is supported, but 1.12.1 is *not*.\r\nTesting with all old patch versions is not feasible for us.\r\n\r\nMinecraft 1.8 and earlier are not, and will not be supported. New Minecraft\r\nversions will be supported as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\nYou can find the downloads for each version with their release notes in the [releases page](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nDocumentation is available [here](https://skriptlang.github.io/Skript) for the\r\nlatest version of Skript.\r\n\r\n## Reporting Issues\r\nPlease see our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\nbefore reporting issues.\r\n\r\n## A Note About Add-ons\r\nWe don't support add-ons here, even though some of Skript developers have also\r\ndeveloped their own add-ons.\r\n\r\n## Compiling\r\nSkript uses Gradle for compilation. Use your command prompt of preference and\r\nnavigate to Skript's source directory. Then you can just call Gradle to compile\r\nand package Skript for you:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./gradlew clean build # on UNIX-based systems (mac, linux)\r\ngradlew clean build # on Windows\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can get source code from the [releases page](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases).\r\nYou may also clone this repository, but that code may or may not be stable.\r\n\r\n### Compiling Modules\r\nParts of Skript are provided as Gradle subprojects. They require Skript, so\r\nthey are compiled *after* it has been built. For this reason, if you want them\r\nembedded in Skript jar, you must re-package it after compiling once. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that modules are not necessary for Skript to work. Currently, they are\r\nonly used to provide compatibility with old WorldGuard versions.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nSkript has some tests written in Skript. Running them requires a Minecraft\r\nserver, but our build script can fetch it for you. Running tests is easy:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew (quickTest|skriptTest|skriptTestFull)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<code>quickTest</code> runs the test suite on newest supported server.\r\n<code>skriptTest</code> additionally runs the tests on oldest supported\r\nserver, and on 1.12 (pre-flattening). <code>skriptTestFull</code> runs\r\ntests on **ALL** supported versions, some of which do not work on Java 9+.\r\n\r\nBy running tests, you agree to Mojang's End User License Agreement.\r\n\r\n### Importing to Eclipse\r\nWith new Eclipse versions, there is integrated Gradle support, and it actually works now.\r\nSo, first get latest Eclipse, then import Skript as any Gradle project. Just\r\nmake sure to **keep** the configuration when the importer asks for that!\r\n\r\nIf you encounter strange issues, make sure you follow the instructions above and have\r\nactually downloaded latest Eclipse or update your installation correctly. Skript's\r\nnew Gradle version (starting from dev26) does not work very well with older Eclipse\r\nversions. Also, do *not* use Gradle STS; it is outdated.\r\n\r\n### Importing to IDEA\r\nYou'll need to make sure that nullness annotations are working correctly. Also,\r\nwhen sending pull requests, make sure not to change IDEA configuration files\r\nthat may have been stored in the repository.\r\n\r\n### Releasing\r\n```\r\n./gradlew clean build\r\n./gradlew <flavor>Release\r\n```\r\nAvailable flavors are github and spigot. Please do not abuse flavors by\r\ncompiling your own test builds as releases.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nPlease review our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\nIn addition to that, if you are contributing Java code, check our\r\n[coding conventions](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/blob/master/CODING_CONVENTIONS.md).\r\n\r\n## Maven Repository\r\nIf you use Skript as (soft) dependency for your plugin, and use maven or Gradle,\r\nthis is for you.\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to add the JitPack repository at the **END** of all your repositories. Skript is not available in Maven Central.\r\n```gradle\r\nrepositories {\r\n    jcenter()\r\n    ...\r\n    maven {\r\n        url 'https://jitpack.io'\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you use Maven:\r\n```maven\r\n<repositories>\r\n    <repository>\r\n        <id>jitpack.io</id>\r\n        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>\r\n    </repository>\r\n</repositories>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor versions of Skript after dev37 you might need to add the paper-api repository to prevent build issues.\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\nmaven {\r\n    url 'https://repo.destroystokyo.com/repository/maven-public/'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you use Maven:\r\n```maven\r\n<repository>\r\n    <id>destroystokyo-repo</id>\r\n    <url>https://repo.destroystokyo.com/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>\r\n</repository>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you will also need to add Skript as a dependency.\r\n```gradle\r\ndependencies {\r\n    implementation 'com.github.SkriptLang:Skript:[versionTag]'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example of the version tag would be ```dev37c```.\r\n\r\n> Note: If Gradle isn't able to resolve Skript's dependencies, just [disable the resolution of transitive dependencies](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/managing_transitive_dependencies.html#sub:disabling_resolution_transitive_dependencies) for Skript in your project.\r\n\r\nOr, if you use Maven:\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>com.github.SkriptLang</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>Skript</artifactId>\r\n    <version>[versionTag]</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Relevant Links\r\n* [skUnity forums](https://forums.skunity.com)\r\n* [Add-on releases at skUnity](https://forums.skunity.com/forums/addon-releases)\r\n* [Skript Chat Discord invite](https://discord.gg/0lx4QhQvwelCZbEX)\r\n* [Skript Hub](https://skripthub.net)\r\n* [Original Skript at Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/skript) (inactive)\r\n\r\nNote that these resources are not maintained by Skript's developers.
