b'# deep-clean\nA Kotlin script that nukes all build caches from Gradle/Android projects.\nUseful when Gradle or the IDE let you down \xf0\x9f\x92\x94\n\n![deep-clean in action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/153802/41173653-ab0ae36c-6b4f-11e8-8f98-8dba4340add7.png)\n\n\xf0\x9f\x8e\xa9 h/t to [@Takhion](https://github.com/Takhion) for the original idea, and to\n[@holgerbrandl](https://github.com/holgerbrandl) for KScript.\n\nThe script has been tested on macOS \xf0\x9f\x8d\x8e, but it is completely untested on\nLinux \xf0\x9f\x90\xa7 and Windows \xf0\x9f\x96\xa5\xef\xb8\x8f.\n\n\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8fThere may be [major issues](https://github.com/rock3r/deep-clean/issues/4) on Windows/Linux when using `-n`, please let me know if you encounter any such issue!\n\n**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK IN ANY CASE!**\n\n## Running the script\n\n`deep-clean` requires three components to be on your `PATH`:\n * [`kotlinc`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html)\n * [`kscript`](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript)\n * [`mvn`](https://maven.apache.org/)\n\nIf you **have all three commands** on your `PATH`, then you can simply download\nand execute the script:\n\n```bash\n$ cd /your/project/root.folder\n$ [kscript] deep-clean.kts [options]\n```\n\n>Note: on macOS and Linux the script does not need `kscript` to be invoked, because\n>it has a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)). On Windows, you\n>will need to explicitly specify you want to use `kscript` to run it.\n\nWhere the options are:\n\n```\n-b --backup           Renames files and folders instead of deleting them. Implies\n                      --verbose.\n-d --dry-run          Don\'t delete anything. Useful for testing. Implies --verbose.\n-i --ide-files        This also deletes IDEA/Android Studio project files (*.iml).\n                      If used in conjunction with --nuke it will also delete the\n                      .idea folder in the current directory.\n-p --ide-preferences  \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f  THIS IS DANGEROUS SHIT \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f  Will wipe your IDE settings!\n                      This deletes the GLOBAL IDEA/Android Studio preferences.\n                      This option requires the --nuke option to be active too, since\n                      it touches global system state.\n--not-recursive       Don\'t recursively search sub-folders of this folder for matches.\n                      The default behaviour is to look for matches in sub-directories,\n                      since things like \'build\' folders and \'.iml\' files are not all\n                      found at the top level of a project directory structure. This\n                      flag is useful if you know you have matches you want to keep,\n                      e.g., if your code contains a package with a name like \'build\'.\n                      This option severely limits the effectiveness of the deep clean.\n-n --nuke             \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f  THIS IS DANGEROUS SHIT \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f  Super-deep clean\n                      This includes clearing out global folders, including:\n                       * the global Gradle cache\n                       * the wrapper-downloaded Gradle distros\n                       * the Gradle daemon data (logs, locks, etc.)\n                       * the Android build cache\n                      Nukes the entire thing from orbit \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s the only way to be sure.\n-v --verbose          Print detailed information about all commands.\n```\n\nIf you **DON\'T have all three commands** on your `PATH`, then read on to the next\nsection to install them.\n\n## Installing the script dependencies\n\nTo make the script run, we\'ll first need to install all the required dependencies.\nAll dependencies are available on [SDKMan!](https://sdkman.io/) (Windows, Linux, macOS)\nand on [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (macOS only).\n\n**Windows, Linux:**\n\n```bash\n$ sdk install kotlin\n$ sdk install maven\n$ sdk install kscript\n```\n\n**macOS:**\n\n```bash\n$ brew install kotlin maven holgerbrandl/tap/kscript\n```\n\n## Licence\n\n```\nCopyright 2018 Sebastiano Poggi\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n\nFor more information please refer to the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) file.\n'
