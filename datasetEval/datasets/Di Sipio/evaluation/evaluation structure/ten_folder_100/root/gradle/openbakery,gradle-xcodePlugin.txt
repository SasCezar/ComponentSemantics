[Send me a mail (rene@openbakery.org)](mailto:rene@openbakery.org) and I will send you an invitation**\n\nThe gradle xcode plugin (gxp) makes it easier to build Xcode projects by specifying the build settings in a single configuration file. The goal is to keep the build file as simple as possible, but also enable a great flexibility for the build.\n\nThe gxp uses the Apple command line tools (like xcodebuild) to perform the build.\n\nHere a brief overview of the features:\n\n* Build iOS, watchOS, tvOS and Mac projects\n* Override sign settings for builds\n* Perform unit tests\n* Support for multiple Xcodes (on one machine)\n* [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) support\n* [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) support\n* [Appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/) support\n* Code coverage support (using [gcovr](http://gcovr.com) or using [CoverageReport](https://github.com/openbakery/CoverageReport) )\n* [Hockeykit](http://hockeykit.net/), [HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net), [DeployGate](https://deploygate.com/) , [Apple TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/), [Crashlytics](https://www.crashlytics.com/)\n* OCLint\n\n\n## Note\n\nChanged the version number scheme. The minor version number now stands for the year, therfor it is now 19.\nThe minor versions are the release numbers then.\nThe 0.15.4 was the first release 2019 that uses the old scheme that didn\'t follow any rules. (This should have been 0.19.0)\nNow the current version is 0.19.1 that is the second release this year. The third will then be 0.19.2.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Xcode 6 or greater\n* [Gradle](http://gradle.org) 2.14 or greater\n* Java 1.6 or greater\n\n\n### Current stable version is 0.19.1\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Documentation](https://openbakery.org/gxp/)\n\n\n## Usage\n\nCreate a build.gradle file and place it in the same directory where xcodeproj file lies.\n\nHere the minimal content you need in your build.gradle file:\n\n```\nplugins {\n  id "org.openbakery.xcode-plugin" version "0.19.1"\n}\n\nxcodebuild {\n  scheme = \'MY-SCHEMA\'\n  target = \'MY-TARGET\'\n}\n\n```\n\nYou can also use the version that is deployed the repository on [openbakery.org](https://openbakery.org) with the following build.gradle file configuration:\n```\nbuildscript {\n  repositories {\n    maven {\n      url(\'http://repository.openbakery.org/\')\n    }\n  mavenCentral()\n  }\n\n  dependencies {\n    classpath "org.openbakery:xcode-plugin:0.19.+"\n  }\n}\n\napply plugin: "org.openbakery.xcode-plugin"\n```\n\n### Current develop version\n\nWhen using the [openbakery.org](https://openbakery.org) repository you can also get the latest develop version by including `develop` into the version pattern. e.g.: \n```\nclasspath "org.openbakery:xcode-plugin:0.19.1.develop.+"\n```\n\nThe develop version contains all the changes from the develop branch, where all the fixes and feature are implemented. The development version is deployed automatically when all the projects unit tests are  successful, and also the if the example projects build. \n\n\n## Example\n\nYou find example projects in [example/](example/) with a working build.gradle file.\nAfter you have fetched the example go to the `example/iOS/Example` directory and you build the project different targets:\n\n* Build with `gradle xcodebuild`\n* Run the unit tests with `gradle test`\n* Perform a device build and upload it to hockeyapp with `gradle integration`. Here you need to specify your sign settings first (see [Signing](Documentation/Parameters.md#sign-settings) ). Open the build.gradle file an follow the instructions.\n* Perform an appstore build with `gradle appstore`. (Also the sign settings are needed).\n\n# Collaborate\n\nI\'m always happy to receive pull requests with new features and if you send a pull request please consider the following things:\n\n* Use the _develop_ branch for pull requests, because all the new stuff is implemented in the _develop_ branch and also pull requests are always merge into _develop_\n* Use Tabs instead of spaces.\n* Make sure that all unit tests are working before you send the pull request. Just run \'gradle test\' \n* I urge you to write unit tests. \n* For unit test please use the [spock framework](http://spockframework.org) for mocking. I want to remove the old gmock framework and port the old tests to use spock.\n* Pull requests that contains new features or fixes but without any unit tests will NOT be merged.\n\n\n# License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the Apache license.
