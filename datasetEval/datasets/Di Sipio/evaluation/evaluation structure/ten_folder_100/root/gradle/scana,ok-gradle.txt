b'**This plugin is still in alpha stage, so it might be unstable. Feel free to share your feedback and report issues!**\n\nThis plugin is in JetBrains Plugins Repository! Get it from [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10102-ok-gradle-).\n\n# OK, Gradle!\n![Take a look](images/look_and_feel.gif)\n\nIntelliJ/Android Studio Plugin for searching artifacts ids of popular Java libraries.\n\nUse those for adding new dependencies easily to your build.gradle files.\n\n#### Retrofit - which one was it?\n```\ncompile \'com.square.retrofit:retrofit2:2.3.0\'\ncompile \'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.3.0\'\n```\n\n#### Android Design library - which one was it?\n```\ncompile \'com.android.support:design:26.1.0\'\ncompile \'com.android.support:support-design:26.1.0\'\n```\n\nWith this plugin, you won\'t have to remember it anymore nor open an external browser to search for it on the Internet.\n\nUsage:\n\nFind the **OK, Gradle** action  with `CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+A` shortcut and type library\'s name that you are looking for in an input field.\n\nTo make your life even more easier, assign a shortcut to it. Personally, I prefer `CMD+K` - as in **"OK!"** (I don\'t use commit action in the IDE anyway).\n\nYou need to have an active Internet connection to be able to use this tool.\n\n## Disclaimer\nI want to thank <a href="https://chrisbroadfoot.id.au">Chris Broadfoot</a> for creating <a href="http://gradleplease.appspot.com">http://gradleplease.appspot.com</a> website, which was an inspiration for this plugin.\n\n## Roadmap (take it with a grain of salt)\n- local storage for collecting info about most used artifacts (for sorting purposes)\n- global online db for storing information about most used artifacts (for sorting purposes)\n- settings panel for tweaking things \n- ???\n\n## License\n```\nCopyright 2017 Marcin Robaczy\xc5\x84ski\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n'
