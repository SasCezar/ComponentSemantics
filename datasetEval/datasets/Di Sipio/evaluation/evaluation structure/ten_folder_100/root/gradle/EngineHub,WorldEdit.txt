b'![WorldEdit](worldedit-logo.png)\n=========\n\nWorldEdit is Minecraft mod that turns Minecraft into an in-game map editor (sorta, kinda).\n\n* Make awesome stuff with half the time OR make ***quadruply** awesome* creations with the same time :sparkles:\n* Get lost in hundreds of options and functions that even we\'ve forgotten existed\n* Utilize Photoshop-like tools like "selection areas" and "brushes"\n* Making fjords and other natural wonders with weird names\n* Also: fix grief, broken water, missing snow, raging fires, and other :poop:\n\nWorldEdit is open source!, so if you\'ve just learned how to make a button blink, I probably recommend picking up a book on CS algorithms.
