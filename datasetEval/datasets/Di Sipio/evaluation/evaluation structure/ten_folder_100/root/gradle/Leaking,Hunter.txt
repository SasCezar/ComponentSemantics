You can use Hunter to develop more plugins\nto monitor your app, enhance 3rd-dependency, enhance android framework. Plugins based on Hunter support incremental and concurrent compile, so you don\'t need to\nafraid of extra build time.\n\n## Some useful plugins based on Hunter\n\n + [OkHttp-Plugin](https://github.com/Leaking/Hunter/blob/master/README_hunter_okhttp.md): Hack Okhttp to set a global Interceptor/Eventlistener/Dns\n for all your OkhttpClients, even clients in 3rd-party library.\n + [Timing-Plugin](https://github.com/Leaking/Hunter/blob/master/README_hunter_timing.md): you can time all your ui-thread methods, and dump the block traces with costed-time of every step, you also can consume the block detail in your way.\n + [Debug-Plugin](https://github.com/Leaking/Hunter/blob/master/README_hunter_debug.md): you can simply add a annotation to a certain method, and the method will print all parameters and costed time, return value.
