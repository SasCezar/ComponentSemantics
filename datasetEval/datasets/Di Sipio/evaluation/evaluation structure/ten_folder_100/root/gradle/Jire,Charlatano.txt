b'# Charlatano\n_Cheating is but a lifestyle_\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jire/Charlatano.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jire/Charlatano)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Jire/Charlatano.svg)](https://github.com/Jire/Charlatano/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n\n### Support the Project\n\n**Donate with Bitcoin:** 3GqvcPY4rKcMxKU3jE59A2UHfV3NAyUhA6  \n**Or with PayPal:** thomasgnappo@gmail.com\n\n---\n\n**From the creators of Abendigo** comes a brand new approach to cheating-- _Charlatano_ can be completely\n__stream-proof__, hiding the fact that you\'re cheating while streaming, and completely bypasses SMAC server-sided\nanticheat as well as FaceIT\'s modified SMAC. Turning off visuals or using a screenshot blocker\n(like hypervisor-powered protection against screenshots in Kaspersky) can potentially allow you to play on leagues\nlike ESEA for weeks or months. _Charlatano_ uses strong humanizing settings that bring the public the next step in\nfree and open-source cheating software!\n\n---\n\n**Available Features**\n* Works on Danger Zone (battle royale)\n* Always-on all-weapon smooth dynamic recoil control system\n* Aim bot with humanized aim paths\n* Low-FOV "perfect aim" (non-silent)\n* Aim assistance mode for professional and high-level players\n* Bone trigger\n* Reduced flash\n* Stream-proof OpenGL overlay with box and skeleton ESP\n* Glow ESP (not stream-proof)\n* Humanized bunny hop using scroll input\n* "Flat" aim bot with traditional linear-regression paths (not safe for use on leagues! use "PathAim" instead)\n\n---\n\n**Beginner\'s Guide**\n\nBefore doing anything, make sure you have\n[Java Development Kit (JDK) 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)\nor later installed. This is NOT the same thing as the regular Java Runtime (JRE), and you MUST install the JDK\nin order to build Charlatano, as well as any other Java software.\n\nThe first step is to compile the source code into a usable cheat program.\n\n* Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jire/Charlatano)\n* Click on the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Jire/Charlatano/releases) tab\n* Download the latest release ZIP archive\n* Extract the contents from the archive to any folder (to your desktop, for example)\n* Make sure you have Java Development Kit 8 or later installed\n* Double click on the "_build_" (_build.bat_) script and wait for it to complete\n\nOnce those steps are complete, the usable cheat program can be found within the _build_\ndirectory, and will in a directory called **Charlatano 1.0.11**.\n\nFrom within the **Charlatano 1.0.11** directory, you can start the cheat by running\nthe _"Start Charlatano 1.0.11"_ script.\n\nBefore starting the cheat, you should already be spawned in a game with a weapon in hand!\n\n---\n\n**Beginner\'s Guide Video**\n\n[![Beginner\'s Video](http://i.imgur.com/pVLW5Yr.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PapjDtR0OMY "Charlatano")\n\n---\n\n**Copyright** (AGPL-3.0)\n\n```\nCharlatano: Free and open-source (FOSS) cheat for CS:GO/CS:CO\nCopyright (C) 2017 - Thomas G.
