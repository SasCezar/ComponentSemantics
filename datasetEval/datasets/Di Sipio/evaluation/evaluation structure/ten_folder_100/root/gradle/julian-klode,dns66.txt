b'DNS-Based Host Blocking for Android\n===================================\nThis is a DNS-based host blocker for Android. In the default configuration,\nseveral widely-respected host files are used to block ads, malware, and other\nweird stuff.\n\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/julian-klode/dns66/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/julian-klode/dns66)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/julian-klode/dns66.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/julian-klode/dns66)\n\nInstalling\n----------\n[<img src="https://f-droid.org/badge/get-it-on.png"\n      alt="Get it on F-Droid"\n      height="80">](https://f-droid.org/app/org.jak_linux.dns66)\n\nYou can either install it via F-Droid, using the official F-Droid repository, or you can use my personal repository at https://jak-linux.org/fdroid/repo which gets updates ASAP.\n\nYou can also download apk files in GitHub\'s download section. Currently, these are the same files as in my personal F-Droid repository, but that might change in the future.\n\nXDA: Discussions and preview builds\n-----------------------------------\nThere is a thread at XDA, where DNS66 can be discussed and I occasionaly post\npreview builts of the git repository:\n\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-dns66-source-host-ad-blocker-root-t3487497\n\nUsing it\n---------\nOn the first start, you must manually update the hosts files (using the\nrefresh button) before the service can work correctly (issue #1); and you\nmust also update the hosts files yourself regularly for now (issue #2).\n\nItems in the hosts and DNS servers lists can be moved around and removed)\nof the list using standard RecyclerView interactions (long press makes the\nentry movable, swipe to either side removes it). For hosts, a later entry\noverrides a previous entry; for DNS servers, the first server is preferred.\n\nCurrently, there are some minor usability issues:\n\n* If you change a setting, you must manually restart the vpn service (issue #3)\n* IPv6 servers are not supported (issue #4)\n\nThere\'s also no validation of input, so DNS servers that are not valid IPv4\naddresses are not rejected, neither are URLs for DNS server entries (we intend\nto support URLs in the future, so you can point the app to a remote list of\nservers).\n\nHow it works\n------------\nThe app establishes a VPN service, with routes for all DNS servers diverted to\nit. The VPN service then intercepts the packages for the servers and forwards\nany DNS queries that are not blacklisted.\n\nCustom upstream DNS can be configured. If the feature is turned off, the\ncurrent connection\'s DNS servers are used. The app ships are pre-defined\nlist of well known (mostly German) non-logging servers courtesy of the\nChaos Computer Club.\n\n\nPrivacy Guarantee\n-----------------\nPrivacy is the most important aspect of DNS66. Currently, DNS66 is strictly\ndata reducing: Running it can only reduce the amount of data leaving your\ndevice, not increase it (except for fetching hosts files, obviously), as for\neach request, we will either allow it to leave your device or not - we will\nnot send other requests or add other information to the request.\n\nWhile not yet implemented, future versions of DNS66 might have additional\nfeatures that might share more data than your phone normally would. Among\nthese features are:\n\n1. Automatic updates. Your phone might periodically contact servers to query\n   for new upstream versions and new host lists. DNS66 will only include as\n   much data as necessary to complete the request.\n\n2. Debugging. We hope to have a better way to debug program failures than\n   manually running logcat. Such a feature by definition requires sharing\n   debug logs. Debug logs (including logcat) may include personal information,\n   and you should review them before sharing them publicly.\n\nIf such a feature is added, you will be presented with the choice to enable\nit (it will be disabled by default). No such feature will be turned on without\nyour explicit consent (for example, clicking yes in a dialog asking whether you\nwant to have automatic updates).\n\nContributing\n------------\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nLicense\n-------\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nParts of the program are licensed under only version 3 of the license, and\nsome parts might be licensed under the terms of other compatible licenses.
