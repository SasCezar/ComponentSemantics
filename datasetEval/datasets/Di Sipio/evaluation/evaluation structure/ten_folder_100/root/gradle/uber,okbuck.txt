b'# OkBuck\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uber/okbuck.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uber/okbuck)\n[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/uber/gradle-plugins/okbuck/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/uber/gradle-plugins/okbuck/_latestVersion)\n\nOkBuck is a gradle plugin that lets developers utilize the [Buck](https://buckbuild.com/) build system on a gradle project.\n\n[Wiki](https://github.com/uber/okbuck/wiki), [\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87\xe7\x89\x88](https://github.com/uber/okbuck/blob/master/README-zh.md)\n\n## Installation\nThese are needed to build with buck\nInstallation instructions for: [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html), [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)\n\n### Configuration\nSet the `ANDROID_NDK` environment variable to point to your android ndk installation\n\nIn root project `build.gradle` file:\n\n```gradle\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        jcenter()\n    }\n    dependencies {\n        classpath \'com.uber:okbuck:0.49.3\'\n    }\n}\n\nrepositories {\n    jcenter()\n}\n\napply plugin: \'com.uber.okbuck\'\n```\n\nAfter applying the plugin, the following tasks will be added to the root project\n  +  `buckWrapper` will create a buck wrapper script and various configuration files to invoke buck commands\n  +  `okbuck` will generate BUCK files\n\n### Buck Wrapper\n\nRun the buck wrapper task\n```bash\n./gradlew :buckWrapper\n```\nThis creates a `buckw` wrapper similar to the gradle wrapper\n\nInvoking buck commands via the buck wrapper has several advantages\n- Downloads/installs/updates buck\n- Minimal overhead to decide when to run `okbuck` before invoking buck (using watchman)\n- Handles gracefully, the cases when `okbuck` task fails/is stopped abruptly\n\nPlease make sure you have watchman installed for `buckw` to run `okbuck` only when needed. A new `okbuck` run is typically needed when gradle configuration or Android manifest files change. If watchman is not installed, the `okbuck` task in always run before invoking any buck commands.\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n# List all buck targets\n./buckw targets //...\n\n# Build a target\n./buckw build <target>\n\n# Install an apk target\n./buckw install --run <apk-target>\n\n# Generate an Intellij project\n./buckw project\n```\n\nSee the [Usage](https://github.com/uber/okbuck/blob/master/Usage.md) page for complete details on how to configure OkBuck and Buck.\n\n## Buck Http Cache\n\nTo speed up your builds even more, you can use an implementation of [Buck\'s HTTP Cache API](https://github.com/uber/buck-http-cache) to take advantage of building once and using the same build artifacts on all machines.\n\n## Contributors\n\nWe\'d love for you to contribute to our open source projects.
