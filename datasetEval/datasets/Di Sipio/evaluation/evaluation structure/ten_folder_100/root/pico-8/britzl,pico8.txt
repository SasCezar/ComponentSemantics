b'# Pico-8 Tweetjam API\nThis is an experiment to run [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) [Tweetjam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tweetjam?src=hash) carts in Defold.\n\n# Pico-8 API for Defold\nThe `pico8` folder contains a partial (very!) implementation of the Pico-8 API. The API functions that are implemented are focused on the ones typically used in Tweetjam carts (circ, circfill, line etc)\n\nThe `tweetjam` folder contains a bootstrap collection and a script to run a Tweetjam cart/string using the Defold Pico-8 API.\n\n# Credits\nThis project would not have been possible without the [DrawPixels extension](https://www.defold.com/community/projects/106110/) by Agulev.
