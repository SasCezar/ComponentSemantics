b'# zzlib-pico8\n\nThis is a PICO-8\xe2\x80\x93compatible Lua implementation of a depacker for the zlib\nDEFLATE(RFC1951)/GZIP(RFC1952) file format.\n\n## Usage\n\nzzlib basically allows to depack compressed data stored inside a PICO-8\ncartridge file. Just embed your gzipped file(s) into one data section\nof the cartridge, along with the zzlib source code, and you can depack\nyour data onto the video memory or general purpose memory.\n\nDepacking a file is as easy as calling a function, giving the destination\nand source addresses as arguments:\n\n    -- zzlib source code included above\n    ...\n    -- unpack data from the beginning of the gfx section to video memory\n    zzlib.gunzip(0x6000,0x0)\n\nThe code above is used in the example in the `example` directory.\n\n## Tools\n\nFor the moment, a unique tool is provided in the `tools` directory.\n\n* `makecart.lua` generates a cart file with the specified\nsection contents. See the example usage of that tool in the\nbuild script in the `examples` directory.\n\n\n\n## External links and references\n\n* [Original zzlib in standard Lua](https://github.com/zerkman/zzlib)\n'
