b"# Knifey Spoony\n\n## A game for PICO-8 by [Jonic](https://100yen.co.uk) and [Ribbon Black](http://ribbonblack.com)\n\n> I see you've played Knifey Spoony before!\n\nKnifey Spoony is a game in which the player must identify knives and spoons within an ever-decreasing time limit.\n\n* Concept and code by [Jonic Linley](https://www.100yen.co.uk)\n* Artwork by [Ribbon Black](https://www.ribbonblack.com)\n\n## Why does this exist?\n\nWhy not? Also this: https://youtu.be/mcE0aAhbVFc\n\n## What is PICO-8?\n\nThis game is built in [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a fantasy game console with a very restricted set of tools, and a focus on simplicity.\n\nI've tried making games in the past, but have often felt my ideas getting too complex, or that I get bogged down by the learning curve of a whole game engine. PICO-8 forces developers to keep things simple by only providing an incredibly limited set of tools with which to author a game.\n\nOne of my favorite things about PICO-8 is that an entire game is just small enough that the entire [mental model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model) can fit in your head as you're developing it. I also find myself continually delighted while working on this game, because it's so easy to make things happen. PICO-8 includes:\n\n* An [API](https://neko250.github.io/pico8-api/)\n* A code editor ([optional](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=manual))\n* A sprite editor\n* A map editor\n* A sound effect editor\n* A music sequencer\n\n...and that's it. The engine itself is left to you. PICO-8 gives you functions to `_update` and `_draw` your game at 30FPS (60 is optional), and leaves everything else to you.\n\nNeed a text engine? Write one. Need a sprite animation library? That's on you. Want to apply physics to your sprites? You need to sit under a tree and have an apple hit you on the head and then you go and write the code.\n\nIf you're looking for an introductory platform for game development, then PICO-8 is definitely worth a look. I will also attempt to add comments to this code in order to more effectively illustrate how it works. I'll also talk about some of the tools I created in this README, so that you might take them and reuse them in your own games.\n\n## Any questions?\n\nI can't help you write your game, but I can help explain how this one works if you need help understanding what's going on here. [Get in touch with me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jonic) and I'll see what I can do.\n\n## Contributions welcome!\n\nIf you think you can help improve this game, or if you spot a bug, please let me know! I'd love this game to be a well commented source for beginners to get to grips with PICO-8 (despite being a beginner myself when I wrote it), so help with that is also welcome."
