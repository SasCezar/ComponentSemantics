b'# Depicofier\n\nConverts/translates PICO-8 style Lua syntax to standard clean Lua syntax. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Enichan/Depicofier/releases) here.\n\nThis tool uses a [publicly available and well-tested Lua language grammar](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/lua) to parse PICO-8 source code, so that any enhanced or special syntax or shorthand will only be converted where it should be.\n\nIf you like this tool please consider kicking me a dollar [on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sharkhugseniko).\n\n# Usage\n\n```\nDepicofier.exe [inFile] [outFile]\nOr to output source to console:\nDepicofier.exe [inFile] -print\nSwitches:\n-strict   Print warnings for Lua syntax not found in Pico 8 such as binary\n          operators, integer division, and bitwise shifts\n```'
