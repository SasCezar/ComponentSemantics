b"#### Guys, this branch is used for porting **neko8** to **c++**. It is not stable or usable yet, we will announce, when it will be.\n\n# neko8\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/314487938949971980/355710597528027146/Peek_2017-09-08_16-43.gif)\n\n[**Neko8**](https://egordorichev.itch.io/neko8) is a **fantasy console**, inspired by [**pico8**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), [**liko12**](https://ramilego4game.itch.io/liko12) and [**tic80**](https://tic.computer/). It is open-source and fully free. Its goal is to be a fun and useful tool for game development and **especially for game jams**. \n\n[![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/356934835052478470/358195024808116225/Screenshot_2017-09-15_at_1.18.32_PM.png)](https://egordorichev.itch.io/neko8)\n\nCurrently it features:\n\n* Pico8-like api\n* Code editor\n* Sprite editor\n* Map editor prototype\n* Terminal\n* Build-in API docs\n* Support for both lua and asm programming (planning add BASIC support)\n* Some easter eggs ;)\n\nOur developers can be found on [discord](https://discord.gg/DPBN8Xn).\n\n#### Installing ang running\n\nDownload and extract the source. In the root folder run:\n\n```\nlove .\n```\n\nYou will need **l\xc3\xb6ve2d 0.10.2** to run **neko8**. L\xc3\xb6ve2d version is really important!\n\n### Contributing\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to **neko8**, feel free to fork and make pull\nrequests! However, we ask you to follow the formatting guidelines for this\nproject. \n\n - Use non-expanded, i.e. the regular, tabs.\n - Keep a maximum line length of 80 characters.\n - Double quotes are preferred over single quotes.\n - Don't use concatenation where `string.format` would be more beneficial.\n - If unsure how to format something, check how it's formatted in existing code.\n"
