b"# pico-tools\n> Fast and simple.  Just like me.  - the author\n\nDon't make me take my hands off the home row!\nThis is a toolchain I use to make pico-8 dev a little faster and more flexible.\n\n`setup` lets you configure the current folder for pico-tools.(you can have different settings per folder)\n`build` will load your cart in pico-8, and auto-play automatically.\n`watch` will detect changes to your .p8 file and run another `build`.\n`add_vscode_tasks` will copy over a .vscode/tasks.json file which let you do the same, but from a hotkey.\n\n## PreReqs\n1. An installed copy of [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/)\n2. requires [nodejs and npm](http://www.nodejs.org)\n\n## Gimme Gimme!\nYeah, yeah, calm down.\n```bash\n# install pico-tools with \nnpm install -g pico-tools\n```\n\n## Setup is a piece of cake\npico-tools uses an environment variable to know where your pico-8 executable is.\n\nThere are many ways to do that, but we've included an easy way for beginners:\n\nSimply create a `.env` file at the root of your project folder with one of the following: ( Your setup may differ slightly. )\n\n```bash\n# Typical Windows setup\nPICO8=c:\\Users\\nicho\\Desktop\\pico-8_win32\\pico8.exe\n\n# Typical MacOS setup\nPICO8 = /Applications/PICO-8/PICO-8.app/Contents/MacOS/pico8\n```\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n---\n\n### `pico-tools build`\n\n```bash\n# run a cartridge in pico-8 and have it auto-play.\n\npico-tools build path/to/cartridge.p8\n```\n\n---\n\n### `pico-tools watch`\n\n```bash\n# watch a specific file for changes, and then reload automatically.\n\npico-tools watch path/to/cartridge.p8\n```\n\n***WARNING***  If you use the watch command, please note that when the tools trigger a reload, you will lose any unsaved changes in the pico editor.  This goes for sprites and music too!  Keep that in mind so you don't lose work!\n\n---\n\n### `pico-tools vscode_tasks`\n```bash\n# This will create `.vscode/tasks.json` in your current directory.  This lets me hit `cntrl+shift+b` and activate one of the tools.\n\npico-tools vscode_tasks\n```\n\n---\n\n### `pico-tools home`\n\n```bash\n# will open the pico-tools github page\n\npico-tools home\n```\n\n---\n\n### `pico-tools bbs`\n\n```bash\n# will open the pico-8 bbs in your browser\n\npico-tools bbs\n```\n\n---\n\n### `pico-tools man`\n\n```bash\n# This will echo the Pico-8 Documentation to the terminal.\n# Combine this with other tools like less or grep!\n# example:    pico-tools man | less\npico-tools man\n```\n\n---\n"
