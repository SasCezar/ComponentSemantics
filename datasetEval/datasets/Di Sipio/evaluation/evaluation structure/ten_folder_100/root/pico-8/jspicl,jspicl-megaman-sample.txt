b"# PICO-8 MegaMan\nThis is a sample project demonstrating how you can use [jspicl-cli](https://github.com/AgronKabashi/jspicl-cli) to build PICO-8 games with Javascript.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QSaLt5q.gif)\n\n## Usage\n```Shell\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis will create a cartridge and automatically launch it in PICO-8. Whenever source files are changed, a rebuild will take place and reload PICO-8 with the updated cartridge for you.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1uS6eck.gif)\n\n```\nnpm run restore-cart\n```\n\nThis will take the game.p8 cartridge in the project root and put it in the build directory for you.\n**CAUTION**: This will overwrite any existing cartridge in the destination folder so make sure you do a backup first.\n\n## Updating spritesheet\nWith jspicl-CLI you don't need to draw your sprites in PICO-8 anymore. Simply edit the spritesheet file, save and the cart will be reloaded with the new changes.\n\n![](https://github.com/AgronKabashi/assets/raw/814f6efe24bc9aca5d9d6ca6259279733529e300/rollup-plugin-jspicl/spritesheetLiveReload.gif)\n\n## Other `jspicl` games\n* [https://github.com/topics/jspicl-sample](https://github.com/topics/jspicl-sample)\n"
