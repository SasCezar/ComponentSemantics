Consider it alpha quality, since it doesn\'t support the functionality of [Segment\'s official sources](https://segment.com/docs/sources/).\n\n<br>\n\n## Wait, what?\n\nPICO-8 is a tool that you can use to create (and distribute) small, retro-style games. It\'s like Unity \xe2\x80\x93 the game engine \xe2\x80\x93 but with more design constraints to encourage you to keep your project scope small. Admittedly, it\'s kinda nerdy.\n\nSegment is an awesome analytics product that intends to be your **customer data infrastructure**. You can use Segment to track user events, send events out to hundreds of analytics tools automatically, and use these tools to derive insights from your data. Armed with these insights, you can find ways to improve your game\'s design.\n\n<br>\n\n## Awesome, how do I use it?\n\n### Learn\n\nIf you\'re new to PICO-8, I suggest skimming the [manual](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=manual) for an overview.\n\n<br>\n\n### Copy and paste\n\nCopy and paste [`track.lua`](./track.lua) into your PICO-8 game.\n\n<br>\n\n### API\n\n`track.lua` will expose a single function `track()` globally. To use:\n\n```lua\n-- API:\ntrack(event, properties?)\n\n-- Example:\ntrack(\'Level Cleared\', {\n  level             = 4,\n  time              = 39.2,\n  found_secret_room = true,\n})\n```\n\nYou can track as many events and properties as you want, subject to PICO-8\'s char and token limits. `track.lua` serializes `track()` calls to PICO-8\'s [GPIO pins](http://pico-8.wikia.com/wiki/GPIO), so be aware that you have 128 bytes of info per `track()` call.\n\n<br>\n\n### Export, insert `track.html` and `analytics.js`\n\nIn the PICO-8 console, export your game to HTML5:\n\n```sh\n> EXPORT YOUR_GAME.HTML\n```\n\nFind your `<script>` tag in the generated HTML. It should look like this:\n\n```html\n<script async type="text/javascript" src="your_game.js"></script>\n```\n\nAbove it, insert the contents of [`track.html`](./track.html), then the `analytics.js` snippet ([view here](https://segment.com/docs/sources/website/analytics.js/quickstart/)). Verify that your Segment write key is present \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0check the setup instructions for details.\n\nYou can reference [`track_test.html`](./track_test.html) as an example.\n\n<br>\n\n### Celebrate\n\nIf all goes well, you should see events flowing through to Segment\'s Debugger:\n\n<img width="1300" alt="screen shot 2018-08-08 at 1 50 50 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/914228/43863611-1736cca8-9b12-11e8-97e4-f07de2bdf88c.png">\n\nYou now have the ability to understand how players interact with your game\'s design! Go forth and inform your designs with data.\n\n<br>\n\n## Feedback\n\nPlease open an [issue](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-pico8/issues/new).\n\n<br>\n\n## License\n\n`analytics-pico8` is released under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2018 Segment.io, Inc.\n'
