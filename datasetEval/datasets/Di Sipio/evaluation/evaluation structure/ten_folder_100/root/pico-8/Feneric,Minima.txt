b'Minima\n======\n\n*My homage to the 8-bit Ultima games.*\n\n.. image:: MinimaLogo.png\n  :alt: Minima Logo\n  :align: right\n\nWhat Is It?\n-----------\n\nMinima is an adventure RPG in the style of the older Ultima games as played on the\nCommodore 8-bit computers. Just like the original Ultima games, it includes a world\nview, enterable towns, and 3D dungeon displays. It also features graphics, sound\neffects, and music that should help one recollect those classics. More importantly,\nit is a fully playable (and winnable) game with its own backstory, plot, setting, and\ncharacters.\n\nYou can play it online on the `Minima at Lexaloffle page`_ or play it directly through\nany PICO-8 environment by using the `splore` utility. You can also grab binaries for\nLinux, macOS, and MS-Windows through the release link or via the `Minima Itch.io page`_.\n\n.. image:: MinimaWorld.png\n  :alt: Minima world view\n  :align: center\n\nScreenshot of the world view in Minima.

The player is being\nattacked by both an orc (shown directly ahead) and a ghost (from behind). Yikes!\n\nWhat Is It About?\n-----------------\n\nFiguring this out is part of the game. You\'re in the land of Miskatonia and you start\nout within sight of a town and a dungeon. It\'s recommended that you try the town first.\nAlso, you start off without any weapons or armor, and this is a very precarious situation\nto be in. You\'ll want to rectify it as quickly as possible. If you\'ve not done so yet,\nyou should peruse the manual and get some tips about surviving in Miskatonia and some\nwarnings about the Faxon as well as basic information about game controls. If you are\ntoo impatient to skim through the manual, the basic game controls are accessible from\nwithin the pause menu of the game itself. Pressing the `p` key (or the `enter` key on\nsome platforms) should bring up this menu.\n\nOrigins (yes, I know it\'s a pun)\n--------------------------------\n\nAs a kid I enjoyed playing the 8-bit `Ultima games`_ on the `C64`_ and `C128`_. First\nthere was `Ultima II`_ with its multiple worlds, time-travel, and challenge in the\nTime of Legends. Then there was `Ultima III`_ with its smaller space but better\ngraphics and gameplay, and its mystery around Exodus. Then came `Ultima IV`_, with a\nmuch bigger space and much better story, and an early prominent use of the word "avatar".\nThen was the somewhat belated release of `Ultima I`_ for those who wanted more details\non the backstory. Then came `Ultima V`_, which not only improved upon the storytelling\nin Ultima IV, but also took great advantage of the C128 hardware and provided what\nI\'d argue to be one of the best gaming experiences on the system. Then came `Ultima VI`_,\nwhich was a disappointment on the C128 and essentially unplayable. The less\nsaid about that one, the better.\n\nI never got into Ultima again after #6, but I still have fond memories of playing\nit. I noticed that `GOG`_ was making Ultima IV available again right around the same\ntime I\'d started tinkering around with `PICO-8`_ on the `PocketC.H.I.P.`_, and while\nporting `xu4`_ to the PocketC.H.I.P. as part of `PocketInstaller`_, I got a wild idea:\nwhy not try to make a full game inspired by the old-school Ultimas within the\nrestrictive limits imposed by PICO-8? This project is the result of my efforts, an\nhomage to all the old 8-bit Ultima games, but especially numbers II through V.\n\nStatus\n------\n\nThis project is at version 1.1. It is completely playable from beginning to end.\n\nMany features of the Ultima series as played on the C128 work. You can move around\nand explore the world map and enter towns and dungeons. Town views and dungeon views\nboth work, and dungeons require torches to see. Looking at things and searching for\nthings works. Checking status works. Creature movement and behavior works. Combat\nworks in both world and dungeon views. Dialog with townies works.\nPurchasing in towns works. Spells work. Capturing pirate ships works, and with one\nit\'s possible to explore the waters of the world map. Leveling up works. Sound effects\nare in place. The in-game help screen works. Saving and loading games works, although\nit has some unavoidable limitations (most notably only the ship that your character\nis on will be saved). Background music works. Increasing attributes works. Fountains\nwork. It\'s winnable.\n\nCompared to the earlier version 1.0, version 1.1 features improved creature movement,\nguild shops with working keys and torches, more townies with more clues, openable\ntreasure chests, more challenging dungeons, a tower puzzle, enterable shrines, and\nmany minor bugfixes.\n\nDue largely to the existence of chests and additional dungeon levels, this version\nrequires less grinding than version 1.0; due largely to the existence of more\ncharacters, this version has a bit more story. It is much closer to what I had set\nout originally to build.\n\nSupported Platforms\n-------------------\n\nMinima will run everywhere that PICO-8 runs. By design it does not require the latest\n& greatest version of PICO-8, so it\'ll even run on PocketC.H.I.P.\n\n.. image:: MinimaPocketCHIP.jpg\n  :alt: Minima running on a PocketCHIP\n  :align: center\n\nPhotograph of Minima running on a PocketC.H.I.P.\n\n.. image:: MinimaGPD.jpg\n  :alt: Minima running on a GPD Pocket Laptop\n  :align: center\n\nPhotograph of Minima running on a GPD Pocket Ubuntu Laptop\n\nChallenges\n----------\n\nThe constraints of building something within the PICO-8 environment make a project like\nthis fairly tough. This game pretty much maxes out PICO-8 capacity; there\'s not a\nlot of space left and I\'d likely have to trim out some already-present features to\nshoehorn in anything else. All the PICO-8 graphic space (both for sprites and maps) are\nfully used. All but a couple of the sound effects slots are used. The final version here\nis a careful balance between maxing out the token count and the compressed size. The raw\nsize is already too large to fit without minimization, too, and even with that many\nmanual tweaks are required making the code quite ugly in places.\n\nBuilding Minima\n---------------\n\nNormally PICO-8 applications are written in a special dialect of Lua and are immediately\ninterpreted within the PICO-8 environment without any special build steps. Minima is a\nlittle larger and more complicated than most PICO-8 applications, and it is too large to\nrun directly without a special minimization step. The `picotool`_ utility does most of\nwhat\'s needed, but at the moment unless this `special branch of picotool`_ is run with the\n`luamin2` argument, it\'ll break Minima.\n\nYou can also substitute in triplefox\'s version of the music. It\'s less like the original\nCommodore versions of the Ultima games but does a better job of making the most of what\nis available within the PICO-8 environment. It\'s in the `alt_music.p8` file. To use it,\njust copy over the existing `__sfx__` and `__music__` sections in `minima.p8` with the\ncorresponding versions found in `alt_music.p8`.\n\nDesign Notes\n------------\n\nMinima is mostly data-driven. It uses a JSON data structure to define the people,\ncreatures, and objects, and another JSON data structure to define all the maps and\ndungeons. Command sequencing uses coroutines in order to avoid overly-complicated\nstate machines. The "Minima Engine" can be reused for another game without having\nto modify too much code; if the target game is in a similar world to Miskatonia, not\nmuch more than the victory conditions would need to be changed on the code side. As\nof this writing, at least one other game makes use of the Minima Engine.\n\nOther Notes\n-----------\n\nI build this with lots of respect and love for the original Ultima series. I make no\nclaims of any rights to any of the intellectual property associated with it. Hopefully\neven my choice of naming this "Minima" (as opposed to "Ultima", get it?) helps convey\nthis notion.\n\nThe graphics and sound effects in it are based on my undoubtedly incomplete memories\nof the original games and are deliberately trying to convey the feel of playing those\ngames on the C64/128 as I experienced them, not be pixel-perfect representations of what\nthey really were. I\'ve drawn everything by hand and created the sound effects on my own,\nso while they have all been strongly influenced by those original games I expect they\'ll\nlook quite a bit different if compared side-by-side, so please don\'t bother to complain\nif you don\'t think something looks or sounds quite right.\n\nThe music is an attempt to recreate a little of the music that appeared in the Commodore\nversion of Ultima III. This was done with a combination of viewing various scattered\nnotes I found online with listening to recordings of the Commodore SID files. I couldn\'t\nfully match the time signatures used as the originals are fairly long, fairly complex,\nand do some pretty clever things. They also occasionally go outside the pitch range\navailable to PICO-8. Again, it\'s more about capturing the spirit than being a faithful\nrecreation.\n\nThis version makes use of Tyler Neylon\'s `json.lua`_ routine to parse JSON data; thanks\nto freds72 for his reference to it.\n\nThe additional `Lua`_ utility script `convert.lua` is used to make it easier to lay out\na dungeon map and turn it into something the game can use.\n\n\n.. _Minima at Lexaloffle page: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=31831\n.. _Minima Itch.io page: https://feneric.itch.io/minima\n.. _Ultima games: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_(series)\n.. _Ultima I: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_I:_The_First_Age_of_Darkness\n.. _Ultima II: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_II:_The_Revenge_of_the_Enchantress\n.. _Ultima III: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_III:_Exodus\n.. _Ultima IV: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_IV:_Quest_of_the_Avatar\n.. _Ultima V: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_V:_Warriors_of_Destiny\n.. _Ultima VI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_VI:_The_False_Prophet\n.. _C64: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64\n.. _C128: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128\n.. _GOG: https://www.gog.com/game/ultima_4\n.. _PICO-8: https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php\n.. _PocketC.H.I.P.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP_(computer)#Pocket_CHIP_and_Pockulus\n.. _xu4: http://xu4.sourceforge.net/\n.. _PocketInstaller: https://github.com/Feneric/PocketInstaller\n.. _picotool: https://github.com/dansanderson/picotool\n.. _special branch of picotool: https://github.com/Feneric/picotool\n.. _json.lua: https://gist.github.com/tylerneylon/59f4bcf316be525b30ab\n.. _Lua: https://www.lua.org/docs.html\n'
