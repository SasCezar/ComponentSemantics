Sorry T_T\n\n# How to run these games\n### Locally\nIf you wish to run them locally you need Pico-8! You can learn more about it [here](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).\nOnce Pico-8 is running type the following:\n- LOAD NAMEOFGAME\n- RUN (or press ctrl+r)\n\nOnce the game is loaded you can always press escape to make your own changes to the code, art, music and whatever else!\n\n### Web\nIf you don't own Pico-8, go [here](http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=9693&mode=carts) and play them in your browser without having to install any plugins!\n\n# How are they played\nArrowkeys to move, Z and X are action buttons. What they do depend on the game you are playing.\n"
