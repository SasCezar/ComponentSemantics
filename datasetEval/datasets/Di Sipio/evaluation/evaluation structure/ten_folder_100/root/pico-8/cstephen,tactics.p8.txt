b"# tactics.p8\n\nAn attempt to create a turn-based tactics game for the [PICO-8 fantasy console](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), similar in spirit to something like Fire Emblem, Shining Force, or Final Fantasy Tactics. My hope is that PICO-8's harsh code size limitations will keep this project small and focused so it has a fighting chance of being finished one day.\n\nWhile still very much incomplete, this game currently has:\n\n- A grid system with a selection cursor.\n- Unit archetypes with their own sprites, speed, and attack range attributes.\n- The ability to explore possible spaces to move based on unit speed and environmental obstacles.\n- The ability to determine possible attack targets given a minimum and maximum attack range.\n- A battle animation sequence showing each unit's stats.\n- A barren, unpopulated world map.\n\nHere are how things look so far:\n\n![Moving and Fighting](http://i.imgur.com/FbxZMxW.gif)\n\n*Explore possible moves (blue) find possible attacks (yellow) and initiate battle.*\n\nI've written about some of the challenges I've encountered at [my game development blog](http://www.craigstephenson.us/blog/category/game-development/). Stay tuned for more!\n"
