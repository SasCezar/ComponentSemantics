b'# Google Analytics for PICO-8\nEasy Google Analytics event tracking for all your PICO-8 games.\n\n![PICO-8 Google Analytics example](https://i.imgur.com/MGM435n.png)\n\nIt\'s very important to understand what\'s going on in your games and how players actually play your game. With this simple integration you can use Google Analytics with all your PICO-8 games (HTML export version) and track events according to your reporting needs.\n\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Add the code from [`event.lua`](./event.lua) to your PICO-8 source code. This will expose the `event()` function for tracking. The code uses 144 tokens in PICO-8.\n\n2. Add a Google Analytics snippet to your exported game HTML file, refer to this\n[link](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/).\n> Note: The snippet should be placed near the top of the head section and should look like the one in [`example-analytics-snippet.js`](./example-analytics-snippet.js). Don\'t forget to enter your personal tracking ID of your analytics property.\n\n3. Find the game\'s `<script>` tag in the exported HTML file with the form:\n\n```html\n<script async type="text/javascript" src="game_title.js"></script>\n```\nand add the script from [`pico8-google-analytics.js`](./pico8-google-analytics.js) right before it. \n\nYou can check out [`example.html`](./example.html) for a working example (add a tracking ID to test with your Analytics account).\n\n## Usage\n\nHaving added the code from [`event.lua`](./event.lua) to your game will expose a single `event()` function which can be used like this:\n\n```lua\nAPI:\nevent(category,action,label?,value?)\n\nexamples:\nevent(\'got item\',\'pick-axe\')\nevent(\'level 12\',\'clear\',\'found treasure\')\nevent(\'level 1\',\'win\',\'perfect\',64)\n```\nThe `event()` function is modelled after the Google Analytics send event method, i.e. event category and action are required and event label and value are optional.\n\n### Notes\n\n- The data to be sent via the `event()` function cannot exceed 128 bytes.\n- Obviously, event tracking will only work with the HTML version of your games.\n- If you host your game on pages like itch.io (i.e. where your game is embedded via iFrame) you should:  \n  - set the cookie option of the analytics snippet to \'none\' (as in [`example-analytics-snippet.js`](./example-analytics-snippet.js).\n  - use a separate Google Analytics property, because otherwise you will get a duplicate user count from your itch game page (if you use tracking there) and the actual iFrame of the game.\n  - be aware that with some browsers (Safari) tracking via an embedded iFrame might not work.\n\n### Tips for testing\n\n- Testing from a local html file (e.g. your-game.html) won\'t work since Google Analytics will block such requests.\n- Instead, either\n   - upload the game files to a server (or itch page) and test from there\n   - or run a local webserver. A simple solution can be [`local-web-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-web-server) (installed via npm).\n- You can use this excellent [Google Analytics Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna?hl=de) with Google Chrome to check for problems with your analytics snippet and to see if the event hits are fired correctly.
