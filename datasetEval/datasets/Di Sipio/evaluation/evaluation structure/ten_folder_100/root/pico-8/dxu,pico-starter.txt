Having more than one will cause the build commands to fail.\n\n### Load your cart\n\n- At this time, `pico-starter` does not decide how you load your cart.\n- Some potential options could be:\n  - Clone this repository directly into your carts folder\n  - Hard link your `.p8` into your carts folder\n  - Manually (or automatically) copy it yourself\n'
