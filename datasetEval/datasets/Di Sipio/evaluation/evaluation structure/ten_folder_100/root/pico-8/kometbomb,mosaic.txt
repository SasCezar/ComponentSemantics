b'# mosaic\n\nScript for combining four anim GIFs into one 2x2 mosaic. Made for tweeting nice combined screenshots of your PICO-8 projects.\n\nThe script assumes the input files are 256x256 (this is the default in PICO-8) animated GIFs of the same duration (and same frame rate). Please edit the script in case you want different dimensions.\n\nYou need to have [Imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php) installed!\n\n## Example\n\n 1. Save four GIFs in PICO-8 by pressing F9.\n 2. You can rename the saved GIFs as something like 1.gif, 2.gif etc.\n 3. Run mosaic.bat or mosaic.sh with the GIFs as input parameters as follows:\n    `mosaic.bat 1.gif 2.gif 3.gif 4.gif output.gif`\n\t(the input files go from top left to bottom right)\n 4. The script runs for a while and outputs the mosaic in a bit.\n 5. Tweet the GIF and you will get tons of retweets.\n'
